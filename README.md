# Quartz v4

helper function to [sync](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/setting-up-your-GitHub-repository) the repo to Github
```bash
npx quartz sync --help
```

I would use this one to sync the content since I have the vault somewhere other than `content`
```bash
npx quartz sync --directory "../jg-obsidian-pub"
```
