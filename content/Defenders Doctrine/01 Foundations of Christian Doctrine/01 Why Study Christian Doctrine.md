**[What is Christian Doctrine and Why Study It?](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/podcasts/defenders-podcast-series-3/s3-foundations-of-christian-doctrine/foundations-of-christian-doctrine-part-1)**

1. **Introduction to the Defenders Curriculum**
    1. Beginning a new, four-year series covering the entire range of Christian doctrine.
    2. Welcome to live stream participants (individuals and Sunday School classes).

2. **Three Purposes of the Defenders Class**
    1. **Train Christians:** To understand, articulate, and defend basic Christian truths.
        1. Understand: Know what Christians believe.
        2. Articulate: Explain beliefs to others.
        3. Defend: Give reasons for belief (1 Peter 3:15 - class verse).
           > [!quote]+ [[1 Pet-03#v15|1 Pet 3,15-16]]
           > <sup> 15 </sup>but set Christ apart _as_ Lord in your hearts, always ready to _make_ a defense to anyone who asks you _for_ an accounting concerning the hope _that is_ in you. <sup> 16 </sup>But _do so_ with courtesy and respect, having a good conscience, so that in _the things_ in which you are slandered, the ones who malign your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame. [[1 Pet-03#v16|]]
    2. **Reach Out with the Gospel:** Open, inclusive class welcoming non-believers (atheists, agnostics, seekers) to ask questions and express doubts.
    3. **Incendiary Fellowship:** Mutual encouragement and care, like logs in a fire, preventing isolation in a large church context.

3. **Overview of Topics Covered in the Series**
    1. Introduction to Christian doctrine.
    2. Doctrine of Revelation (how God reveals himself).
    3. Doctrine of God (what God is like, why believe in God).
    4. Doctrine of Creation (God's relationship to the world).
    5. Doctrine of Christ (person and work).
    6. Doctrine of Man (created in God's image, fallen, need for salvation).
    7. Doctrine of Justification (sin, salvation).
    8. Doctrine of the Church (what God is establishing on Earth).
    9. Doctrine of the Last Things (end of history, eternal state).
    10. Method: Cumulative, building week by week, moving at pace of discussion ("turtle method").

4. **What is Christian Doctrine?**
    1. Definition (following ==Jaroslav Pelikan==): What the church believes and teaches.
    2. Why this definition is preferred over "what the Bible teaches":
        1. Involves human reflection and systematization of Scripture (e.g., Trinity, two natures of Christ are results of reflection, not explicit phrases in Bible).
        2. Acknowledges diversity and different interpretations within the broad institution of the church (Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants differ).
        3. Allows for the concept of both true doctrine and false doctrine.

5. **Why Study Christian Doctrine?**
    1. **Every Christian is a theologian:** By being a Christian, you hold beliefs about reality. The goal is to be a *good* theologian.
        1. Spiritual maturity involves doctrinal discernment (Ephesians 4:13-15). 
           > [!quote]+ [[Ephes-04#v13|Ephes 4,13-15]]
           > <sup> 13 </sup>until we all reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to a measure of the maturity of the fullness of Christ, <sup> 14 </sup>so that we may no longer be infants, tossed about by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, by the trickery of people, by craftiness with reference to the scheming of deceit. <sup> 15 </sup>But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow into him _with reference to_ all _things_, who is the head, Christ, [[Ephes-04#v14|]][[Ephes-04#v15|]]
        2. Correct doctrine is crucial for the Gospel (Galatians 1:6-9 - strong condemnation of false teachers).
           > [!quote]+ [[Gal-01#v6|Gal 1,6-9]]
           > <sup> 6 </sup>I am astonished that you are turning away so quickly from the one who called you by the grace of Christ to a different gospel, <sup> 7 </sup>not that _there_ is a different _gospel_, except there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ. <sup> 8 </sup>But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim a gospel to you contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let him be accursed! <sup> 9 </sup>As we said before, and now I say again, if anyone is proclaiming a gospel _to_ you contrary to what you have received, let him be accursed! [[Gal-01#v7|]][[Gal-01#v8|]][[Gal-01#v9|]]
        3. Understanding sound doctrine is a qualification for eldership, and aspiring to this maturity is good for all Christians (Titus 1:9).
           > [!quote]+ [[Titus-01#v9|Titus 1.9]]
           > <sup> 9 </sup>holding fast to the faithful message according to the teaching, in order that he may be able both to exhort with sound instruction and to reprove those who speak against _it_. 
    2. **Right living presupposes right thinking about God:** Paul's epistles follow a pattern of doctrine (first half) followed by practical application ("therefore," second half) (Ephesians 1-3 then 4:1; Philippians 1-3 then 4:1). Skewed thinking leads to skewed living.
    3. **Study of doctrine expresses love for God with the mind:** The greatest commandment includes loving God with all your mind (Matthew 22:37-38). Studying, reflecting on, and knowing God's truth is a way to fulfill this.
       > [!quote]+ [[Matt-22#v37|Matt 22,37-38]]
       > <sup> 37 </sup>And he said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. <sup> 38 </sup>This is the greatest and first commandment. [[Matt-22#v38|]]
    4. **Christ cannot be separated from truths about Christ:** Abiding in the "doctrine of Christ" is necessary to have God (2 John 9-10).
       > [!quote]+ [[2 John-01#v9|2 John 1,9-10]]
       > <sup> 9 </sup>Everyone who goes too far and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. The one who remains in the teaching--this person has both the Father and the Son. <sup> 10 </sup>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into _your_ house and do not speak a greeting to him, [[2 John-01#v10|]]
        1. It's not enough to just "love Jesus" or have feelings; one must adhere to the truth about Christ.
        2. Requires a combination of doctrinal wisdom and Spirit-filled enthusiasm. Doctrine without Spirit leads to legalism; Spirit without doctrine leads to fanaticism.

**Discussion Portion**

- 1  **Q:** Do differences in doctrine lead to the formation of different Christian denominations?
  **A:** **Yes, denominational differences are often primarily rooted in doctrine**. They differ on what they believe Christian teaching is. While other factors like worship style or ethnicity can play a role, **major fault lines in the Christian church today would for the most part be drawn along doctrinal lines**.
- 2  **Q:** How does the principle that "Christ cannot be separated from truths about Christ" (Point V.D.) relate to recent denominational splits where one group appears to depart from core teachings? Are all doctrinal differences equally significant?
  **A:** **There is a significant demographic shift occurring, where historically prominent mainline denominations have often drifted from fidelity to biblical orthodoxy** (departing from truths about Christ) and are now in decline, while **more biblically orthodox denominations are growing or stable**.  
- 3 **Clarification**: **not every doctrine is a cardinal doctrine essential for salvation**. While truth is still involved in other doctrinal differences, not a great deal of consequence hangs on some of these less central doctrines, unlike cardinal doctrines such as God's existence or Christ's resurrection and atoning death.
