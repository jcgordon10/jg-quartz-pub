Christian doctrines are the church's core teachings derived from Scripture. Studying doctrine and apologetics is essential for understanding, defending, and sharing faith effectively in a skeptical world.

[[01 Why Study Christian Doctrine]]
Christian doctrine is what the church believes and teaches based on reflection on Scripture. Studying doctrine is vital for Christian maturity, right living, loving God with our minds, and a true relationship with Christ.

[[02 Why Study Christian Apologetics]]
Apologetics is the branch of Christian theology that provides rational justification for Christian claims. It is vital for shaping a cultural context where the Gospel can be heard, strengthening Christian believers intellectually, and effectively evangelizing unbelievers, including influential individuals.
