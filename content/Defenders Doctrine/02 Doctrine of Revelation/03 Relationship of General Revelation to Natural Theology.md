1. **Relationship of General Revelation to Natural Theology**
    1. **Natural Theology Defined:** The branch of theology exploring justification for God's existence using human reason and observation *apart* from authoritative divine revelation (Scripture).
    2. **Question:** How should we understand Paul's description of knowledge of God through general revelation in Romans 1?
        1. Is it an **inference** (like constructing arguments from creation or conscience)? Does Paul endorse natural theology?
        2. Is it a **perception** (a direct insight, simply seeing God's existence in nature/conscience)?
    3. **Argument for Inference:**
        1. Romans 1:20 states God's invisible nature is "clearly perceived *in* the things that have been made." The Greek suggests this perception is *through reflection* upon created things, implying rational thought or inference.
        2. The language in Romans 1 uses Greek terms (like *aidios* for eternal, *theotēs* for deity) that resonate with Hellenistic philosophy, suggesting Paul is engaging with or reflecting philosophical ideas about knowing God through creation.
        3. Strong resemblance to **The Wisdom of Solomon 13:1-9**, an inter-testamental Jewish work, which clearly describes an *inference* from created works to the Creator and calls worshiping the works themselves inexcusable folly.
        4. Paul's ministry in Acts:
            1. **Acts 14:17 (Lystra):** Paul points Gentiles who haven't heard the Gospel to God as the "living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them," noting that God "did not leave himself without witness" through giving rains and fruitful seasons. This is an appeal to nature as a witness or evidence.
            2. **Acts 17:22ff (Athens):** On Mars Hill, Paul addresses Greek philosophers, referring to "The God who made the world" and states God's purpose in ordering human life was "that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him." This implies rational searching and reaching out based on God's evident reality.
    4. **Conclusion on Romans 1:** Paul seems to endorse the project of natural theology, viewing the knowledge from general revelation as accessible through rational reflection or inference from the world and inner moral sense.
    5. **General Revelation vs. Natural Theology Arguments:**
        1. General revelation (nature, conscience) is God's inherent, constant self-disclosure ("traits of the artist," "fingerprints of the potter"). It renders people inexcusable.
        2. Natural theology arguments are *man-made formulations* based on reflecting on general revelation. They are fallible, revisable, and need re-articulation each generation.

**Discussion (General Revelation & Natural Theology)**

- **Q1:** What is the reference for The Wisdom of Solomon passage?
  **A:** The reference is The Wisdom of Solomon 13:1-9.
- **Q2:** Regarding Romans 1:18-20, does it mean general revelation makes God's eternal power and deity plain, and people are held accountable for suppressing this known truth?
  **A:** Yes, Romans 1 states God has made himself plain in creation (clearly perceived), making people without excuse. Verse 18 describes people *suppressing* this evident truth due to wickedness and moral darkness. This act of suppression confirms they know the truth they are rejecting.
- **Q3:** Do we get different attributes of God from nature vs. conscience?
  **A:** Yes, Romans 1 mentions God's eternal power and deity from nature, while Romans 2 indicates knowledge of the moral law (reflecting God's moral nature) from conscience. Thus, general revelation provides significant knowledge of God.
- **Q4:** Does God's desire for humans to seek Him (Acts 17) connect to the idea of inferring His existence from general revelation?
  **A:** Yes, God has not left himself without a witness, hoping people will seek and find Him based on the witness of general revelation, even during "times of ignorance" before they hear the Gospel. This seeking involves responding to the light given.

2. **Special Revelation**
    1. **Definition of "Special":**
        1. More **clarity** about God.
        2. More **fullness** of knowledge about God's nature, purposes, and plans.
    2. **Types of Special Revelation:**
        1. **The Living Word (Jesus Christ):**
            1. John 1:1, 14: Jesus is the Word (expression) of God, who became flesh.
            2. John 1:18: The Son (begotten God) in the Father's bosom has made God known fully.
        2. **The Written Word (Holy Scripture):**
            1. 2 Timothy 3:16: All Scripture is "God-breathed" (inspired) and profitable for knowing God and living righteously. It is God's Word to us. 
        3. **Particular Revelations:**
            1. Revelations in dreams, visions, prophecies, etc. (e.g., 1 Corinthians 14:26, 29-30). Paul calls these "revelation" in the New Testament context.
            2. **Distinction from Scripture:** While Scripture's truth is universally applicable, particular revelations are specific to a time, place, or person (e.g., Paul's call to Macedonia). They are not universally binding.
    3. **Do Particular Revelations Still Occur Today?**
        1. The New Testament describes them occurring.
        2. Cessationist arguments (that they stopped after the apostolic age/canon completion) are not necessarily convincing.
        3. Need for **discernment** (1 John 4:1): Test claims against Scripture (God does not contradict His universally applicable Word).
        4. Openness is warranted, particularly given accounts of God giving dreams/visions to those without access to the Gospel (e.g., Muslims in restricted areas). This may relate to the idea of the Gospel geographically spreading like the transition from old to new covenant.

**Discussion (Special Revelation)**

- **Q5:** Was particular revelation more necessary before the New Testament Scripture was written and widely available? Is Scripture now the standard to test such claims?
  **A:** Yes, particular revelations were likely very important before the widespread availability of Scripture. Scripture now serves as the universally applicable standard against which any claimed revelation must be tested for consistency.
- **Q6:** What is your stance on people today claiming to receive messages/prophecies from God through dreams or other means?
  **A:** Maintain humility and openness, as the New Testament shows these occurred and arguments for their cessation are weak. However, apply critical discernment (test the spirits), especially against Scripture. Don't be gullible, but be open to God working in various ways consistent with His revealed Word.
- **Q7:** Does Ephesians 4:1ff emphasize the oneness of God's communication across different forms of revelation (Living Word, Scripture, particular revelations) in being consistent?
  **A:** Yes, God's communication is consistent across all forms. This consistency is the basis for discernment. God is not limited, but His communication remains unified and consistent with Christ and Scripture.
- **Q8:** Are current instances of Muslims coming to Christ through visions support for ongoing particular revelation, especially where Scripture is unavailable?
  **A:** Yes, these accounts from areas without Gospel access support the idea that God continues to give particular revelations, acting in ways that address the specific situation of those who haven't chronologically entered the "post-Gospel-access" era.

Summary:
Natural theology uses reason to infer God's existence from general revelation in nature and conscience, a project supported by Paul in Romans 1 and Acts. Special revelation offers clearer and fuller knowledge of God, primarily through the living Word (Jesus Christ) and the written Word (Scripture), with possibility for particular revelations like dreams and visions, which require discernment.



==== old notes 

I. Natural Theology
- A. Natural theology: The branch of theology that explores justifications for God's existence through human reason, apart from authoritative revelation such as scriptures.
- B. Question: What is the Relationship of General Revelation to Natural Theology?

II. Romans 1 - Perception or Inference?
- A. Two views: Should we understand Paul's description of the perception of God's existence in nature as an inference or a perception?
    - 1.  Inference: God's existence is inferred by logically/rationally reflecting on the order and design in creation and on the moral law written in hearts, leading us to recognize the existence of a creator.
    - 2.  Perception: God's existence is perceived directly through our senses or intuition as we observe nature and through our innate moral knowledge.
- B. Evidence for Inference: Dr. Craig's position is that Paul is closer to the inference view.
    - 1. Romans 1:20: Says that God’s invisible nature is "clearly perceived in the things that have been made", which suggests it is through rational thought and reflection that God existence is perceived - it is not something that is self evident in and of itself.
    - 2.  Influence of Greek Philosophy: The language used bears clear similarities to Greek philosophy. Words like "aidios" (eternal) and "theotes" (divine nature) are specific to Greek philosophical discourse.
    - 3.  The Wisdom of Solomon: The intertestamental text, *The Wisdom of Solomon*, echoes Romans 1, arguing for a needed rational inference from creation to God.
        - Wisdom of Solomon 13:1-9:  Says that it’s inexcusable not to recognize the creator on the basis of his work, and that men who worship the creation itself are without excuse for failing to infer a transcendent God.
    - 4. Acts 14:17
        - a. Paul and Barnabas are mistaken for gods and are nearly worshiped.
        - b.  Paul says that God revealed himself in general revelation to all nations who had not heard the Gospel (that he had given them fruitful seasons, and satisfied their hearts with food and gladness).  This suggests general revelation can be sufficient to help one see the creator when considering creation.
    - 5. Conclusion: Paul endorses the project of natural theology.
- C. Relationship between Natural Theology and General Revelation
    - 1. Not Identical: The arguments for God’s existence are man-made product, while general revelation reveals himself through the traits of the art as we see it in the world around us.
    - 2. General revelation is the "stuff" or raw material humans reflect on, in order to formulate arguments for God’s existence.
    - 3.  Natural theology is fallible and revisable, but God’s general revelation is clear enough to render people inexcusable.

III. Discussion About General Revelation
- A. What is really Plain
    - Student: Romans 1:18 implies revelation is suppressed and that man will be accountable for not recognizing it.
    - Dr. Craig: Correct, Romans 1 says that revelation is available, but those who are wicked actively suppress it.
        - Attributes of God are recognized in the creation, as are moral attributes from conscience.
        - Bible is clear that God provides revelation in both nature and conscience.
- B. God Desires that Men Seek Him
    - Student: God's desire is that we seek Him.
    - Dr. Craig: Agreed. This is seen in Acts 17 and through Paul's sermon where he says they should seek God, that they should reach out and find Him, yet He is not far from each one of us.
        - Acts 17:24: When speaking to the Greeks, Paul clearly states that the Jewish God is the God of creation.
        - Acts 17:27: Says that God is not far from each one of us and there is a desire that we seek after Him.
        - Acts 17: 30: God overlooked past ignorance in favor of the new covenant and commanded all to repent.

IV. Special Revelation
- A. Special in two senses
    - 1. God reveals himself more clearly.
    - 2. God reveals himself more fully than through general revelation.
- B. Types of Special Revelation
    - 1. The Living Word: Jesus Christ (John 1:1, 14, 18)
        -   John 1:1: The word was with God and the Word was God.
        -   John 1:14: The Word became flesh and dwelt among us full of grace and truth.
        -   John 1:18: The Son has made God known (or God has made him known in some translations).
    - 2. Holy Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16)
        -   2 Timothy 3:16: Scripture is "God-breathed" and is a communication of Divine inspiration.
    - 3. Particular Revelations: Dreams, visions, prophecies.
        -   New Testament testifies that God communicates through these, as they are a form of revealing hidden truth, or general forms of communication from God.
        -   1 Corinthians 14: 26, 29-30: says "each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation... let two or three prophets speak and let the others weigh what was said".
- C. Difference between Scripture and Particular Revelation
    - 1.  Scripture is applicable to all, a universal truth.
    - 2. Particular Revelation is very specific at a specific time and place for the designated individuals.

V. Discussion of Special Revelation
- A. Oral Tradition
    - Student: It is logical that with limited access to scripture, special revelation was important to provide oral tradition. Also, Paul's "my Gospel", was an oral communication and should be considered that type of tradition.
    - Dr. Craig: That is a good point. Special revelations may have played a greater role when scripture was not readily available. The question of whether these continue today is an open one.
- B. Claims of Prophesy
    - Student: Many claim messages or prophecies via dreams and visions, what is your philosophy on those claims?
    - Dr. Craig: Have an attitude of humility and openness. But recognize that the New Testament teaches these things did occur, so I cannot rule them out. But it has to be tested/discerned and cannot contradict Scripture.
- C. Consistency
    - Student: All communications with God (special, living, and scripture) are consistent. God is not constrained, but still always consistent with the other revelations.
    - Dr. Craig: Yes, discernment is important and we are called to be discerning and test the spirits if they are from God. (1 John 4:1).
- D. Conversion of Muslims
    - Student: Many Muslims in the Middle East are converting to Christianity through visions, since no Scriptures are available.
    - Dr. Craig: This supports the idea that the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant didn't occur instantaneously, and that God has used general and special revelation through history.
