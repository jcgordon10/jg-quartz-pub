I'm reviewing this material not from the Defenders 3 series, but from [Defenders 4 (Defenders Live!)](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/images/uploads/09-biodiv-final.pdf) which is currently going.

[[01 Hermeneutical Principles and Concordism]]
This lecture introduces an excursus on interpreting Genesis 1 regarding the origin of life and biodiversity. It emphasizes the importance of hermeneutical principles, particularly considering literary genre and original audience understanding, while warning against "concordism" or reading modern science into the text.

[[02 The Literal Interpretation]]
This lecture examines the literal interpretation of Genesis 1, which sees it as a historical and scientifically accurate account of creation in six 24-hour days. It critiques this view based on genre analysis, arguing Genesis 1-11 is likely historical but uses figurative language, and introduces alternative interpretations that will be explored later.

[[03 A Critique of the Literal Interpretation]]
This lecture critiques the literal interpretation of Genesis 1, arguing that while tenable, it is not obligatory. Textual evidence such as the metaphorical use of "day" elsewhere in Genesis, the nature of the seventh day of rest, the creation of light before the sun, and the descriptions of vegetation growth and Adam naming animals suggest the narrative may use figurative language and isn't necessarily confined to six consecutive 24-hour days. Historical evidence also shows a range of interpretations has existed within Christianity and Judaism.
