Defenders is Dr. William Lane Craig’s lecture series on Christian doctrine and apologetics.
I have mainly watched the [Defenders 3](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/podcasts/defenders-podcast-series-3) series, but may watch the currently going Defenders Live! (4the edition?) for some of the evolution and creation arguments to see if there's new developments in the last couple years such as books from Craig or Josh Swamidass🌱

Christian doctrines are the church's core teachings derived from Scripture. Studying doctrine and apologetics is essential for understanding, defending, and sharing faith effectively in a skeptical world.
