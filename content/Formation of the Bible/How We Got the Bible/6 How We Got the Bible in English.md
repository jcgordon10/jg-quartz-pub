[[5 How the New Testament Was Copied|Previous Lecture]] |

1. Introduction
	1. Key Figures: John Wycliffe, William Tyndale, and the King James translators.
	2. Core Theme: The struggle to make the Bible accessible to ordinary people.
	3. Wycliffe's Story:
		1. Posthumous Punishment: Bones dug up, burned, and ashes thrown into a river.
		2. Heresy Charges: Denied the power of the Pope and held a strong view of predestination.
		3. Unpopular Act: Oversaw the translation of the Bible into English.
		4. Church View: The Bible was seen as the property of the clergy, not the laity.
		5. Wycliffe's View: Ordinary people should be able to read the Bible themselves.
			1. "Englishmen learn the law of Christ best in English"
	4. Wycliffe's Translation:
		1. Latin Basis: Translated from the Latin Vulgate, not the original languages.
		2. Word-for-Word: Initially a very literal translation of Latin.
		3. Improved Translations: Later editions were much better (smoother and truer to meaning).
		4. Dissemination: Sent out "Bible men" (later called "Lollards") to share the scriptures.
		5. Cost: Bibles were very expensive, copied by hand.
2. The Impact of the Printing Press and the Greek New Testament
	1. Wycliffe's Legacy:
		1. 170 portions of his NT survive.
		2. Condemned Posthumously: Made illegal to read the English Bible.
		3. Yan Huss: Influenced Huss, who was also condemned to die.
		4. Martin Luther: Influenced by both Wycliffe and Huss.
		5. Luther's Translation: Luther translated the Bible into German, directly from the original languages.
	2. Key 15th Century Developments:
		1. Gutenberg's Printing Press: Made mass production of texts possible.
		2. Fall of Constantinople: Scholars fled, bringing Greek manuscripts with them.
		3. Renaissance Interest in Ancient Languages: Greek classes started appearing in Universities.
	3. Erasmus's Greek New Testament:
		1. Primary Purpose: To showcase his new edition of the Latin Vulgate.
		2. The Result: He created the first published Greek New Testament.
		3. Poor Edition: His 1516 edition was poorly done (called a "most poorly edited book").
		4. Luther's Transformation: The Greek New Testament impacted Luther profoundly.
			1. Key Understanding: Realized that we are put right before God because of our faith, through grace.
		5. Improved Editions: Erasmus continued to revise and improve his work.
			1. Manuscript limitations: only 7 available, not the oldest or best.
		6. Widely Distributed: The "textus receptus" was widely distributed and widely copied.
	4. Stephanus's Edition:
		1. Basis: Based on Erasmus's Greek New Testament.
		2. Key Contribution: Introduced verse divisions into the Bible.
3. William Tyndale and the English Bible

		2. His Scholarship: Brilliant scholar fluent in 8 languages.
	2. Clash with the Church:
		1. The Church's View: Scripture authority was with the church.

		3. Last Words: "Lord, open the King of England's eyes."
	5. Aftermath of Tyndale:
		1. Matthew's Bible: Completed edition of Tyndale's work was published under Matthew's name.
		2. Great Bible: A revised edition of that was placed in every church in England.
		3. Legacy: Tyndale's translation influenced many English translations.
4. The King James Version
	1. Geneva Bible : Used in England, but with study notes.
	2. King James: Wanted a translation without marginal notes.
	3. Hampton Court Conference:
		1. The Puritans: Sought reforms to the Church of England.
		2. King James's Response: Rejected almost all requests, but agreed to a new translation.
	4. King James Translation:

		3. 1901: Published in the US as the American Standard Version.
		4. Hundreds of Translations in English now exist.
	7. Global Need:
		1. Vast Need: 180 million people lack any scripture in their language.
		2. Focus: at least 1,860 languages still need translation.
		3. Prayer: "Lord open our eyes to the need around us.”
5. Conclusion
	1. The English Bible owes a huge debt to dedicated men over centuries.
	2. God's word has been made available (and will be) to those who want it through those centuries of work.
