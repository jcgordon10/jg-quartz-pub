[[Formation of the Bible/How We Got the Bible/index|How We Got the Bible]]
Timothy Paul Jones's lectures on "How We Got the Bible" explore the Bible's unique nature, formation, and preservation across centuries. Beginning with the Bible's divine inspiration, inerrancy, and unified narrative, the lectures trace the development of both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing the importance of eyewitness accounts, meticulous copying, and careful selection of authoritative texts. Despite challenges and skepticism, the lectures highlight the reliable transmission of the biblical text and its accessibility through translations like the English Bible, underscoring the ongoing effort to make God's word available to all.
