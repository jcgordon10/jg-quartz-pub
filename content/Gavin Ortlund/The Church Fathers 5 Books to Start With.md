# 5 Books to Start with the Church Fathers

This video provides five suggested starting points for those new to studying the Church Fathers, aiming to make church history more accessible. The selections are chosen for their significance, relative readability, and in some cases, being currently undervalued. They also offer a cross-section of Eastern/Western and early/late patristic perspectives.

1.  [**Confessions**](https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Penguin-Classics-Saint-Augustine/dp/014044114X/truthunites-20) by Augustine (1:07)
    *   **Why Read:** Towering work, profoundly spiritual, theological, psychological, philosophical, and literary. Immense influence on Western Civilization (arguably second only to the Bible). Relatable due to Augustine's human struggles and story.
    *   **Recommended Translation:** John K. Ryan in the Penguin Classics series (older, accessible). Notes the FJ Sheed translation (more stately, closer to Latin) and the new Sarah Ruden translation (links to Trevin Wax's comment on this).

2.  [**On the Incarnation**](https://www.amazon.com/Incarnation-Saint-Athanasius-Popular-Patristics/dp/0881414271/truthunites-20) by Athanasius (2:48)
    *   **Publisher:** St. Vladimir Seminary Press (Popular Patristics series).
    *   **Why Read:** Compact, succinct (can be read in one sitting). Essential text. Known for his defense of Christ's deity, but this book also clearly presents his rich and multifaceted theology of the atonement.
    *   **Edition Note:** This edition includes a fantastic introduction by C.S. Lewis titled "On the Reading of Old Books," which Ortlund highly recommends as a first read for understanding the value of church history.

3.  [**On the Apostolic Preaching**](https://www.amazon.com/Apostolic-Preaching-Irenaeus-Saint-Bishop/dp/0881411744/truthunites-20) by Irenaeus (4:02)
    *   **Publisher:** St. Vladimir Seminary Press (Popular Patristics series).
    *   **Why Read:** Irenaeus is an earlier figure (late 2nd century). This is his shorter, less known, and more catechetical (for teaching, baptism prep) work compared to *Against Heresies*. Provides a comprehensive sense of how the early church saw scripture holding together, especially how Christ fulfills Old Testament prophecies. Ortlund sees it as a neglected/undervalued text great for getting into the patristic mindset. (Ortlund mentions he lost his copy and wants it back!)

4.  [**Book of Pastoral Rule**](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Pastoral-Rule-Gregory-Patristics/dp/0881413186/truthunites-20) by Gregory the Great (5:24)
    *   **Publisher:** St. Vladimir Seminary Press (Popular Patristics series).
    *   **Why Read:** From the later patristic era. Gregory is lauded for his shrewdness and psychological wisdom in leadership and practical pastoral theology. Highly beneficial for pastors and church leaders. A significant text historically, though Gregory's influence is less felt today than in the medieval era. Calvin positively referred to Gregory as "the last good Pope."

5.  [**Three Treatises on the Divine Images**](https://www.amazon.com/Treatises-Vladimirs-Seminary-Popular-Patristics/dp/0881412457/truthunites-20) by John of Damascus (7:21)
    *   **Publisher:** St. Vladimir Seminary Press (Popular Patristics series).
    *   **Why Read:** Provides the arguments for the veneration of icons from one of its best proponents (despite Ortlund disagreeing with the practice), offering insight into an alternative position. John is a window into the Eastern tradition, seen as a synthesizer of earlier Eastern thought, and also makes unique contributions.
    *   **Alternative:** His *Exact Exposition on the Orthodox Faith* is also a fascinating, shorter, constructive work representing Eastern tradition.
