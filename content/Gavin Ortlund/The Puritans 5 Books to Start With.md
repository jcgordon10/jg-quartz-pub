# 5 Books to Get Started with the Puritans

This video offers five recommendations for engaging with the Puritan tradition, which Ortlund sees as particularly rich theologically, spiritually, and devotionally. Many recommendations are from Banner of Truth's "Puritan Paperbacks" series.

1.  [**The Letters of Samuel Rutherford**](https://www.amazon.com/Loveliness-Christ-Samuel-Rutherford/dp/0851519563/truthunites-20) (0:20)
    *   **Publisher:** Banner of Truth (various editions, including a shorter "The Loveliness of Christ").
    *   **Why Read:** Devotionally rich letters, offering a sense of intimacy with Christ, especially amidst suffering. Ortlund calls them "nourishing" and highlights Rutherford's participation in the Westminster Confession.

2.  [**The Mortification of Sin**](https://www.amazon.com/Mortification-Sin-Puritan-Paperbacks/dp/0851518672/truthunites-20) by John Owen (2:28)
    *   **Publisher:** Christian Focus (this specific edition).
    *   **Why Read:** Focused on sanctification and putting sin to death (from Romans 8:13). Owen, considered by some the greatest Puritan theologian, offers a practical approach for those struggling with sin and seeking spiritual progress. Ortlund finds it convicting and encouraging, demonstrating that progress against sin is possible through Christ.

3.  [**The Heart of Christ**](https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Christ-Vintage-Puritan/dp/1941129218/truthunites-20) by Thomas Goodwin (3:46)
    *   **Publisher:** Banner of Truth (Puritan Paperbacks).
    *   **Why Read:** Emphasizes the affection and compassion that the ascended Jesus has for struggling believers. A powerful antidote to the intuition that God is disappointed or fed up with us, showing God's overflowing mercy and love. Influenced Dane Ortlund's *Gentle and Lowly*.

4.  [**The Bruised Reed**](https://www.amazon.com/Bruised-Reed-Puritan-Paperbacks/dp/1848718039/truthunites-20) by Richard Sibbes (4:34)
    *   **Publisher:** Banner of Truth (Puritan Paperbacks).
    *   **Why Read:** Based on Isaiah 42:3 ("A bruised reed he shall not break"), this book focuses on Christ's compassion for those who are spiritually bruised. It challenges the stereotype of Puritans as austere and is highly recommended for those struggling with assurance of salvation or having an overly sensitive conscience.

5.  [**The Reformed Pastor**](https://www.amazon.com/Reformed-Pastor-Puritan-Paperbacks/dp/1848712111/truthunites-20) by Richard Baxter (5:32)
    *   **Publisher:** Banner of Truth (Puritan Paperbacks).
    *   **Why Read:** Baxter (a somewhat different figure theologically) discusses godliness and character in ministry. The term "reformed" refers to personal godliness, not Reformed theology specifically. A great book for anyone aspiring to minister to others, emphasizing the pastor's role as a counselor and approachable figure for souls, like a physician for bodies or lawyer for estates. Edifying for Christians who want to bless others.
