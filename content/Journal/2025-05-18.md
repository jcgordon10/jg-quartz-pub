This morning at church we sang "Christus Victor." I was first introduced to this song when our Worship Pastor, Scott, chose it as our song for the year, to learn and meditate on.

A few weeks ago, my wife and I attended the [TGC25 Alive Together](https://www.tgc25.org/event/5c7c7875-3a03-451a-81bb-07826097b7f6/join-us-in-april?rt=N2XUd4fB3E-f9CRA_guVkA) conference, and we had the privileged of singing this song there with 7,000+ siblings in Christ. Singing with that many Christians is something I have participated in twice now, and each time it has been an entirely overwhelming and tearfully joyful experience. 

My wife and I agreed that we have each frequently felt the words of Elijah, [[1 Kgs-19#v10|"I am the only one left"]] as we go through life, and we need the reminder that we are not alone, that God has called a great crowd that no one can number, who long to serve before him day and night, no long hungering, no longer thirsting

<sup>9</sup>After these _things_ I looked, and behold, ==a great crowd that no one was able to number, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb==, dressed _in_ white robes and _with_ palm branches in their hands. <sup>10</sup>And they were ==crying out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!"== <sup>11</sup>And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, <sup>12</sup>saying, "Amen! ==Praise and glory, and wisdom and thanksgiving, and honor and power and strength _be_ to our God _forever and ever_== ^[Literally "for the ages of the ages"]. Amen!" <sup>13</sup>And one of the elders answered, saying to me, "These who are dressed _in_ the white robes--who are _they_, and from where have they come?" <sup>14</sup>And I said to him, "My lord, you know." And he said to me, "==These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation,== and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. <sup>15</sup>Because of this, they are before the throne of God, and they serve ^[Or "worship"] him day and night in his temple, and the one who is seated on the throne _will shelter_ ^[Literally "will take up residence over"] them. <sup>16</sup>==They will not be hungry _any_ longer or be thirsty _any_ longer, nor will the sun ever beat down on them, nor any heat, ^[An allusion to [[Isa-49#v10|Isa 49:10]]] <sup>17</sup>because the Lamb _who is_ in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and will lead them to springs of living waters, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."== ^[An allusion to [[Isa-25#v8|Isa 25:8]]] [[Rev-07#v10|]][[Rev-07#v11|]][[Rev-07#v12|]][[Rev-07#v13|]][[Rev-07#v14|]][[Rev-07#v15|]][[Rev-07#v16|]][[Rev-07#v17|]]

I'm thankful for my Pastor Scott, and his heart for choosing songs that are beautiful, moving, and theologically rich. As the song [sticks in my head](https://theologythatsticks.com/), I think about the words over and over, the biblical truth. God is so high and powerful and great and glorious and immense and nothing can stand before him, or beside him, or hide from him, and yet he chose to redeem me, to add me to that innumerable crowd of all kinds of believers whom he's chosen.

# Supper

We also had the Lord's Supper this morning, and as we partook it, I was thinking about what's I've been listening to about the [[Real Presence]] of Christ in his supper. I've added some notes there about the topic.
