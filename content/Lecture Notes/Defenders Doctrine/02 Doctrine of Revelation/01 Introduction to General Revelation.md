**[Types and Functions of General Revelation](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/podcasts/defenders-podcast-series-3/s3-doctrine-of-revelation/doctrine-of-revelation-part-1)**

1. **Introduction to the Doctrine of Revelation**
    1. Beginning the study of the traditional "loci communes" (common places/chief themes) of Christian theology.
    2. The doctrine of revelation is foundational, addressing how we discover God's will and mind.

2. **Authority in Christian Theology**
    1. The question of authority: Who has the right to speak about God? **Ultimate authority resides in God himself.**
    2. Definition of authority: The right to demand belief and obedience.
    3. God's authority is ultimate (no higher appeal) and unlimited (sovereignty over everything).
    4. Revelation is the means by which God discloses his will and mind to us.

3. **Understanding "Revelation"**
    1. Greek word notion: **Unveiling something hidden so it can be seen/known. Disclosure.**
    2. **Narrow sense:** Disclosure of something previously unknown/hidden from God (e.g., John's visions in Revelation, New Testament prophecy). Not all of Scripture is revelation in this sense (such as Luke assembling his account through research, or much of Paul's discourse).
    3. **Broad sense:** A communication from God. The Bible as a whole is God's communication to us, even if human authors used ordinary means (sources, interviews) to write it. This is the sense in which Scripture is God's Word to us and thus revelation.

**Discussion (Understanding "Revelation")**

- **Q1:** When we talk about witness accounts, even of miracles, does that fall under "general revelation" or "special revelation"?
    **A:** This question introduces the distinction between *types* of revelation (general vs. special), which is different from the *definitions* of revelation (narrow vs. broad senses) being discussed currently.

4. **Types of Revelation: General Revelation**
    1. **Definition:** God's revelation of himself that is generally available to mankind as a whole.
    2. **"General" in two senses:**
        1. **Universal Scope:** Available to everyone everywhere.
        2. **General Information:** Provides broad, general knowledge about God (e.g., a Creator/Designer exists), not specific information (e.g., Trinity, Christ's two natures). Results in a kind of generic monotheism.

5. **Types of General Revelation (Mentioned in Scripture)**
    1. **In Nature (Romans 1:18-20):**
       > [!quote]+ [[Rom-01#v18|Rom 1,18-20]]
       > <sup> 18 </sup>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and unrighteousness of people, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, <sup> 19 </sup>because what can be known about God is evident among^[Or "in"; or "within"] them, for God made _it_ clear to them. <sup> 20 </sup>For from the creation of the world, his invisible _attributes_, both his eternal power and deity, are discerned clearly, being understood in the things created, so that they are without excuse. [[Rom-01#v19|]][[Rom-01#v20|]]
        1. God has left his "fingerprints" in creation.
        2. His "invisible nature," specifically his "eternal power and deity," is clearly perceived in created things.
        3. This revelation is clear enough that people are "without excuse" for not acknowledging the Creator's existence.
    2. **In Conscience (Romans 2:14-16):**
       > [!quote]+ [[Rom-02#v14|Rom 2,14-16]]
       > <sup> 14 </sup>For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, _although they_^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as concessive] do not have the law, are a law to themselves, <sup> 15 </sup>who show the work of the law written on their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts _one_ after another accusing or even defending them <sup> 16 </sup>on the day when God judges the secret things of people, according to my gospel, through^[Or "by"] Christ Jesus. [[Rom-02#v15|]][[Rom-02#v16|]]
        1. God has implanted the moral law on human hearts.
        2. Even those without the specific written law (Gentiles) show that they know the law's requirements "by nature."
        3. Conscience bears witness to this innate moral knowledge, leading to self-accusation or excuse.
        4. People are held morally responsible for this knowledge.

**Discussion (Types of General Revelation)**

- **Q2:** Is general revelation simply creation itself, and within that, a general knowledge of God?
    **A:** Yes, revelation *in nature* is one of the types of general revelation. We see God's handiwork in the created order.
 ^0956e8
- **Q3:** When interacting with atheists, do you feel that some individuals are genuinely unaffected by general revelation, perhaps having suppressed it so much that their conscience is "seared"?
    **A:** Paul suggests in Romans 1 that suppression of the truth about God leads to darkened minds and self-deception, not necessarily outright lying. ==Alvin Plantinga== argues this indicates a "cognitive dysfunction" that prevents the proper apprehension of God, which the Holy Spirit's work helps to restore.
    > [!quote]+ [[Rom-01#v21|Rom 1,21-23]]
    > <sup> 21 </sup>For _although they_ knew God, they did not honor _him_ as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their reasoning, and their senseless hearts were darkened. <sup> 22 </sup>Claiming to be wise, they became fools, <sup> 23 </sup>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God with the likeness of an image of mortal human beings and birds and quadrupeds and reptiles. [[Rom-01#v22|]][[Rom-01#v23|]]

    > [!quote]+ [[Rom-01#v25|Rom 1.25]]
    > <sup> 25 </sup>who exchanged the truth of God with a lie, and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed for eternity. Amen.  ^7e44ec
- **Q4:** Are the moral values implanted in us through conscience a result of being created in [[Image of God|Gods Image]]?
    **A:** Yes, Christian theology affirms that bearing God's image gives humans intrinsic moral worth and grounds our apprehension of moral duties, particularly the fundamental value of other persons.
 ^9f7d99
- **Q5:** Was this moral sense ("knowledge of good and evil") created in Adam and Eve from the beginning, or did they gain it by eating from the tree?  
    **A:** Adam and Eve, created in [[Image of God|Gods Image]], would have had an implanted moral sense and conscience from the start, knowing the difference between right and wrong and that disobeying God was wrong. Eating the tree gave them *experiential* knowledge of evil.
 ^b5a710
- **Q6:** Why does Paul distinguish between "eternal power" and "deity" in Romans 1:20, as one seems to imply the other?
    **A:** The reason for the distinction is not explicitly stated. "Eternal power" includes two attributes (eternality and power), while "deity" (using the unique Greek word *theotēs*) may refer to the fuller concept of divine nature itself, potentially reflecting engagement with Greek philosophical ideas about God.

6. **Functions of General Revelation** ^020e45
    1. **To show forth God's glory (Psalm 19:1-4):**
       > [!quote]+ [[Ps-19#v1|Ps 19,1-4]]
       > <sup> 1 </sup>The heavens _are_ telling the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. <sup> 2 </sup>_Every day_^[Literally "day to day"] _they_ pour forth speech, and _every night_^[Literally "night to night"] _they_ tell knowledge. <sup> 3 </sup>There is no speech and there are no words; their sound is inaudible. <sup> 4 </sup>_Yet_ in all _the_ world their line^[LXX "line"] goes out, and their words to _the_ end of _the_ world. In them^[That is, the heavens] he has pitched a tent for the sun, [[Ps-19#v2|]][[Ps-19#v3|]][[Ps-19#v4|]]
        1. The heavens and creation declare God's majesty and handiwork.
        2. This declaration is universal, though not verbal language.
        3. Increased scientific knowledge of the universe amplifies this awe of God's creative power.
    2. **To render people morally culpable before God (Romans 1:19-20; Romans 2:15-16):**
        1. General revelation in nature removes excuses for rejecting God's existence.
        2. Innate knowledge of the moral law through conscience removes excuses for failing to obey God's standards.
        3. People will be judged based on this innate knowledge.
