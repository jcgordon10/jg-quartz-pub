1. **Relationship of General Revelation to Natural Theology**
    1. **Natural Theology Defined:** The branch of theology exploring justification for God's existence using human reason and observation *apart* from authoritative divine revelation (Scripture).
    2. **Question:** How should we understand Paul's description of knowledge of God through general revelation in Romans 1?
        1. Is it an **inference** (like constructing arguments from creation or conscience)? Does Paul endorse natural theology?
        2. Is it a **perception** (a direct insight, simply seeing God's existence in nature/conscience)?
    3. **Argument for Inference:**
        1. Romans 1:20 states God's invisible nature is "clearly perceived *in* the things that have been made." The Greek suggests this perception is *through reflection* upon created things, implying rational thought or inference.
        2. The language in Romans 1 uses Greek terms (like *aidios* for eternal, *theotÄ“s* for deity) that resonate with Hellenistic philosophy, suggesting Paul is engaging with or reflecting philosophical ideas about knowing God through creation.
        3. Strong resemblance to **The Wisdom of Solomon 13:1-9**, an inter-testamental Jewish work, which clearly describes an *inference* from created works to the Creator and calls worshiping the works themselves inexcusable folly.
        4. Paul's ministry in Acts:
            1. **Acts 14:17 (Lystra):** Paul points Gentiles who haven't heard the Gospel to God as the "living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them," noting that God "did not leave himself without witness" through giving rains and fruitful seasons. This is an appeal to nature as a witness or evidence.
            2. **Acts 17:22ff (Athens):** On Mars Hill, Paul addresses Greek philosophers, referring to "The God who made the world" and states God's purpose in ordering human life was "that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him." This implies rational searching and reaching out based on God's evident reality.
    4. **Conclusion on Romans 1:** Paul seems to endorse the project of natural theology, viewing the knowledge from general revelation as accessible through rational reflection or inference from the world and inner moral sense.
    5. **General Revelation vs. Natural Theology Arguments:**
        1. General revelation (nature, conscience) is God's inherent, constant self-disclosure ("traits of the artist," "fingerprints of the potter"). It renders people inexcusable.
        2. Natural theology arguments are *man-made formulations* based on reflecting on general revelation. They are fallible, revisable, and need re-articulation each generation.

**Discussion (General Revelation & Natural Theology)**

- **Q1:** What is the reference for The Wisdom of Solomon passage?
  **A:** The reference is The Wisdom of Solomon 13:1-9.
- **Q2:** Regarding Romans 1:18-20, does it mean general revelation makes God's eternal power and deity plain, and people are held accountable for suppressing this known truth?
  **A:** Yes, Romans 1 states God has made himself plain in creation (clearly perceived), making people without excuse. Verse 18 describes people *suppressing* this evident truth due to wickedness and moral darkness. This act of suppression confirms they know the truth they are rejecting.
- **Q3:** Do we get different attributes of God from nature vs. conscience?
  **A:** Yes, Romans 1 mentions God's eternal power and deity from nature, while Romans 2 indicates knowledge of the moral law (reflecting God's moral nature) from conscience. Thus, general revelation provides significant knowledge of God.
- **Q4:** Does God's desire for humans to seek Him (Acts 17) connect to the idea of inferring His existence from general revelation?
  **A:** Yes, God has not left himself without a witness, hoping people will seek and find Him based on the witness of general revelation, even during "times of ignorance" before they hear the Gospel. This seeking involves responding to the light given.

2. **Special Revelation**
    1. **Definition of "Special":**
        1. More **clarity** about God.
        2. More **fullness** of knowledge about God's nature, purposes, and plans.
    2. **Types of Special Revelation:**
        1. **The Living Word (Jesus Christ):**
            1. John 1:1, 14: Jesus is the Word (expression) of God, who became flesh.
            2. John 1:18: The Son (begotten God) in the Father's bosom has made God known fully.
        2. **The Written Word (Holy Scripture):**
            1. 2 Timothy 3:16: All Scripture is "God-breathed" (inspired) and profitable for knowing God and living righteously. It is God's Word to us. 
        3. **Particular Revelations:**
            1. Revelations in dreams, visions, prophecies, etc. (e.g., 1 Corinthians 14:26, 29-30). Paul calls these "revelation" in the New Testament context.
            2. **Distinction from Scripture:** While Scripture's truth is universally applicable, particular revelations are specific to a time, place, or person (e.g., Paul's call to Macedonia). They are not universally binding.
    3. **Do Particular Revelations Still Occur Today?**
        1. The New Testament describes them occurring.
        2. Cessationist arguments (that they stopped after the apostolic age/canon completion) are not necessarily convincing.
        3. Need for **discernment** (1 John 4:1): Test claims against Scripture (God does not contradict His universally applicable Word).
        4. Openness is warranted, particularly given accounts of God giving dreams/visions to those without access to the Gospel (e.g., Muslims in restricted areas). This may relate to the idea of the Gospel geographically spreading like the transition from old to new covenant.

**Discussion (Special Revelation)**

- **Q5:** Was particular revelation more necessary before the New Testament Scripture was written and widely available? Is Scripture now the standard to test such claims?
  **A:** Yes, particular revelations were likely very important before the widespread availability of Scripture. Scripture now serves as the universally applicable standard against which any claimed revelation must be tested for consistency.
- **Q6:** What is your stance on people today claiming to receive messages/prophecies from God through dreams or other means?
  **A:** Maintain humility and openness, as the New Testament shows these occurred and arguments for their cessation are weak. However, apply critical discernment (test the spirits), especially against Scripture. Don't be gullible, but be open to God working in various ways consistent with His revealed Word.
- **Q7:** Does Ephesians 4:1ff emphasize the oneness of God's communication across different forms of revelation (Living Word, Scripture, particular revelations) in being consistent?
  **A:** Yes, God's communication is consistent across all forms. This consistency is the basis for discernment. God is not limited, but His communication remains unified and consistent with Christ and Scripture.
- **Q8:** Are current instances of Muslims coming to Christ through visions support for ongoing particular revelation, especially where Scripture is unavailable?
  **A:** Yes, these accounts from areas without Gospel access support the idea that God continues to give particular revelations, acting in ways that address the specific situation of those who haven't chronologically entered the "post-Gospel-access" era.
