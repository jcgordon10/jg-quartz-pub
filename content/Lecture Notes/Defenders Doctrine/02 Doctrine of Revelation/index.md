[[01 Introduction to General Revelation]]
Revelation is God's disclosure of himself and his will, understood broadly as any communication from God and narrowly as unveiling hidden truth. General revelation is God's universal self-disclosure through nature and conscience, providing basic knowledge of his existence, power, deity, and moral law, functioning to display his glory and render humanity culpable before him.

[[02 Can General Revelation Lead to Salvation]]
General revelation in nature and conscience displays God's glory and renders people culpable for rejecting Him. While primarily revealing God as Creator, it provides a tragic possibility for individuals without access to the Gospel to avoid condemnation by a positive response, though few seem to do so. General revelation also prepares minds for the Gospel and provides a moral foundation that helps stabilize human society.

[[03 Relationship of General Revelation to Natural Theology]]
Natural theology uses reason to infer God's existence from general revelation in nature and conscience, a project supported by Paul in Romans 1 and Acts. Special revelation offers clearer and fuller knowledge of God, primarily through the living Word (Jesus Christ) and the written Word (Scripture), with possibility for particular revelations like dreams and visions, which require discernment.
