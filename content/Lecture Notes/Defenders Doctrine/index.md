Defenders is Dr. William Lane Craigâ€™s lecture series on Christian doctrine and apologetics.
I have mainly watched the [Defenders 3](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/podcasts/defenders-podcast-series-3) series, but may watch the currently going Defenders Live! (4the edition?) for some of the evolution and creation arguments to see if there's new developments in the last couple years such as books from Craig or Josh SwamidassðŸŒ±

These notes are mainly just outlines of the lectures and discussion questions. If I have commentary on them, I may add those in separate linked notes. This is more the reference material, and not personal thoughts.

Christian doctrines are the church's core teachings derived from Scripture. Studying doctrine and apologetics is essential for understanding, defending, and sharing faith effectively in a skeptical world.
