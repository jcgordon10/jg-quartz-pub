[[1 What's So Special About the Bible]]
The Bible is a diverse collection of 66 books spanning centuries, unified by a single story of God's kingdom and redemption. It is considered special because it is "God-breathed" (inspired), completely trustworthy and without error (infallible and inerrant), and provides sufficient truth for knowing God and living in His kingdom. Understanding and applying its message requires both careful interpretation and the Holy Spirit's illumination, leading to personal transformation and equipping for good works.

[[2 How We Got the Old Testament]]
The Old Testament is crucial as the foundational first part of God's salvation story, necessary for understanding Jesus. Composed over time by various human authors in Hebrew and Aramaic, the text was meticulously copied and preserved by scribes, with discoveries like the Dead Sea Scrolls confirming its remarkable stability. The canon, or collection of authoritative books, primarily follows Jesus' usage of the Hebrew Law, Prophets, and Writings, setting it apart from later additions like the Apocrypha. Ultimately, the Old Testament reliably points forward to its fulfillment in Jesus Christ and His kingdom.

[[3 How We Got the New Testament]]
Contrary to skeptical claims of embellishment, the New Testament is rooted in eyewitness accounts and early oral traditions, preserved and validated while many witnesses were still alive. The Gospels and other texts emerged from this context, ensuring a direct line of connection to historical figures and a reliable account of Jesus' life and resurrection. This makes the New Testament a trustworthy record rather than mere fantasy.

[[4 How the Books of the New Testament Were Chosen]]
The New Testament canon wasn't decided by Constantine or Athanasius, but rather recognized over time by the early church based on the apostolic authority of the writings themselves. Books were included if they were written by an apostle or a close associate, ensuring a connection to Jesus's original commission and aligning with established orthodox Christian beliefs. Thus, the church simply acknowledged the divinely inspired scriptures rooted in apostolic teaching.

[[5 How the New Testament Was Copied]]
Despite skeptical claims, the New Testament has been remarkably preserved through abundant copies, allowing textual critics to reconstruct the original text with a high degree of accuracy (97-99%). While variations exist, the vast majority are insignificant and none impact core Christian doctrines. This careful preservation, combined with textual criticism, allows readers to have confidence that God's word has been sufficiently maintained throughout the centuries.

[[6 How We Got the Bible in English]]
The English Bible's journey involved a struggle to make scripture accessible, with key figures like Wycliffe and Tyndale facing persecution for translating the Bible into the common language. Tyndale's work, based on the original Greek, heavily influenced later translations, including the King James Version, which became a widely successful and influential edition. Today, the ongoing need for Bible translations in various languages highlights the continuing effort to make God's word available worldwide.
