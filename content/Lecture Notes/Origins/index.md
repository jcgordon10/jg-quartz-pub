Dr. Craig from Reasonable Faith, has produced a significant amount of material trying to harmonize science, evolution, and other disciplines with the Bible.

Dr. Craigâ€™s lecture series on Creation with regards to interpretation and science

[[Is Evolution a Theory|Is Evolution a Theory?]]
Dr. Craig critiques Young Earth Creationist Jason Lisle's claim that "Evolution is not a Theory," arguing that evolution comprises multiple valid scientific theories well-supported by evidence. Craig refutes Lisle's challenges to evolutionary evidence, asserting that denying common descent over deep time leads to incredible "late creation" or scientifically indefensible Young Earth Creationism, which he identifies as the actual speculation. He advises Christians against attacking contemporary evolutionary theory.

[[The Origins of Young Earth Creationism]]
Michael Jones of "Inspiring Philosophy" shows that contrary to common claims, Young Earth Creationism (YEC) hasn't always been the standard Christian view. Historically, many Christians interpreted Genesis non-literally and accepted the prevailing scientific understanding of the Earth's age. Modern YEC, with its strict 6-day/6000-year creation, is a recent development largely stemming from the Seventh-day Adventist movement, not a longstanding, universal Christian doctrine.
