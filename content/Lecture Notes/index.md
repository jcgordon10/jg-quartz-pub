These are primarily summations and outlines of content that I have watched, read, or listened to. I think I will primarily keep these notes in the perspective of the source, and they will probably not contain much of my own commentary. I will likely save that for my [[Reflections/index|Reflections]] area.

- **[[Lecture Notes/Formation of the Bible/index|Formation of the Bible]]:** Information about the formation, preservation, inspiration, and mechanics of how the Bible came about.
- **[[Lecture Notes/Gavin Ortlund/index|Gavin Ortlund]]:** Summaries and notes on Gavin Ortlund's teachings, primarily focusing on church history and theological insights.
- **[[Lecture Notes/Defenders Doctrine/index|Defenders Doctrine]]:** Notes and summaries from William Lane Craig's "Defenders" lecture series on Christian doctrine and apologetics.
