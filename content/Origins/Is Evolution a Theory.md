**Is Evolution a Theory?**

1. **Introduction**
    1. Discussion with Dr. William Lane Craig on an article by Young Earth Creationist (YEC) Dr. Jason Lisle titled "[Evolution is not a Theory](https://biblicalscienceinstitute.com/origins/evolution-not-a-theory/)."
    2. Lisle claims Evolution should not even be called a theory.contrasts with Carl Sagan's statement, "Evolution is a fact, not a theory."
    3. Lisle targets Neo-Darwinian evolution: the idea of descent from a common microbial ancestor via mutations selected by survival advantage.
    4. Craig's immediate response: Lisle is correct that evolution is not *a* theory, but because it is *several* theories.

2. **Stages of Evolutionary Theory**
    1. Evolution is not a single, monochromatic theory.
    2. **Original Darwinian Theory (1859):**
        1. Thesis of natural selection (explaining adaptedness, "survival of the fittest").
        2. Thesis of common descent from one or a few primordial ancestors.
        3. Common descent was rapidly accepted by contemporaries.
        4. Natural selection was widely rejected for 70 years (didn't explain "arrival of the fittest" – origin of heritable traits).
    3. **Modern Synthesis (starts ~1930s):**
        1. Married Darwin's selection with Mendelian genetics.
        2. Explained origin of heritable traits through genetic mutations selected by natural selection.
        3. Sometimes incorrectly called "neo-Darwinism" (as Lisle uses it).
    4. **Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (Late 1980s-Present):**
        1. Challenged and replaced the Modern Synthesis.
        2. Incorporates insights from collateral disciplines, especially developmental biology.
        3. Exposes explanatory deficits of previous stages.
    5. Lisle is out of date by attacking the Modern Synthesis; needs to interact with the contemporary Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.

3. **What is a Theory?**
    1. Lisle notes some creationists mean "unproved assumption" when saying "evolution is just a theory," but this isn't the most common definition.
    2. Scientific definition (per Lisle): "A coherent group of tested general propositions, commonly regarded as correct, that can be used as principles of explanation and prediction for a class of phenomena." (Example: Einstein's theory of relativity).
    3. Craig agrees this is the scientific definition, but argues evolutionary theory *does* fulfill this definition (e.g., Futuyma's textbook lays out 20 fundamental tenets of the Modern Synthesis).
    4. According to Dr. Craig, denying evolution is a theory is a "silly" position. Agreeing that evolution is a theory doesn't mean the theory is true, just that it fits the definition.

4. **Evidence for Evolution (Lisle's Critique & Craig's Response)**
    1. Craig notes Lisle only surveys 3 of 7 lines of evidence for common descent.
    2. **Anatomical & Genetic Similarities (Homologs):**
        1. Lisle: Organisms' similarities allow for taxonomy (e.g., phylum, species); DNA is similar if anatomy is similar. Consistent with biblical creation, doesn't *imply* common ancestry.
        2. Craig's partial agreement: Taxonomy is possible without assuming genealogical relation (e.g., Linnaeus classified apes/humans similarly without common descent).
        3. Craig's counter-argument: What explains the similarities if not common ancestry?
        4. Lisle's explanation: "Perfectly consistent with biblical creation."
        5. Craig's critique of Lisle's explanation:
            1. Lisle doesn't define "biblical creation."
            2. If it denies common ancestry over deep time (~4 billion years), it requires "late creation" (God miraculously creates new organisms *de novo* throughout history).
            3. Craig finds "late creation" incredible and unbiblical (God's preference for process, e.g., water into wine, not magic-wand appearances). Example: dinosaurs suddenly popping into existence.
            4. Only alternative is Young Earth Creationism (world created ~10-20k years ago).
            5. Craig argues YEC is indefensible historically, linguistically, scientifically (contradicts geology, paleontology, cosmology).
        6. Examples of homologs: Pentadactyl limb (structural similarity across tetrapods), similar DNA sequences.
    3. **Genetic Language:**
        1. Lisle: All organisms use basically the same genetic language (code). Consistent with same creator.
        2. Craig's agreement: Near universality of the genetic code (DNA triplets coding for amino acids) is remarkable and powerful evidence for common descent.
        3. Craig's counter-argument against the "same creator" explanation:
            1. Sporadic variations in the genetic code suggest evolutionary change over time.
            2. Non-functional genes (e.g., pseudogenes, duplicated broken genes).
            3. Example: CMT1 gene duplication and mutation causing Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT). The identical duplicated broken gene is found in humans and chimps on the same chromosome at the same place.
            4. To explain this, it seems that either God would have had to intentionally give that specific cursed gene to both chimps and humans after the curse, or else those genes would have had to each randomly appear on their own separately in humans and chimps.
            5. This specific shared broken gene is too improbable by chance; it strongly suggests inheritance from a common ancestor.^[Dr. Craig reveals he has CMT Syndrome, inherited from his mother.]
            6. Denying common ancestry forces belief in "late creation" where organisms are created *de novo* with the same genetic code, which Craig finds "fantastic and unbiblical."
    4. **Fossil Record:**
        1. Lisle: Shows variations *within kinds* (consistent with creation's prediction of diversification within limits). Lacks *copious* clear evidence of transitions *between* created kinds (only disputed specimens). Consistent with creation, not neo-Darwinian evolution.
        2. Craig's partial agreement: Lack of abundant transitional forms *was* a problem for the Modern Synthesis's "gradualism" (change by small increments).
        3. Craig's response: This is addressed by the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis, which allows for "saltation" (evolutionary jumps/fits and starts) alongside gradualism. Denying gradualism doesn't deny common ancestry (e.g., Michael Denton).
        4. The fossil record *does* show a long history of life (~4 billion years) and progress (single-celled -> multicellular -> complex), which decisively falsifies the YEC "creation model."

5. **Predictions**
    1. Lisle's challenge: Any successful predictions of evolution contrary to creation?
    2. Craig's counter-examples:
        1. **Age of the Earth:** Overwhelming evidence for billions of years, contradicting YEC.
        2. **Specific Fossil Discoveries:** Prediction that whales evolved from land tetrapods led to targeting specific geological strata (e.g., Pakistan) and finding multiple transitional whale fossils.

6. **Rationality and Presuppositions**
    1. Lisle's point: Neo-Darwinian evolution is inherently irrational because if true, there's no basis for rationality/science (citing Alvin Plantinga's argument).
    2. Craig's correction: This is Plantinga's argument against the *conjunction* of *Naturalism* and Evolution. The argument shows naturalism is problematic when combined with evolution, not evolution itself.
    3. If God used evolution, it does not undermine rationality or knowledge of truth.

7. **Conclusions**
    1. Lisle's conclusion: Neo-Darwinian evolution is not proved, lacks supporting evidence, best called "speculation or unsubstantiated conjecture."
    2. Craig's conclusion:
        1. To avoid looking foolish, Christians should acknowledge evolutionary theory *is* a theory (or series of theories) and familiarize themselves with it.
        2. Young Earth Creationism (or creation science) is the actual "speculation and unsubstantiated conjecture about the past."    
        3. Attacking contemporary evolutionary theory makes Christians look "silly."
