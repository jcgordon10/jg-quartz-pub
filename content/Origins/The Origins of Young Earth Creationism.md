**The Origins of Young Earth Creationism**

1. **Introduction**
    1. Modern Young Earth Creationism (YEC) is often perceived as an essential, long-held Christian belief based on a plain reading of the Bible.
    2. According to Jones, this perception is a caricature; many Christians throughout history held different views on the age of the earth and Genesis interpretation.
    3. The modern YEC movement is relatively recent and has a peculiar origin.

2. **Defining Young Earth Creationism (YEC)**
    1. National Center for Science Education definition: Earth is no more than 10,000 years old, and the six Genesis creation days were 24 hours each.^[National Science Foundation - https://ncse.ngo/young-earth-creationism]
    2. Modern YEC organizations (Answers in Genesis, Creation Ministries International, Institute for Creation Research) generally hold to an age of around 6,000 years (e.g., based on 4004 BC).^[Creation Ministries International - https://creation.com/en-us/articles/6000-years; Institute for Creation Research - https://www.icr.org/article/how-old-earth-according-bible]
    3. Some YECs use the Septuagint, allowing for a slightly older age, but still under 10,000 years.

3. **Historical Christian Views on Creation and the Age of the Earth**
    1. **Challenging the "Always YEC" Myth:**
        1. Answers in Genesis promotes the idea that the early church for its first 16 centuries held to a young earth, quick creation, and global flood.^[Dr. James R. Mook - The Early Church on Creation https://answersingenesis.org/church/the-early-church-on-creation/]
        2. Jones argues this claim is contradicted by historical evidence, including some figures listed by AiG itself.
    2. **Early Church Fathers (Before Modern Science):**
        1. Many did not read Genesis days literally; some allowed for ages > 10,000 years.
        2. **St. Irenaeus of Lyons (2nd Century AD):**
            1. Responding to Gnostics, argued against literal 24-hour days based on 2 Peter 3:8 ("a day is a thousand years").^[St. Irenaeus - Against Heresies, book 5.23.2]
            2. Interpreted Genesis creation days as 1,000-year periods.
            3. Believed the world would end at 6,000 years (total age 12,000 years), technically exceeding the 10,000-year YEC limit.^[St. Irenaeus - Against Heresies, book 5.28.3]
            4. Key point: Showed Genesis 1 days were open to interpretation in the 2nd century.
        3. **St. Justin Martyr (2nd Century AD):** Seems to agree with the 1,000-year day interpretation.^[Justin Martyr - Dialogue with Trypho, 81]
        4. **Clement of Alexandria:** Did not believe in 6 literal 24-hour days. Seemed to believe in instantaneous creation, with Genesis days being figurative and ordering creations by importance.^[Clement of Alexandria - Stromata (Miscellanies), book 6.16] May have been influenced by Philo.    
        5. **Philo of Alexandria (Jewish Philosopher):** Advocated for instantaneous creation and figurative Genesis days.^[Philo of Alexandria - The Creation of the World, 3]
        6. **Other Church Fathers for Instantaneous/Figurative Creation:** St. Athanasius, Origen, St. Augustine, St. Basil, St. Ambrose, St. John Damascene.^[St. Athanasius - Four Discourses Against the Arians, book 2.48; Origen - Against Celsus, book 6.50-61; On First Principles, book 4.3.1; St. Augustine - The Literal Meaning, book 1.10, 4.27, 5.3.6; St. Basil - Hexaemeron, Homily 1.6, 5-10; St. Ambrose - Hexaemeron,. 10. 37; St. John Damascene, - De Fide Orthodoxa, 2.1]
        7. **St. Augustine:**
            1. Taught Genesis days were "God-divided" or part of a single "day" (referencing Genesis 2:4).^[St. Augustine - The Literal Meaning, book 4.27]
            2. Believed God created all things simultaneously, and the six days were a narrative structure for human understanding.^[St. Augustine - The Literal Meaning, book 5.3.6]
        8. Although these figures might technically be "young earth" (not stating an age > 6k years), they did *not* hold that a *literal* 24-hour reading was required by Genesis 1. Non-literal readings were common early on.
    3. **Middle Ages:**
        1. Non-literal readings persisted.
        2. **William of Conches:** Advocated for a non-literal Genesis reading. Suggested Adam's creation from dust implied humans could come from natural elements, indicating a natural process under God.^[William of Conches - The Dragmaticon Philosophia]
        3. **Robert Grosseteste:** Followed Augustine, seeing Genesis days as metaphorical. God created light and matter, which developed into the rest of creation over time.^[A. C. Sparavigna - "Robert Grosseteste's Thought on Light and Form of the World." International Journal of Sciences Vol.3, April 2014 (4)]
        4. **Dominant View:** While diversity existed, many (e.g., Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler) accepted dates around 4000 BC, not due to a strict reading of Genesis, but because limited scientific evidence at the time supported it.^[Michael Roberts, via L. Piccardi & W. B. Masse - Myth and Geology, 39-40]
    4. **Reformation Era & Onward:**
        1. **John Calvin:** Saw Genesis as accommodated to human understanding, not a science textbook (e.g., astronomy), allowing Protestants to accept future scientific findings.^[Reijer Hooykass - Religion and the Rise of Science; B. Ferngren - Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction]
        2. **Gap Interpretation (Chaos-Restitution):** Became dominant by the 18th century.
            1. Genesis 1:1 (creation) followed by an unspecified time gap (chaos/void).
            2. God reworked the chaotic earth in six days.
            3. Some suggested the gap could be millions of years.
            4. Some added the idea of 1,000-year days.
            5. Supported by figures like Thomas Burnet, William Whiston, Immanuel Kant, John Wesley, John Milton.^[L. Piccardi & W. B. Masse - Myth and Geology, 41]
        3. **Rise of Geology:** By the late 18th/19th centuries, geology revealed an ancient Earth.
            1. Few theologians opposed geology; most saw it as compatible with Genesis (often via the Gap or Day-Age interpretations).      
            2. Christians used geology to counter Deist/Eternalist ideas of an uncreated earth.^[Nicholas Rupke via Ronald Numbers - Darwinism Comes to America; Nicholas Rupke via Ronald Numbers - The Creationists (Expanded Edition)]
            3. Ironically, some arguments later used *against* geology by YECs (like Charles Lyell's steady-state model arguments) were adapted from historical geology.^[B. Ferngren - Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction]
            4. Examples of acceptance: Rev. James Douglas (1785) promoted six expanses of time; Rev. Richard Maine (1865) called belief in a 6,000-year-old earth a "delusion" among educated people.^[L. Piccardi & W. B. Masse - Myth and Geology]
        4. **Before the late 20th century, a strict six-day, ~6k year creation was *never* the dominant view or official position of any major church in Europe or America.**

4. **Christian Response to Darwinian Evolution (Pre-1960s)**
    1. Many Christians did *not* see conflict between evolution and Genesis.^[Ronald Numbers - Darwinism Comes to America; D. N Livingstone - Darwin's Forgotten Defenders; J. R. Moore - The Post-Darwinian Controversies]
    2. Figures who accepted or promoted evolution: Asa Gray (botanist), James McCosh, James Dwight Dana, Richard Owen (paleontologist, theistic evolution), St. George Jackson Mivart (zoologist, theistic evolution).^[Ronald Numbers - The Creationists (Expanded Edition); B. Zon & B. Lightman - Evolution and Victorian Culture.; Michael Ruse, ‎Robert J. Richards - The Cambridge Companion to the 'Origin of Species]
    3. **B.B. Warfield:** Theologian, self-described "pure Darwinist" and Christian fundamentalist.^[B. B. Warfield, B.B - Evolution, Scripture, and Science: Selected Writings]
    4. Evolution taught in many church-related colleges, even in the conservative South, prior to the 1920s.^[Ronald Numbers - The Creationists (Expanded Edition)]
    5. Mainstream Christian geologists/paleontologists reconciled geology/paleontology with religious belief.

5. **The Rise of Modern YEC (Post-1960s)**
    1. Organized resistance to evolution began in the 1920s, but initially, most "creationists" were old-earthers (Gap or Day-Age theory).^[Ronald Numbers - Darwinism Comes to America]   
    2. The Scofield Reference Bible (widely popular) promoted the Gap Theory.
    3. Figures like William Jennings Bryan (prosecutor in Scopes Trial) were Day-Age proponents, not YECs, and had no theological objections to evolution before humans.
    4. **Origin of the Modern YEC Movement:** Traced largely to the Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) movement.
        1. SDAs were a minority group, sometimes seen as heretical.^[The 1957 Seventh-day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine: https://web.archive.org/web/20220513085436/https://www.sdanet.org/atissue/books/qod/index.htm]
        2. Founded by Ellen G. White, who claimed visions.
        3. White claimed visions showed creation in six literal 24-hour days and a global flood causing geological layers.^[Ronald Numbers - The Creationists (Expanded Edition)]
    5. **George McCready Price:**
        1. SDA, armchair geologist.
        2. Argued the geological column was entirely laid down by Noah's Flood ("Flood Geology").
        3. Taught a 6,000-year-old Earth and six-day creation (based on White's visions).
        4. Basis for many modern YEC arguments:
            1. Claim that the geological column uses circular reasoning (dating rocks by fossils, fossils by rocks).^[George McCready Price - Back to the Bible, 3rd Ed.; George McCready Price - Selected Works of George McCready Price]
            2. Appeals to 2 Peter 3 (scoffers in the last days, interpreted as modern evolutionists).^[George McCready Price - Selected Works of George McCready Price]
            3. Use of Exodus 20:11 (creation week had to be normal week).^[Ronald Numbers - The Creationists (Expanded Edition)]
            4. Idea that scientists view facts through a lens (like Darwin/Lyell), just as creationists view through scripture.^[George McCready Price - Geology and the Recapitulation Theory: A study in Circular Reasonin https://creationconcept.info/gmprice1.html]
        5. Price's ideas were mostly rejected by fundamentalists of his day and few followers before the 1970s. (including some like the degeneration of humanity into black people and apes^[George McCready Price - The Phantom of Organic Evolution pp 103-112, 210; George McCready Price - "The White and the Brown," from Price Papers])
        6. Price argued for a young *Earth* and *life*, but not necessarily a young *universe* (due to White's visions of other planets).   
    6. **The Genesis Flood (1961):**^[Ronald Numbers - The Creationists (Expanded Edition)]
        1. Bernard Ramm's 1954 book critiquing Flood Geology sparked John Whitcomb Jr. (theologian) to defend Price's views in his dissertation.
        2. Whitcomb sought a scientist co-author; Henry Morris (hydraulic engineer, not geologist) agreed after geologists refused.
        3. Whitcomb and Morris recycled many of Price's old arguments but distanced themselves from Price.
        4. They *did* argue for a young universe (unlike Price).
        5. Introduced arguments like the pre-Flood vapor canopy (explaining long lifespans and altering dating).
        6. Published without a geologist endorsement; sold well and made Morris and Whitcomb celebrities.
        7. Scientific community rejected the thesis, recognizing arguments from Price. Morris and Whitcomb tried to make it not about the details of the science, but about biblical authority.^[Henry M. Morris and John C. Whitcomb Jr. (June 1964), "Reply to Reviews," Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation 16, 59-61]
           "The real issue is not the correctness of the interpretation of various details of the geological data, but simply what God has revealed in his word concerning these matters."
    7. **Institutionalization:**
        1. Creation Research Society formed soon after (struggled to find geologists).
        2. Institute for Creation Research (ICR) formed by Morris.
        3. ICR helped give rise to organizations like Creation Ministries International and Answers in Genesis.
    8. By the 1990s, "creationist" became synonymous with "Young Earth Creationist." A minority view linked to SDA origins became the defining position.^[Ronald Numbers - The Creationists (Expanded Edition); Ronald Numbers - The Maritimes Birth of Creation Science. Lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJaiHLrUsUU]

6. **Conclusion**
    1. While *some* historical Christians believed the Earth was young based on the science *of their time*, this was not a dogmatic, uniform belief stemming from a strict reading of Genesis.
    2. Non-literal interpretations of Genesis (Day-Age, Gap, Figurative/Instantaneous) were common throughout Christian history.
    3. The modern, dogmatic adherence to YEC traces significantly back to the specific claims of George McCready Price and the popularization efforts of Henry Morris and John Whitcomb Jr., largely fueled by Seventh-day Adventist origins and Ellen G. White's visions, not a historical, mainline Christian tradition.
    4. Christianity has historically been compatible with multiple interpretations of Genesis, and the age of the earth was not a pivotal, undisputed issue before the modern YEC movement.

Summary:
This video by Michael Jones of "Inspiring Philosophy" challenges the modern claim that Young Earth Creationism (YEC) has always been the standard Christian belief derived from a plain reading of Genesis. He presents historical evidence showing that many Christians throughout history, including early church fathers, interpreted Genesis non-literally (e.g., 1000-year days, instantaneous creation, narrative structure, gap theory) and often accepted the scientific understanding of the earth's age prevalent in their time, even before modern geology. The video argues that the modern YEC movement, defining itself by a literal 6-day, ~6000-year creation, is a relatively recent phenomenon tracing its specific arguments and popularization largely to the Seventh-day Adventist movement and figures like George McCready Price, Henry Morris, and John Whitcomb Jr., rather than a historical, universally held Christian doctrine.
