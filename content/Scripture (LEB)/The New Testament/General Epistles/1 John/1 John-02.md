###### v1
My little children, I am writing these _things_ to you in order that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous _one_,

###### v2
and he ^[Or "he himself" (emphatic)] is the propitiation ^[Or "expiation"; or "atoning sacrifice"] for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for _the sins of_ the whole world.

###### v3
And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments.

###### v4
The one who says "I have come to know him," and does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in this person.

###### v5
But whoever keeps his word, truly in this person the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in him.

###### v6
The one who says _that he_ resides in him ought also to walk ^[Some manuscripts have "to walk in this way"] just as that one walked.

###### v7
Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the message which you have heard.

###### v8
Again, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you, because ^[Or perhaps "that"] the darkness is passing away and the true light already is shining.

###### v9
The one who says _he_ is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness until now.

###### v10
The one who loves his brother resides in the light, and _there_ is no cause for stumbling in him.

###### v11
But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

###### v12
I am writing to you, little children, because ^[Or "that"] your sins have been forgiven you on account of his name.

###### v13
I am writing to you, fathers, because ^[Or "that"] you have known the _One who is_ from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because ^[Or "that"] you have conquered the evil one.

###### v14
I have written to you, children, because ^[Or "that"] you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because ^[Or "that"] you have known the _One who is_ from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ^[Or "that"] you are strong, and the word of God resides in you, and you have conquered the evil one.

###### v15
Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him,

###### v16
because everything _that is_ in the world--the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the arrogance of material possessions--is not from the Father, but is from the world.

###### v17
And the world is passing away, and its desire, ^[Or "and the desire for it"] but the one who does the will of God remains _forever_ ^[Literally "for the age"].

###### v18
Children, it is the last hour, and just as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen, by which we know that it is the last hour.

###### v19
They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us. But _they went out_ ^[This is an understood repetition of the phrase "they went out" from the beginning of v. [[1 John-02#v19|19]]], in order that it might be shown that all of them are not of us.

###### v20
And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.

###### v21
I have not written to you because ^[Or "that"] you do not know the truth, but because ^[Or "that"] you do know it, and because ^[Or "that"] every lie is not of the truth.

###### v22
Who is the liar except the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This person is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.

###### v23
Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father _either_; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also.

###### v24
_As for_ you, what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.

###### v25
And this is the promise which he himself promised us: eternal life.

###### v26
These _things_ I have written to you concerning the ones who are trying to deceive you.

###### v27
And _as for_ you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not have need that anyone teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all _things_, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you reside ^[By form the verb could also be imperative: "just as it has taught you, reside in him"] in him.

###### v28
And now, little children, remain in him, so that whenever he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming.

###### v29
If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone ^[Some manuscripts have "everyone also"] who practices righteousness has been fathered by him.
