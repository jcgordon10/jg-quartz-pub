###### v1
See what sort of love the Father has given to us: that we should be called children of God, and we are! Because of this the world does not know us: because it did not know him.

###### v2
Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that whenever he is revealed we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is.

###### v3
And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as that one is pure.

###### v4
Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.

###### v5
And you know that that one was revealed in order that he might take away sins, and in him _there_ is no sin.

###### v6
Everyone who resides in him does not sin. Everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him.

###### v7
Little children, let no one deceive you: the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as that one is righteous.

###### v8
The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this _reason_ the Son of God was revealed: in order to destroy the works of the devil.

###### v9
Everyone who is fathered by God does not practice sin, because his seed resides in him, and _he is_ not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God.

###### v10
By this the children of God and the children of the devil are evident: everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, namely, the one who does not love his brother.

###### v11
For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning: that we should love one another,

###### v12
not as Cain, who was of the evil one and violently murdered his brother. And _for what reason_ ^[Literally "on account of what"] did he violently murder him? Because his deeds were evil and the _deeds_ of his brother _were_ righteous.

###### v13
Do not marvel, ^[Some manuscripts have "And do not marvel"] brothers, if the world hates you.

###### v14
We know that we have passed over from death to life because we love the brothers. The one who does not love remains in death.

###### v15
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that every murderer does not have eternal life residing in him.

###### v16
We have come to know love by this: that _he_ ^[Literally "that one" (referring to Jesus Christ)] laid down his life on behalf of us, and we ought to lay down our lives on behalf of the brothers.

###### v17
But whoever has the world's material possessions and observes his brother _in need_ ^[Literally "having need"] and shuts his heart against him, how does the love of God reside in him?

###### v18
Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth.

###### v19
By this ^[Some manuscripts have "And by this"] we know that we are of the truth and will convince our heart before him,

###### v20
that ^[Or "because"] if our heart condemns us, that God is greater than our heart and knows all _things_.

###### v21
Dear friends, if our heart does not condemn _us_, we have confidence before God,

###### v22
and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do _what is_ pleasing _in his sight_ ^[Literally "in the sight of him"].

###### v23
And this is his commandment: that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as _he commanded us_ ^[Literally "he gave us commandment"].

###### v24
And the one who keeps his commandments resides in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he resides in us: by the Spirit whom he has given to us.
