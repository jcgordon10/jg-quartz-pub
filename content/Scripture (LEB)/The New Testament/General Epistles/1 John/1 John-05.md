[[1 John-04|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been fathered by God, and everyone who loves _the father_ ^[Literally "the one who fathers"] also loves the _child_ fathered by him.

###### v2
By this we know that we love the children of God: whenever we love God and keep his commandments.

###### v3
For this is the love of God: that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome,

###### v4
because everyone who is fathered by God conquers the world.
And this is the victory which has conquered the world: our faith.

###### v5
Now who is the one who conquers the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?

###### v6
This is the one who came by water and blood--Jesus Christ, not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.

###### v7
For _there_ are three that testify, ^[Later Latin manuscripts add the following words to v. [[1 John-05#v7|7]] and v. [[1 John-05#v8|8]]: "in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one. 8 And there are three that testify on earth"]

###### v8
the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are _in agreement_ ^[Literally "for the one"].

###### v9
If we receive the testimony of people, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son.

###### v10
(The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. The one who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning his Son.)

###### v11
And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.

###### v12
The one who has the Son has the life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.

###### v13
These _things_ I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life.

###### v14
And this is the confidence that we have before him: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.

###### v15
And if we know that he hears us _in_ whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him.

###### v16
If anyone should see his brother sinning a sin not _leading_ to death, he should ask, and he will grant life to him, to those who sin not _leading_ to death. (_There_ is a sin _leading_ to death; I do not say that he should ask about that.

###### v17
All unrighteousness is sin, and _there_ is a sin not _leading_ to death.)

###### v18
We know that everyone who is fathered by God does not sin, but the one fathered by God, he protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.

###### v19
We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in _the power of_ the evil one.

###### v20
And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, in order that we may know the one who is true, and we are in the one who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This one is the true God and eternal life.

###### v21
Little children, guard yourselves from idols.
