whom, _although you_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("seen") which is understood as concessive] have not seen, you love; in whom now you believe, _although you_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("see") which is understood as concessive] do not see _him_, and you rejoice greatly with joy inexpressible and full of glory,

###### v12
to whom it was revealed that they were serving not themselves but you with reference to the same _things_ which now have been announced to you through those who proclaimed the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, _things into which_ ^[Literally "into which _things_"] angels desire to look.

"all flesh _is_ like grass,
and all its glory like the flower of the grass.
The grass withers and the flower falls off,
