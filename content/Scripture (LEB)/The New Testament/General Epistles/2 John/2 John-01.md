###### v1
The elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth--and not I alone, but also all those who know the truth--

###### v2
because of the truth that resides in us and will be with us _forever_ ^[Or "in perpetuity"; literally "for the age"].

###### v3
Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father in truth and love.

###### v4
_I was very glad_ ^[Literally "I rejoiced exceedingly"] because I found _some_ of your children walking in _the_ truth, just as _the Father commanded us_ ^[Literally "we received commandment from the Father"].

###### v5
And now I ask you, lady (not as _if I were_ writing a new commandment to you, but _one_ that we have had from the beginning), that we should love one another.

###### v6
And this is love: that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.

###### v7
For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ ^[Or "confess Jesus _as_ Christ coming in _the_ flesh" (see [[1 John-04#v2|1 John 4:2]])] coming in _the_ flesh. This person is the deceiver and the antichrist!

###### v8
Watch yourselves that you do not lose what we have worked for, but receive a full reward.

###### v9
Everyone who goes too far and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. The one who remains in the teaching--this person has both the Father and the Son.

###### v10
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into _your_ house and do not speak a greeting to him,

###### v11
because the one who speaks a greeting to him shares in his evil deeds.

###### v12
_Although_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as concessive] I have many _things_ to write to you, I do not want _to do so_ by means of paper and ink, but I hope to be with you and to speak _face to face_ ^[Literally "mouth to mouth"], so that your ^[Some manuscripts have "our"] joy may be complete.

###### v13
The children of your elect sister greet you.
