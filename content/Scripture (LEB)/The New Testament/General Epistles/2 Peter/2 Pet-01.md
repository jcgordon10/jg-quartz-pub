[[2 Pet-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Simeon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a faith equal in value to ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.

###### v2
May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,

###### v3
because his divine power has bestowed on us all _things_ _that are_ necessary for life and godliness, through the knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence of character,

###### v4
through which things he has bestowed on us his precious and very great promises, so that through these you may become sharers of the divine nature _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("escaping from") which is understood as temporal] escaping from the corruption _that is_ in the world because of evil desire,

###### v5
and _for_ this same _reason_, and _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("applying") which is understood as means] applying all diligence, supply with your faith excellence of character, and with excellence of character, knowledge,

###### v6
and with knowledge, self-control, and with self-control, patient endurance, and with patient endurance, godliness,

###### v7
and with godliness, brotherly love, and with brotherly love, love.

###### v8
For _if_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as conditional] these _things_ are yours and are increasing, this does not make _you_ useless or unproductive in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

###### v9
For _the one_ for whom these _things_ _are_ not present is blind, being nearsighted, _having forgotten the cleansing_ ^[Literally "receiving forgetfulness of the cleansing"] of his former sins.

###### v10
Therefore, brothers, be zealous even more to make your calling and election secure, because _if you_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("do") which is understood as conditional] do these _things_, you will never ever stumble.

###### v11
For in this way entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied for you.

###### v12
Therefore I intend to remind you continually concerning these _things_, although _you_ know _them_ and are established in the truth that you have.

###### v13
But I consider _it_ right, for as long as I am in this habitation, to stir you up by a reminder,

###### v14
_because I_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal] know that the removal of my habitation is imminent, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.

###### v15
And I will also make every effort _that_ you are able at any time, after my departure, _to recall these things to mind_ ^[Literally "to make recollection of these"].

###### v16
For we did not make known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("following") which is understood as means] following ingeniously concocted myths, but _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("being") which is understood as means] being eyewitnesses of that one's majesty.

###### v17
For _he_ received honor and glory from God the Father _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was brought")] a voice such as this was brought to him by the Majestic Glory, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

###### v18
And _we_ ourselves heard this voice brought from heaven _when we_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as temporal] were with him on the holy mountain,

###### v19
and we possess _as_ more reliable the prophetic word, to which you do well _if you_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("pay attention to") which is understood as conditional] pay attention to _it_ as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,

###### v20
recognizing this above all, that every prophecy of scripture does not come about from one's own interpretation,

###### v21
for no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men carried along by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
