###### v1
But there were also false prophets among the people, as there will be false teachers among you also, who will bring in _destructive heresies_ ^[Literally "heresies of destruction"], even denying the Master who bought them, _thus_ ^[Here "_thus_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("bringing on") which is understood as result] bringing on themselves swift destruction.

###### v2
And many will follow their licentious ways, because of whom the way of truth will be reviled.

And in greediness they will exploit you with false words, whose condemnation _from_ long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.

###### v4
For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but held _them_ captive in Tartarus with chains of darkness _and_ handed _them_ over to be kept for judgment,

###### v5
and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a proclaimer of righteousness, _and seven others_ ^[Literally "eighth"] _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("brought") which is understood as temporal] brought a flood on the world of the ungodly,

and especially those who go after the flesh in defiling lust ^[Literally "in lust of defilement," translated here as an attributive genitive] and who despise authority.

###### v11
whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not bring against them a demeaning judgment. ^[Some manuscripts have "a demeaning judgment from the Lord"]

###### v12
But these persons, like irrational animals born _only with_ natural _instincts_ for capture and killing, blaspheming _about things_ ^[Literally "with reference to which"] they do not understand, in their destruction will also be destroyed,

being harmed _as the_ wages of unrighteousness. Considering reveling in the daytime a pleasure, _they are_ stains and blemishes, carousing in their deceitful pleasures _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("feast together") which is understood as temporal] feast together with you,

###### v14
having eyes full of _desire for_ an adulteress and unceasing from sin, enticing unstable persons, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied in keeping with English style] having hearts trained for greediness. Accursed children!

_By_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("leaving") which is understood as means] leaving the straight path, they have gone astray, _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("followed") which is understood as causal] followed the way of Balaam the _son of_ Bosor, ^[Although some English versions use "Beor" here, this is due to harmonization with the Old Testament; the vast majority of Greek manuscripts read "Bosor" here] who loved the wages of unrighteousness,

These _people_ are waterless springs and mists driven by a hurricane, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved.

###### v19
promising them freedom _although they_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as concessive] themselves are slaves of depravity. For to whatever someone succumbs, by this he is also ^[Some manuscripts omit "also"] enslaved.

###### v20
For if, _after they_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have escaped from") which is understood as temporal] have escaped from the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord ^[Some manuscripts have "of our Lord"] and Savior Jesus Christ, and they are again entangled in these _things_ _and_ succumb to _them_, the last _state_ has become worse for them than the first.

###### v21
For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known _it_, to turn back from the holy commandment that had been delivered to them.

###### v22
