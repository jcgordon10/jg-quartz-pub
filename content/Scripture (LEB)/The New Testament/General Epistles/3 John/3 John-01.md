###### v1
The elder, to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in _the_ truth.

###### v2
Dear friend, I pray you may prosper concerning everything and be healthy, just as your soul prospers.

###### v3
For I rejoiced exceedingly _when the_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came") which is understood as temporal] brothers came and testified _to_ your truth, just as you are walking in _the_ truth.

###### v4
I have no greater joy than this: that I hear my children are walking in the truth.

###### v5
Dear friend, you act faithfully ^[Or "you act loyally"] _in_ whatever you do for the brothers, _even though they are strangers_ ^[Literally "and this strangers"].

###### v6
They have testified _to_ your love before the church; you will do well to send them ^[Literally "whom"] on their way in a manner worthy of God.

###### v7
For they have gone out on behalf of the name, accepting nothing from the pagans. ^[That is, Gentile unbelievers (as opposed to Gentile Christians)]

###### v8
Therefore we ought to support such _people_, so that we become fellow workers with _the_ truth.

###### v9
I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who wants to be first _among_ them, does not acknowledge us.

###### v10
Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to _the deeds he is doing_ ^[Literally "his deeds which he is doing"], disparaging us with evil words. And not being content with these, he does not receive the brothers himself, and he hinders those wanting _to do so_ and throws _them_ out of the church.

###### v11
Dear friend, do not imitate _what is_ evil, but _what is_ good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.

###### v12
Demetrius has been testified to by all, even by the truth itself. And we also testify _to him_, and you know that our testimony is true.

###### v13
I have many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you by means of ink and pen.

###### v14
But I hope to see you right away, and to speak _face to face_ ^[Literally "mouth to mouth"].

###### v15
Peace _be_ to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
