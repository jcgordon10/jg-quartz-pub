###### v1
Because of this, _it is_ all the more necessary _that_ we pay attention to the _things_ we have heard, lest we drift away.

###### v2
For if the word spoken through angels was binding and every transgression and act of disobedience received a just penalty,

###### v3
how will we escape _if we_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("neglect") which is understood as conditional] neglect so great a salvation which had _its_ beginning _when it_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal infinitive ("was spoken")] was spoken through the Lord _and_ was confirmed to us by those who heard,

###### v4
_while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was testifying at the same time")] God was testifying at the same time by signs and wonders and various miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will.

###### v5
For he did not subject to angels the world to come, about which we are speaking.

###### v6
But someone testified somewhere, saying,
"What is man, that you remember him,
or the son of man, that you care for him?

###### v7
You made him for a short _time_ lower than the angels;
you crowned him with glory and honor; ^[Several important manuscripts add "and placed him over the works of your hands" to the end of v. [[Heb-02#v7|7]]]

###### v8
    you subjected all _things_ under his feet. ^[A quotation from [[Ps-08#v4|Ps 8:4–6]][[Ps-08#v5|]][[Ps-08#v6|]]]
For in subjecting all _things_, ^[Some manuscripts have "subjecting all things to him"] he left nothing _that was_ not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all _things_ subjected to him,

###### v9
but we see Jesus, for a short _time_ made lower than the angels, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that apart from God ^[Some manuscripts have "so that by the grace of God"] he might taste death on behalf of everyone.

###### v10
For it was fitting for him for whom _are_ all _things_ and through whom _are_ all _things_ in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings.

###### v11
For both the one who sanctifies and the ones who are sanctified _are_ all from one, for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,

###### v12
saying,
"I will proclaim your name to my brothers;
in the midst of the assembly I will sing in praise of you." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-22#v22|Ps 22:22]]]

###### v13
And again,
"I will trust in him." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-08#v17|Isa 8:17]]]
And again,
"Behold, I and the children God has given me." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-08#v18|Isa 8:18]]]

###### v14
Therefore, since the children share in blood and flesh, he also in like manner shared in these _same things_, in order that through death he could destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,

###### v15
and could set free these who through fear of death were subject to slavery throughout all their lives.

###### v16
For surely he is not concerned with angels, but he is concerned with the descendants of Abraham.

###### v17
Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in all _respects_, in order that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things relating to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people.

###### v18
For in that which he himself suffered _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was tempted") which is understood as temporal] was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
