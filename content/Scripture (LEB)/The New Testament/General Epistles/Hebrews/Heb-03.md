###### v1
Therefore, holy brothers, sharers in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,

###### v2
who was faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses also _was_ in his household. ^[Some manuscripts have "in all his household"]

###### v3
For this one is considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, inasmuch as the one who builds it has greater honor than the house.

###### v4
For every house is built by someone, but the one who built all _things_ _is_ God.

###### v5
And Moses _was_ faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony to the things that would be spoken,

###### v6
but Christ _was faithful_ ^[The words "_was faithful_" are not in the Greek text, but are an understood repetition from the previous verse and v. [[Heb-03#v2|2]]] as a son over his house, whose house we are, if ^[Some manuscripts have "if indeed"] we hold fast to our confidence and the hope we can be proud of.

###### v7
Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,
"Today, if you hear his voice,

###### v8
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,
in the day of testing in the wilderness,

###### v9
where your fathers tested _me_ by trial
and saw my works

###### v10
_for_ forty years.
Therefore I was angry with this generation,
and I said, 'They always go astray in their heart,
and they do not know my ways.'

###### v11
    As I swore in my anger,
'_They will never enter_ ^[Literally "if they will enter"] into my rest.'" ^[A quotation from [[Ps-95#v7|Ps 95:7b-11]][[Ps-95#v8|]][[Ps-95#v9|]][[Ps-95#v10|]][[Ps-95#v11|]]]

###### v12
Watch out, brothers, lest there be in some of you an evil, unbelieving heart, _with the result that you_ fall away ^[Here "_with the result that_" is supplied as a component of the infinitive ("fall away") which is understood as result] from the living God.

###### v13
But encourage one another _day by day_ ^[Literally "by each day"], as long as it is called "today," so that _none of you become hardened_ ^[Literally "not anyone of you be hardened"] by the deception of sin.

###### v14
For we have become partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of _our_ commitment steadfast until the end,

###### v15
_while it is said_ ^[Literally "in the saying"],
"Today, if you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-95#v7|Ps 95:7b-8]][[Ps-95#v8|]]]

###### v16
For who, _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard _it_, were disobedient? Surely _it was_ not all who went out from Egypt through Moses?

###### v17
And with whom was he angry _for_ forty years? _Was it_ not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?

###### v18
And to whom did he swear _they would_ not enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient?

###### v19
And _so_ we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
