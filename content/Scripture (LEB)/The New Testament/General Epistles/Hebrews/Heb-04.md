###### v1
Therefore let us fear, _while there_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("remains") which is understood as temporal] remains a promise of entering into his rest, that none of you appear to fall short of _it_.

###### v2
_For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us_ ^[Literally "for we are also having had the good news proclaimed"], just as those also _did_, but the message _they heard_ ^[Literally "of hearing"] did not benefit them, _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("united") which is understood as causal] were not united with those who heard _it_ in faith.

###### v3
For we who have believed enter into rest, ^[Some manuscripts have "that rest"] just as he has said,
"As I swore in my anger,
'_They will never enter_ ^[Literally "if they will enter"] into my rest.'" ^[A quotation from [[Ps-95#v11|Ps 95:11]]]
And yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world.

###### v4
For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh _day_ in this way: "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works," ^[A quotation from [[Gen-02#v2|Gen 2:2]]]

###### v5
and in this _passage_ again, '_They will never enter_ ^[Literally "if they will enter"] into my rest.'" ^[A quotation from [[Ps-95#v11|Ps 95:11]]]

###### v6
Since therefore it remains _for_ some to enter into it, and the ones to whom the good news was proclaimed previously did not enter because of disobedience,

###### v7
again he ordains a certain day, today, speaking by David after so long a time, just as had been said before,
"Today, if you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-95#v7|Ps 95:7b-8]][[Ps-95#v8|]] (see also [[Heb-03#v7|Heb 3:7–8]][[Heb-03#v8|]], [[Heb-03#v15|15]])]

###### v8
For if Joshua had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken about another day after these _things_.

###### v9
Consequently a sabbath rest remains for the people of God.

###### v10
For the one who has entered into his rest has also himself rested from his works, just as God _did_ from his own _works_.

###### v11
Therefore, let us make every effort to enter into that rest, in order that no one may fall in the same pattern of disobedience.

###### v12
For the word of God _is_ living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow, and able to judge the reflections and thoughts of the heart.

###### v13
And no creature is hidden in the sight of him, but all _things are_ naked and laid bare to the eyes of him to whom _we must give our account_ ^[Literally "our account"].

###### v14
Therefore, _because we_ have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.

###### v15
For we do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but who has been tempted in all _things_ in the same way, without sin.

###### v16
Therefore let us approach with confidence to the throne of grace, in order that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
