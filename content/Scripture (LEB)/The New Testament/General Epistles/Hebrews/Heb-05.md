###### v1
For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of people in the things relating to God, in order that he can offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins,

###### v2
being able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and led astray, since he himself also is surrounded by weakness,

###### v3
and because of it he is obligated to offer _sacrifices_ for sins _for himself also, as well as for the people_ ^[Literally "as for the people so also for himself"].

###### v4
And someone does not take for himself the honor, but is called by God, just as Aaron also _was_.

###### v5
Thus also Christ did not glorify himself to become high priest, but the one who said to him,
"You are my Son, today I have begotten you," ^[A quotation from [[Ps-02#v7|Ps 2:7]]]

###### v6
just as also in another _place_ he says,
"You _are_ a priest _forever_ ^[Literally "for the age"] according to the order of Melchizedek," ^[A quotation from [[Ps-110#v4|Ps 110:4]]]

###### v7
who in the days of his flesh offered up both prayers and supplications, with loud crying and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard as a result of his reverence.

###### v8
Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered,

###### v9
and being perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him,

###### v10
being designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.

###### v11
Concerning this ^[Literally "which"] _we have much to say and it is difficult to explain_ ^[Literally "great for us the message and hard to explain to say"], since you have become sluggish in hearing.

###### v12
For indeed, _although you_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("ought") which is understood as concessive] ought to be teachers _by this time_ ^[Literally "because of the time"], you have need of someone to teach you again the beginning elements of the oracles of God, and _you have need of_ ^[Literally "you are having need of"] milk, not ^[Some manuscripts have "and not"] solid food.

###### v13
For everyone who partakes of milk _is_ unacquainted with the message of righteousness, because he is an infant.

###### v14
But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have trained their faculties for the distinguishing of both good and evil.
