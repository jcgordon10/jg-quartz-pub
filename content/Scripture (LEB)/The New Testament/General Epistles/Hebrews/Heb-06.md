###### v1
Therefore, leaving behind the elementary message about Christ, let us move on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,

###### v2
teaching about baptisms and laying on of hands, and resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.

###### v3
And this we will do, if God permits.

###### v4
For _it is_ impossible _concerning_ those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and become sharers of the Holy Spirit,

###### v5
and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age,

###### v6
and having fallen away, to renew _them_ again to repentance, _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have crucified again") which is understood as causal] have crucified again for themselves the Son of God and held him up to contempt.

###### v7
For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth vegetation usable to those _people_ _for whose sake_ ^[Literally "for the sake of whom"] _it is_ also cultivated, shares a blessing from God.

###### v8
But _if it_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("produces") which is understood as conditional] produces thorns and thistles, _it is_ worthless and near to a curse, whose end _is_ for burning.

###### v9
But even if we are speaking in this way, dear friends, we are convinced of better _things_ concerning you, and belonging to salvation.

###### v10
For God _is_ not unjust, _so as_ to forget your work and the love which you demonstrated for his name _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("having served") which is understood as means] having served the saints, and continuing to serve _them_.

###### v11
And we desire each one of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of _your_ hope until the end,

###### v12
in order that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and patience.

###### v13
For _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal participle ("made a promise")] God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater to swear by, he swore by himself,

###### v14
saying,
"Surely _I will greatly bless_ ^[Literally "blessing I will bless"] you, and _I will greatly multiply_ ^[Literally "multiplying I will multiply"] you."

###### v15
And so, _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("persevering") which is understood as means] persevering, he obtained the promise.

###### v16
For people swear by what is greater _than themselves_, and the oath for confirmation _is the_ end of all dispute for them.

###### v17
In the same way God, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("wanted") which is understood as causal] wanted to show even more to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his resolve, guaranteed _it_ with an oath,

###### v18
in order that through two unchangeable things, in which _it is_ impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge may have powerful encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before _us_,

###### v19
which we have like an anchor of the soul, both firm and steadfast, and entering into the inside of the curtain,

###### v20
where Jesus, the forerunner for us, entered, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("became") which is understood as causal] became a high priest _forever_ ^[Literally "to the age"] according to the order of Melchizedek.
