###### v1
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham _as he_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was returning") which is understood as temporal] was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, ^[This verse contains a number of quotations from [[Gen-14#v17|Gen 14:17–19]][[Gen-14#v18|]][[Gen-14#v19|]]]

###### v2
to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything ^[A quotation from [[Gen-14#v20|Gen 14:20]]]--in the first place, _his name_ is translated "king of righteousness," and then also "king of Salem," that is, "king of peace";

###### v3
without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God--he remains a priest for all time.

###### v4
But see how great this man _was_, to whom Abraham ^[Some manuscripts have "even Abraham"] the patriarch gave a tenth from the spoils!

###### v5
And indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a commandment to collect a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, although _they are descended from Abraham_ ^[Literally "coming forth from the loins of Abraham"].

###### v6
But the one who did not trace _his_ descent from them collected tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.

###### v7
Now without any dispute the inferior is blessed by the more prominent.

###### v8
And in this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case it is testified that he lives.

###### v9
And, _so to speak_ ^[Literally "as if to say a word"], even Levi, the one who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham.

###### v10
For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.

###### v11
Thus if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, what further need _is there_ for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the order of Aaron?

###### v12
For _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("changes")] the priesthood changes, of necessity there is a change of the law also.

###### v13
For the one about whom these _things_ are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar.

###### v14
For _it is_ evident that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, a tribe _with reference_ to which Moses said nothing concerning priests.

###### v15
And it is still more clear, if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises,

###### v16
who has become _a priest_ not according to a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.

###### v17
For it is testified,
"You _are_ a priest _forever_ ^[Literally "for the age"] according to the order of Melchizedek." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-110#v4|Ps 110:4]] (see also [[Heb-05#v6|Heb 5:6]]; [[Heb-06#v20|6:20]])]

###### v18
For on the one hand a preceding commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness

###### v19
(for the law _made_ nothing perfect), but on the other hand _there is_ the introduction of a better hope through which we draw near to God.

###### v20
And by as much as _this was_ not without an oath (for these on the one hand _have become priests_ ^[Literally "are having become priests"] without an oath,

###### v21
but he with an oath by the one who said to him,
"The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind,
'You _are_ a priest _forever_ ^[Literally "for the age"]'" ^[A quotation from [[Ps-110#v4|Ps 110:4]] (see also [[Heb-05#v6|Heb 5:6]]; [[Heb-06#v20|6:20]]; [[Heb-07#v17|7:17]])]),

###### v22
by so much more ^[Some manuscripts have "so much more also"] Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.

###### v23
And indeed many _have become_ ^[Literally "are having become"] priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing _in office_,

###### v24
but he, because he continues _forever_ ^[Literally "for the age"], holds the priesthood permanently.

###### v25
Therefore also he is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("lives") which is understood as causal] always lives in order to intercede on their behalf.

###### v26
For a high priest such as this indeed is fitting for us, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and having become exalted _above_ the heavens,

###### v27
who does not _need every day_ ^[Literally "have necessity every day"] like the former high priests to offer up sacrifices for his own sins _and_ then for the _sins_ of the people, because he did this once for all _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal participle ("offered up")] offered up himself.

###### v28
For the law appoints men _as_ high priests who have weakness, but the statement of the oath, after the law, _appoints_ a Son, who is made perfect _forever_ ^[Literally "for the age"].
