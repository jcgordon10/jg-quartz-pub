[[Heb-08|Previous Chapter]] | [[Heb-10|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Now ^[Some manuscripts have "Now even"] the first _covenant_ had regulations for worship and the earthly sanctuary.

###### v2
For a tent was prepared, the first _one_, in which _were_ the lampstand and the table and the presentation of the loaves, which is called the holy place.

###### v3
And after the second curtain _was_ a tent called the holy of holies,

###### v4
containing the golden incense altar and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which _were_ a golden jar containing the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded and the tablets of the covenant.

###### v5
And above it _were_ the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, about which it is not now _possible_ to speak in detail.

###### v6
Now these things having been prepared in this way, the priests enter into the first tent _continually_ ^[Literally "throughout all"] _as they_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal participle ("accomplish")] accomplish their service,

###### v7
but only the high priest _enters_ into the second _tent_ once a year, not without blood, which he offers on behalf of himself and the _sins_ of the people committed in ignorance.

###### v8
The Holy Spirit _was_ making this clear, _that_ the way _into_ the holy place _was_ not yet revealed, _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal participle ("was")] the first tent was still in existence,

###### v9
which _was_ a symbol for the present time, in which both the gifts and sacrifices which were offered were not able to perfect the worshiper with respect to the conscience,

###### v10
concerning _instead_ only food and drink and different washings, regulations of outward things imposed until the time of setting _things_ right.

###### v11
But Christ has arrived _as_ a high priest of the good _things_ to come. Through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands, that is, not of this creation,

###### v12
and not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered once for all into the _most_ holy place, obtaining eternal redemption.

###### v13
For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled sanctify _them_ for the ritual purity of the flesh,

###### v14
how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve _the_ living God?

###### v15
And because of this, he is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that, _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("has taken place") which is understood as causal] a death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions _committed_ during the first covenant, those who are the called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.

###### v16
For where _there is_ a will, _it is_ a necessity _for_ the death of the one who made the will to be established.

###### v17
For a will _is_ in force concerning those who are dead, since _it is_ never in force when the one who made the will is alive.

###### v18
Therefore not even the first _covenant_ was ratified without blood.

###### v19
For _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal participle ("had been spoken")] every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, _he_ took the blood of calves ^[Some manuscripts have "calves and goats"] with water and scarlet wool and hyssop _and_ sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people,

###### v20
saying,
"This _is_ the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you." ^[A quotation from [[Exod-24#v8|Exod 24:8]]]

###### v21
And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the utensils of service with the blood.

###### v22
Indeed, nearly everything is purified with blood according to the law, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.

###### v23
Therefore _it was_ necessary _for_ the sketches of the _things_ in heaven to be purified with these _sacrifices_, but the heavenly _things_ themselves _to be purified_ with better sacrifices than these.

###### v24
For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands, a _mere_ copy of the true _one_, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf,

###### v25
and not in order that he can offer himself many times, as the high priest enters into the sanctuary _year by year_ ^[Literally "according to year"] with blood not his own,

###### v26
since it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times from the foundation of the world, but now he has appeared once at the end of the ages for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself.

###### v27
And _just as_ ^[Literally "in as much as"] it is destined for people to die once, and after this, judgment,

###### v28
thus also Christ, having been offered once in order to bear the sins of many, will appear for the second time without reference to sin to those who eagerly await him for salvation.
