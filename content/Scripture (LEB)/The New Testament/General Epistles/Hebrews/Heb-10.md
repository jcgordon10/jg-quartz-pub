###### v10
by which will we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

###### v11
And every priest stands every day serving and offering the same sacrifices many times, which are never able to take away sins.

"Their sins and their lawless deeds I will never remember again." ^[A quotation from [[Jer-31#v34|Jer 31:34]]]

###### v21
and _since we have_ ^[These words are an implied repetition from v. [[Heb-10#v19|19]] for clarity] a great priest over the house of God,

###### v25
not abandoning _our meeting together_ ^[Literally "the meeting of ourselves"], as _is_ the habit of some, but encouraging _each other_, and by so much more as you see the day drawing near.

###### v26
For _if_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the conditional genitive absolute participle ("keep on sinning")] we keep on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
