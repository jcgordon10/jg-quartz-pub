###### v1
Therefore, _since_ ^[Here "_since_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as causal] we also have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us, putting aside every weight and _the sin that so easily ensnares us_ ^[Literally "the easily ensnaring sin"], let us run with patient endurance the race that has been set before us,

###### v2
fixing our eyes on Jesus, the originator and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

###### v3
For consider the one who endured such hostility by sinners against himself, ^[*The plural reflexive pronoun can still be translated as singular; see Louw-Nida 92.25] so that you will not grow weary in your souls _and_ give up.

###### v4
You have not yet resisted to the point of _shedding your_ ^[The words "shedding your" are not in the Greek text but are supplied for clarity] blood _as you_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal participle ("struggle")] struggle against sin.

###### v5
And have you completely forgotten the exhortation which instructs you as sons?
"My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline,
or give up _when you_ are corrected by him.

###### v6
For the Lord disciplines the one whom he loves,
and punishes every son whom he accepts." ^[A quotation from [[Prov-03#v11|Prov 3:11–12]][[Prov-03#v12|]]]

###### v7
Endure _it_ for discipline. God is dealing with you as sons. For what son _is there_ whom a father does not discipline?

###### v8
But if you are without discipline, in which all _legitimate sons_ ^[The phrase "legitimate sons" is not in the Greek text but is implied] have become participants, then you are illegitimate and not sons.

###### v9
Furthermore, we have had _our earthly fathers_ ^[Literally "the flesh of our fathers"] who disciplined _us_, and we respected _them_. Will we not much rather subject ourselves to the Father of spirits and live?

###### v10
For they disciplined _us_ for a few days according to what seemed _appropriate_ to them, but he _does so_ for our benefit, in order that _we_ can have a share in his holiness.

###### v11
Now all discipline seems for the moment not to be joyful but painful, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who are trained by it.

###### v12
Therefore strengthen your slackened hands and your weakened knees,

###### v13
and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame will not be dislocated, but rather be healed.

###### v14
Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.

###### v15
Take care _that_ no one falls short of the grace of God; _that_ no one growing up _like_ a root of bitterness causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;

###### v16
_that_ no one _be_ a sexually immoral or totally worldly _person_ like Esau, who for one meal traded his own birthright.

###### v17
For you know that also afterwards, _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal participle ("wanted")] wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, because he did not find an occasion for repentance, although he sought it with tears.

###### v18
For you have not come to something that can be touched, and to a burning fire, and to darkness, and to gloom, and to a whirlwind,

###### v19
and to the noise of a trumpet, and to the sound of words which those who heard begged _that_ not _another_ word be spoken to them.

###### v20
For they could not endure what was commanded: "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned." ^[A quotation from [[Exod-19#v12|Exod 19:12–13]][[Exod-19#v13|]]]

###### v21
And the spectacle was so terrifying _that_ Moses said, "I am terrified and trembling." ^[A quotation from [[Deut-09#v19|Deut 9:19]]]

###### v22
But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to tens of thousands of angels, to the festal gathering

###### v23
and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous _people_ made perfect,

###### v24
and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and _to the sprinkled blood_ ^[Literally "to the blood of sprinkling"] that speaks better than Abel's _does_.

###### v25
Watch out that you do not refuse the one who is speaking! For if those did not escape _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal participle ("refused")] refused the one who warned _them_ on earth, much less _will_ we _escape_, ^[*Here the verb "will … escape" is an understood repetition from the previous clause] _if we_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("reject") which is understood as conditional] reject the _one who warns_ from heaven,

###### v26
whose voice shook the earth at that time, but now he has promised, saying,
"Yet once _more_ I will shake not only the earth but also heaven." ^[A quotation from [[Hag-02#v6|Hag 2:6]]]

###### v27
Now the _phrase_ "yet once _more_" indicates the removal of what is shaken, namely, things that have been created, in order that the things that are not shaken may remain.

###### v28
Therefore, _since we_ ^[Here "_since_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are receiving") which is understood as causal] are receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us be thankful, through which let us serve God acceptably, with awe and reverence.

###### v29
For indeed our God _is_ a consuming fire.
