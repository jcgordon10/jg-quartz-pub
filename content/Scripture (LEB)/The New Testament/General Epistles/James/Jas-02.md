###### v1
My brothers, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality.

###### v2
For if someone ^[Literally "a man," but clearly in a generic sense here meaning "someone, a person"] enters into your assembly ^[Literally "synagogue," but here probably referring to a Christian assembly] in fine clothing with a gold ring on his finger, and a poor person in filthy clothing also enters,

###### v3
and you look favorably on the one wearing the fine clothing and you say, "Be seated here in a good place," and to the poor person you say, "You stand or be seated there ^[Some manuscripts have "you stand there or be seated"] by my footstool,"

###### v4
have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?

###### v5
Listen, my dear brothers! Did not God choose the poor of the world _to be_ rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him?

###### v6
But you have dishonored the poor! Are not the rich exploiting you and they themselves dragging you into the courts?

###### v7
Do they themselves not blaspheme the good name _of the one to whom you belong_ ^[Literally "that was called over you"]?

###### v8
However, if you carry out the royal law according to the scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," ^[A quotation from [[Lev-19#v18|Lev 19:18]]] you are doing well.

###### v9
But if you show partiality, you commit sin, _and thus_ ^[Here "_and thus_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are convicted") which is understood as result] are convicted by the law as transgressors.

###### v10
For whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles in one _point only_ has become guilty of all _of it_.

###### v11
For the one who said "Do not commit adultery" ^[A quotation from [[Exod-20#v14|Exod 20:14]]; [[Deut-05#v18|Deut 5:18]]] also said "Do not murder." ^[A quotation from [[Exod-20#v13|Exod 20:13]]; [[Deut-05#v17|Deut 5:17]]] Now if you do not commit adultery but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.

###### v12
Thus speak and thus act as those who are going to be judged by the law of liberty.

###### v13
For judgment _is_ merciless to the one who has not practiced mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.

###### v14
What _is_ the benefit, my brothers, if someone says _that he_ has faith but does not have works? That faith _is_ not able to save him, _is it_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here]

###### v15
If a brother or a sister is poorly clothed and lacking food for the day,

###### v16
and one of you should say to them, "Go in peace, keep warm and _eat well_ ^[Literally, "be satisfied"]," but does not give them what is necessary for the body, what _is_ the benefit?

###### v17
Thus also faith, if it does not have works, is dead by itself.

###### v18
But someone will say, "You have faith and I have works." ^[Some see the quotation by "someone" extending to the end of v. [[Jas-02#v18|18]], while others see it extending through v. [[Jas-02#v19|19]]] Show me your faith apart from your ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] works, and I will show you my ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] faith by my works.

###### v19
You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe, and shudder!

###### v20
But do you want to know, O foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?

###### v21
Was not Abraham our father justified by works _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("offered up") which is understood as temporal] offered up his son Isaac on the altar?

###### v22
You see that faith was working together with his works, and by the works the faith was perfected.

###### v23
And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness," ^[A quotation from [[Gen-15#v6|Gen 15:6]]] and he was called God's friend.

###### v24
You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.

###### v25
And likewise was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works _when she_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("welcomed") which is understood as temporal] welcomed the messengers and sent _them_ out by a different route?

###### v26
For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
