###### v1
Not many should become teachers, my brothers, _because you_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal] know that we will receive a greater judgment. ^[Or "greater condemnation"]

###### v2
For we all stumble _in_ many _ways_. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he _is_ a perfect individual, ^[Literally "man," but clearly in a generic sense here meaning "someone, a person"] able to hold in check his whole body also.

###### v3
And if we put bits in the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we also guide their whole bodies.

###### v4
Behold also ships: _although they_ are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot wishes.

###### v5
So also the tongue is a small member _of the body_ ^[The words "of the body" are not in the Greek text but are supplied for clarity] and boasts great _things_. Behold how small a fire sets ablaze how great a forest!

###### v6
And the tongue _is_ a fire! The world of unrighteousness, ^[Or "a fire, the world of unrighteousness! The tongue is set among our members"] the tongue, is set among our members, defiling the whole body and setting on fire _the course of human existence_ ^[Literally "the wheel of origin"], being set on fire by hell.

###### v7
For every species of animals and birds, of reptiles and sea creatures, is being tamed and has been tamed by the human species,

###### v8
but no human being is able to tame the tongue. _It is_ a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

###### v9
With it we bless the ^[Or possibly "our," if the Greek article is understood as a possessive pronoun] Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.

###### v10
From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these _things_ ought not to be so!

###### v11
A spring does not pour forth from the same opening fresh and bitter _water, does it_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here]

###### v12
A fig tree is not able, my brothers, to produce olives, or a grapevine figs. Neither can a saltwater spring produce fresh water.

###### v13
Who _is_ wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] good behavior his works, with the humility of wisdom.

###### v14
But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and tell lies against the truth.

###### v15
This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but _is_ earthly, unspiritual, demonic.

###### v16
For where _there is_ jealousy and selfish ambition, there _is_ disorder and every evil practice.

###### v17
But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, obedient, full of mercy and good fruits, nonjudgmental, without hypocrisy,

###### v18
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace among ^[Or "for"; or possibly "by"] those who make peace.
