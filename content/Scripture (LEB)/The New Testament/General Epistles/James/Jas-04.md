###### v1
From where _are_ conflicts and from where _are_ quarrels among you? _Is it_ not from this, from your pleasures that wage war among your members?

###### v2
You desire and do not have; you murder and are filled with envy, and are not able to obtain; you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.

###### v3
You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, in order that you may spend _it_ on your pleasures.

###### v4
Adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes _himself_ an enemy of God.

###### v5
Or do you think that in vain the scripture says, "The spirit which he caused to dwell in us desires jealously"? ^[This translation takes "spirit" to be the capacity within people that produces a divided mind and conflicts regarding God; other translations take this to refer to the Holy Spirit: "He (God) jealously desires the Spirit which he caused to dwell in us"]

###### v6
But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says,
"God opposes the proud,
but gives grace to the humble." ^[A quotation from [[Prov-03#v34|Prov 3:34]]]

###### v7
Therefore subject yourselves to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

###### v8
Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse _your_ hands, _you_ sinners, and purify _your_ hearts, _you_ double-minded!

###### v9
Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] joy to gloominess.

###### v10
Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.

###### v11
Do not speak evil of one another, brothers. The one who speaks evil of a brother or judges his brother speaks evil of the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge _of the law_. ^[The words "of the law" are not in the Greek text, but are an understood repetition from the previous clause]

###### v12
There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] neighbor?

###### v13
Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will travel to such and such a city and spend a year there, and carry on business and make a profit,"

###### v14
you who do not know _what will happen tomorrow_ ^[Literally "the _circumstance_ of tomorrow"], _what your life will be like_ ^[Literally "of what sort your life"]. For you are a smoky vapor that appears for a short time and then disappears.

###### v15
Instead you should say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that."

###### v16
But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.

###### v17
Therefore, to the one who knows to do good and does not do _it_, to him it is sin.
