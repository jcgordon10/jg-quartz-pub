###### v1
For _you_ yourselves know, brothers, our reception with you, that it was not in vain,

###### v2
but _after we_ had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, just as you know, we had the courage in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition.

###### v3
For our exhortation _is_ not from error or from impurity or with deceit,

###### v4
but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, thus we speak, not as pleasing people but God, who examines our hearts.

###### v5
_For never_ ^[Literally "for neither ever"] did we come with a word of flattery, just as you know, nor with a pretext of greediness (God _is_ witness),

###### v6
nor seeking glory from people, neither from you nor from others.

###### v7
_Although we could have insisted on our own importance_ ^[Literally "being able to be with a claim of importance"] ^[Here the participle ("being able") is understood as concessive] as apostles of Christ, yet we became infants in your midst, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children.

###### v8
Longing for you in this way, we determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls, because you had become dear to us.

###### v9
For you remember, brothers, our labor and hardship: working by night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.

###### v10
You _are_ witnesses, and _so is_ God, how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we became to you who believe,

###### v11
just as you know how _we treated_ each one of you, like a father his own children,

###### v12
exhorting and consoling you and insisting that you live in a manner worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory.

###### v13
And because of this we also give thanks to God constantly, that _when you_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("received") which is understood as temporal] received God's word _that you heard_ ^[Literally "of hearing"] from us, you accepted _it_ not _as the_ word of men, but as _it_ truly is, _the_ word of God, which also is at work in you who believe.

###### v14
For you became imitators, brothers, of the churches of God _which_ are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because you also suffered the same _things_ at the hands of your own people, just as _they_ themselves _did_ also at the hands of the Jews,

###### v15
who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and who persecuted us, and _who are_ not pleasing to God and _are_ opposed to all people,

###### v16
hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles in order that they may be saved, so that _they_ always fill up their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the end. ^[Or "has come upon them at last"]

###### v17
But _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were made orphans by separation") which is understood as temporal] we were made orphans by separation from you, brothers, for _a short time_ ^[Literally "the time of an hour"] (in face, not in heart), _we were_ even more eager with great desire to see your face,

###### v18
because we wanted to come to you--I, Paul, _on more than one occasion_ ^[Literally "both once and twice"]--and Satan hindered us.

###### v19
For who _is_ our hope or joy or crown of boasting? _Is it_ not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming?

###### v20
For you are our glory and joy.
