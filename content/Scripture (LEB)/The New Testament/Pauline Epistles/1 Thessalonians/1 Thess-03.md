###### v1
Therefore _when we_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("could bear") which is understood as temporal] could bear _it_ no longer, we determined to be left behind in Athens alone,

###### v2
and we sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, in order to strengthen and to encourage you about your faith,

###### v3
_so that_ no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For _you_ yourselves know that we are appointed for this,

###### v4
for indeed when we were with you we told you beforehand that we were about to be afflicted, just as indeed it happened, and you know.

###### v5
Because of this, I also, _when I_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("could endure") which is understood as temporal] could endure _it_ no longer, sent in order to know your faith, lest somehow the tempter tempted you and our labor should be in vain.

###### v6
But now, _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("has come") which is understood as causal] Timothy has come to us from you and has brought good news to us of your faith and love, and that _you always think kindly of us_ ^[Literally "that you have kindly remembrance of us always"], desiring to see us just as also we _desire to see_ you,

###### v7
because of this, brothers, we have been comforted because of you in all our distress and affliction through your faith,

###### v8
because now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.

###### v9
For what thanks can we repay to God concerning you, because of all the joy _with_ which we rejoice because of you before our God,

###### v10
night and day praying beyond all measure that _we_ may see your face and complete what is lacking in your faith?

###### v11
Now _may_ our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you,

###### v12
and _may_ the Lord _cause_ you to increase and to abound in love for one another and for all, just as also we _do_ for you,

###### v13
so that your hearts may be established blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints. ^[Some manuscripts have "his saints. Amen."]
