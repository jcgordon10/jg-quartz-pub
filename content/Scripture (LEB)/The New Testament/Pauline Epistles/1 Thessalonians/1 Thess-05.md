[[1 Thess-04|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need _of anything_ to be written to you,

###### v2
for _you_ yourselves well know that the day of the Lord is coming in the _same_ way as a thief in the night.

###### v3
Whenever they say "Peace and security," then sudden destruction will overtake them like the birth pains of _a pregnant woman_ ^[Literally "one who has in the belly"], and they will not possibly escape.

###### v4
But you, brothers, are not in the darkness, so that the day should catch you like a thief,

###### v5
for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.

###### v6
So then, we must not sleep like the rest, but must be on the alert and be self-controlled.

###### v7
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night.

###### v8
But _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as causal] we are of the day, we must be sober, _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("putting on") which is understood as means] putting on the breastplate of faith and love and _as_ a helmet the hope of salvation,

###### v9
because God did not appoint us for wrath, but for the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

###### v10
who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live at the same time with him.

###### v11
Therefore encourage one another and build up _each other_ ^[Literally "one the one," i.e., "one the other"], just as indeed you are doing.

###### v12
Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and rule over you in the Lord and admonish you,

###### v13
and to esteem them beyond all measure in love, because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.

###### v14
And we urge you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, console the discouraged, help the sick, be patient toward all _people_.

###### v15
See to it that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue good toward ^[Some manuscripts have "both toward"] one another and toward all _people_.

###### v16
Rejoice always,

###### v17
pray constantly,

###### v18
give thanks in everything; for this _is_ the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.

###### v19
Do not quench the Spirit.

###### v20
Do not despise prophecies,

###### v21
but examine all _things_; hold fast to _what is_ good.

###### v22
Abstain from every form of evil.

###### v23
Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete, blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

###### v24
The one who calls you _is_ faithful, who also will do _this_.

###### v25
Brothers, pray for us. ^[Some manuscripts have "pray for us also"]

###### v26
Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.

###### v27
I adjure you by the Lord, have this letter read aloud to all the brothers.

###### v28
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with you.
