[[1 Tim-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,

###### v2
to Timothy, _my_ true child in the faith. Grace, mercy, _and_ peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

###### v3
Just as I urged you _when I_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("traveled") which is understood as temporal] traveled to Macedonia, remain in Ephesus, so that you may instruct certain people not to teach other doctrine,

###### v4
and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause useless speculations rather than God's plan _that is_ by faith.

###### v5
But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a faith without hypocrisy,

###### v6
from which some have deviated, _and_ have turned away into fruitless discussion,

###### v7
wanting to be teachers of the law, _although they_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("understand") which is understood as concessive] do not understand either _the things_ which they are saying or _the things_ concerning which they are speaking confidently.

###### v8
But we know that the law _is_ good, if anyone makes use of it lawfully,

###### v9
knowing this, that the law _is_ not given for a righteous _person_ but for the lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and totally worldly, for the one who kills his father and the one who kills his mother, for murderers,

###### v10
sexually immoral people, homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and _whatever_ ^[Literally "if anything"] else is opposed to sound teaching,

###### v11
according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God that I was entrusted with.

###### v12
_I give thanks_ ^[Literally "I have thankfulness"] to the one who strengthens me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he considered me faithful, placing _me_ into ministry, ^[Or "service"]

###### v13
_although I_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as concessive] was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, but I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief,

###### v14
and the grace of our Lord abounded with the faith and love _that are_ in Christ Jesus.

###### v15
The saying _is_ trustworthy and worthy of all acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.

###### v16
But because of this I was shown mercy, in order that in me foremost, Christ Jesus might demonstrate his total patience, for an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life.

###### v17
Now to the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, to the only God, _be_ honor and glory _forever and ever_ ^[Literally "to the ages of the ages"]. Amen.

###### v18
I am setting before you this instruction, Timothy _my_ child, in accordance with the prophecies spoken long ago about you, in order that by them you may fight the good fight,

###### v19
having faith and a good conscience, which some, _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have rejected") which is understood as causal] have rejected _these_, have suffered shipwreck concerning their faith,

###### v20
among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, in order that they may be taught not to blaspheme.
