###### v1
Now I, Paul, appeal to you myself by the humility and gentleness of Christ, who _when I am present in person_ ^[Literally "to the face"] _am_ humble among you, but _when I_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("am absent") which is understood as temporal] am absent am bold toward you--

###### v2
now I ask _when I_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("am present") which is understood as temporal] am present _that I will_ not _need_ to be bold with the confidence _with_ which I propose to show boldness toward some who consider us as behaving according to the flesh.

###### v3
For _although we_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are living") which is understood as concessive] are living in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh,

###### v4
for the weapons of our warfare _are_ not merely human, but powerful to God for the tearing down of fortresses, tearing down arguments

###### v5
and all pride that is raised up against the knowledge of God, and taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.

###### v6
And _we are ready_ ^[Literally "having with ready"] to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is completed.

###### v7
You are looking at things according to appearance. If anyone is convinced he himself is Christ's, he should consider this concerning himself again: that just as Christ himself _is_, so also _are_ we.

###### v8
For even if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave _us_ _for building you up and not for tearing you down_ ^[Literally "for building up and not for tearing down of you"], I will not be put to shame,

###### v9
so that I do not want to appear as if I were terrifying you by my letters,

###### v10
because it is said, "His letters _are_ severe and powerful, but his bodily presence _is_ weak and his speech is of no account."

###### v11
Let such a person consider this: that what we are in word by letters _when we_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are absent") which is understood as temporal] are absent, _we will_ also _be_ in _actions_ ^[Literally "deed"] _when we_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are present") which is understood as temporal] are present.

###### v12
For we do not dare to classify or to compare ourselves with some who commend themselves, but _they_ themselves, _when they_ measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, do not understand.

###### v13
But we will not boast _beyond limits_ ^[Literally "to the things immeasurable"], but according to the measure of the assignment that God has assigned to us as a measure to reach even as far as you.

###### v14
For we are not overextending ourselves, as _if we_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("reached") which is understood as conditional] had not reached you, because we have reached even as far as you with the gospel of Christ,

###### v15
not boasting _beyond limits_ ^[Literally "to the things immeasurable"] in the labors of others, but having hope _that as_ your faith is growing to be enlarged greatly by you according to our assignment,

###### v16
so that we may proclaim the gospel in the regions that lie beyond you, _and_ not boast in the things accomplished in the _area_ assigned to someone else.

###### v17
But "the one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord." ^[A quotation from [[Jer-09#v24|Jer 9:24]]]

###### v18
For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but _the one_ whom the Lord commends.
