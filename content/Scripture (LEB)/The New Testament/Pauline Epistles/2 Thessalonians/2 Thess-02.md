[[2 Thess-01|Previous Chapter]] | [[2 Thess-03|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Now we ask you, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our assembling to him,

###### v2
that you not be easily shaken from your composure, nor be troubled either by a spirit or by a message or by a letter _alleged to be from us_ ^[Literally "as _if_ by us"], to the effect that the day of the Lord has arrived.

###### v3
Do not let anyone deceive you in any way, for _that day will not come_ unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,

###### v4
who opposes and who exalts himself over every so-called god or object of worship, so that he sits down in the temple of God, proclaiming that he himself is God.

###### v5
Do you not remember that _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as temporal] we were still with you, we were saying these _things_ to you?

###### v6
And you know that which restrains _him_ now, so that he will be revealed in his own time.

###### v7
For the mystery of lawlessness is at work already; only the one who now restrains ^[Or "restrains it" (referring to the "mystery of lawlessness"; or "restrains him" (referring to the "man of lawlessness" in v. [[2 Thess-02#v3|3]])] _will do so_ until he is out of the way, ^[Literally "out of the midst"]

###### v8
and then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of his mouth, and wipe out by the appearance of his coming,

###### v9
whose coming is in accordance with the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders,

###### v10
and with every unrighteous deception against those who are perishing, in place of which they did not accept the love of the truth, so that they would be saved.

###### v11
And because of this, God sends them _a powerful delusion_ ^[Literally "a working of deceit"] so that they will believe the lie,

###### v12
in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth, but delighted in unrighteousness.

###### v13
But we ought to give thanks to God always concerning you, brothers _dearly_ loved by the Lord, because God has chosen you _as_ first fruits for salvation by the sanctification of the Spirit and faith in the truth,

###### v14
for which _purpose_ he called ^[Some manuscripts have "he also called"] you through our gospel for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

###### v15
So then, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions which you were taught, whether by _spoken_ word or by letter from us.

###### v16
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given _us_ eternal encouragement and good hope by grace,

###### v17
encourage your hearts and strengthen _you_ in every good work and word.
