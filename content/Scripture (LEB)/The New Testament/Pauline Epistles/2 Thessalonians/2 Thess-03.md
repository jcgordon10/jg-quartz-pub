[[2 Thess-02|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may progress and be honored, just as also _it was_ with you,

###### v2
and that we may be delivered from evil and wicked people, _for not all have the faith_ ^[Literally "for not of all _is_ the faith"].

###### v3
But the Lord is faithful, who will strengthen you and guard _you_ from the evil one.

###### v4
And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are both doing and you will do _the things_ that we are commanding.

###### v5
Now may the Lord direct your hearts toward the love of God and toward the patient endurance of Christ.

###### v6
But we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, _that_ you keep away from every brother who lives irresponsibly and not according to the tradition that they received from us.

###### v7
For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate us, that we did not behave irresponsibly among you,

###### v8
nor did we eat bread from anyone without paying, but with toil and labor, _we were_ working night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you,

###### v9
not that we do not have the right, but so that we may give ourselves _as_ an example to you, so that _you_ may imitate us.

###### v10
For even when we were with you, we used to command this to you: that if anyone does not want to work, neither should he eat.

###### v11
For we hear _that_ some among you are living irresponsibly, working _at_ nothing, but being busybodies.

###### v12
Now we command and we exhort such people in the Lord Jesus Christ that, working with quietness, they eat their own bread.

###### v13
But _as for_ you, brothers, do not be discouraged _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("doing what is right") which is understood as temporal] doing what is right.

###### v14
But if anyone does not obey our message through this letter, take note not to associate with him, in order that he may be put to shame.

###### v15
And do not consider _him_ as an enemy, but admonish _him_ as a brother.

###### v16
Now may the Lord of peace himself grant you peace through everything in every way. _May_ the Lord _be_ with all of you.

###### v17
The greeting _is_ by my hand, Paul's, which is _a sign of genuineness_ ^[Literally "a sign"] in every letter: _this is how I write_ ^[Literally "in this way I write"].

###### v18
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with all of you.
