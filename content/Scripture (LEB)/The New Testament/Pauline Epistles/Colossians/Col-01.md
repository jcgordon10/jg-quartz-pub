because of the hope reserved for you in heaven, which you have heard about beforehand in the word of truth, the gospel,

that has come to you, just as also in all the world it is bearing fruit and increasing, just as also among you from the day you heard about and understood the grace of God in truth,

just as you learned _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] from Epaphras, our dear fellow slave who is a faithful minister of Christ _on_ our behalf, ^[Some manuscripts have "on your behalf"]

_who_ also made clear to us your love in the Spirit.

###### v9
Because of this also we, from the day we heard about _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] did not cease praying for you, and asking that you may be filled _with_ the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual insight,

so that you may live in a manner worthy of the Lord, _to please _him_ in all respects_ ^[Literally "to all pleasing"], bearing fruit in every good deed and increasing in the knowledge of God,

enabled with all power, according to his glorious might, for all steadfastness and patience with joy,

who has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred _us_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to the kingdom of the Son _he loves_ ^[Literally "of his love"],

in whom we have the redemption, the forgiveness of sins,

###### v15
who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all ^[Translated as a genitive of subordination (Wallace, _GGBB_, 104)] creation,

###### v16
because all _things_ in the heavens and on the earth were created by him, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers, all _things_ were created through him and for him,

###### v17
and he himself is before all _things_, and in him all _things_ are held together,

###### v18
and he himself is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he himself may become first in everything,

###### v19
because he was well pleased _for_ all the fullness to dwell in him,

###### v20
and through him to reconcile all _things_ to himself, _by_ ^[Here "by" is supplied as a component of the participle ("making peace") which is understood as means] making peace through the blood of his cross, through him, whether things on earth or things in heaven.

###### v21
And _although you were formerly alienated_ ^[Literally "and you formerly being alienated"] ^[Here the participle ("being") is understood as concessive] and enemies in attitude, because of your evil deeds,

###### v22
but now you have been reconciled ^[Some manuscripts have "he has reconciled _you_"] by _his physical body_ ^[Literally "the body of his flesh"] through death, to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him,

###### v23
if indeed you remain in the faith, established and steadfast and not shifted away from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister.

###### v24
Now I rejoice in my sufferings on behalf of you, and I fill up in my flesh what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ, on behalf of his body which is the church,

###### v25
of which I became a minister, according to God's stewardship which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God,

###### v26
the mystery _which_ has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but has now been revealed to his saints,

###### v27
to whom God wanted to make known what _is_ the glorious wealth of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory,

###### v28
whom we proclaim, _by_ ^[Here "by" is supplied as a component of the participle ("admonishing") which is understood as means] admonishing every person ^[Literally "man," used here in a generic sense to refer to persons of either gender] and teaching every person ^[Literally "man," used here in a generic sense to refer to persons of either gender] with all wisdom, in order that we may present every person ^[Literally "man," used here in a generic sense to refer to persons of either gender] mature in Christ,
