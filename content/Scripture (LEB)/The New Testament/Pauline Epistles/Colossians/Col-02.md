###### v1
For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on behalf of you, and those in Laodicea, and all those who have not seen my face _in person_ ^[Literally "in the flesh"],

###### v2
so that their hearts may be encouraged, united in love and into all the wealth of the full assurance of insight into the knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ,

###### v3
in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.

###### v4
I say this in order that no one will deceive you with persuasive speech,

###### v5
for even if I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing and seeing your good order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.

###### v6
Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, live in him,

###### v7
firmly rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding with thankfulness.

###### v8
Beware lest _anyone take you captive_ ^[Literally "anyone be the one who takes captive you"] through philosophy and empty deceit, according to _human tradition_ ^[Literally "the tradition of men"], according to the elemental spirits of the world and not according to Christ,

###### v9
because in him all the fullness of deity dwells bodily,

###### v10
and you are filled in him, who is the head over every ruler and authority,

###### v11
in whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made by hands, by the removal of the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,

###### v12
having been buried with him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with _him_ through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.

###### v13
And _although you were dead_ ^[Literally "and you being dead"] ^[Here the participle ("being") is understood as concessive] in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,

###### v14
having destroyed the certificate of indebtedness in ordinances against us, which was hostile to us, and removed it out of the way _by_ ^[Here "by" is supplied as a component of the participle ("nailing") which is understood as means] nailing it to the cross.

###### v15
_When he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had disarmed") which is understood as temporal] had disarmed the rulers and the authorities, he made a display of _them_ in public, triumphing over them by it. ^[Or "in him"]

###### v16
Therefore do not let anyone judge you with reference to eating or ^[Some manuscripts have "and"] drinking or participation in a feast or a new moon or a Sabbath,

###### v17
which are a shadow of what is to come, but the reality _is_ Christ.

###### v18
Let no one condemn you, taking pleasure in humility and the worship of angels, going into detail _about_ _the things_ which he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,

###### v19
and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by the ligaments and sinews, grows with the growth of God.

###### v20
If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world, why do you submit _to them_ as _if_ living in the world?

###### v21
"Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch,"

###### v22
which _things_ are all _meant_ for destruction by consuming according to human commandments and teachings,

###### v23
which _things_ _although they have_ ^[Literally "having"], ^[*Here the participle ("having") is understood as concessive] to be sure, an appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and humility and unsparing treatment of the body, _do not have any value_ ^[Literally "are not with any value"] against the indulgence of the flesh.
