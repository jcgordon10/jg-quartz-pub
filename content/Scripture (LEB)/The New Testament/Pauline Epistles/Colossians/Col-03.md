###### v1
Therefore, if you have been raised together with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.

###### v2
Set your mind on the things above, not _on_ the things on earth.

###### v3
For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

###### v4
When Christ, _who is_ your life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.

###### v5
Therefore put to death _what is earthly in you_ ^[Literally "the members on the earth"]: sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustful passion, evil desire, and greediness, which is idolatry,

###### v6
because of which the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience,

###### v7
in which also you once lived, when you used to live in them. ^[Or "among them" (the pronoun may refer either to people or to sins)]

###### v8
But now you also lay aside all _these_ things: anger, rage, wickedness, slander, abusive language from your mouth.

###### v9
Do not lie to one another, _because you_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have taken off") which is understood as causal] have taken off the old man together with his deeds,

###### v10
and have put on the new _man_ that is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one who created him,

###### v11
where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, _or_ free, but Christ _is_ all, and in all.

###### v12
Therefore, as _the_ chosen of God, holy and _dearly_ loved, put on affection, compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience,

###### v13
putting up with one another and forgiving one another. If anyone should have a complaint against anyone, just as also the Lord forgave you, thus also you _do the same_.

###### v14
And to all these _things_ _add_ love, which is _the_ bond of perfection.

###### v15
And the peace of Christ must rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body, and be thankful.

###### v16
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another with all wisdom, with psalms, hymns, _and_ spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God,

###### v17
and everything _whatever_ ^[Literally "if anything that"] you do in word or in deed, giving thanks _for_ all _things_ in the name of the Lord Jesus to God the Father through him.

###### v18
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.

###### v19
Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them.

###### v20
Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing in the Lord.

###### v21
Fathers, do not provoke your children, so that they will not become discouraged.

###### v22
Slaves, obey your _human_ ^[Literally "according to the flesh"] masters in everything, not _while being watched_ ^[Literally "with eye-service"], as people pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.

###### v23
Whatever you do, accomplish _it_ from the soul, as to the Lord, and not to people,

###### v24
_because you_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal] know that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. Serve ^[Or "You serve"; the same Greek verb form can be understood as either imperative ("serve") or indicative ("you serve"), so that commentators and Bible translations differ] the Lord Christ.

###### v25
For the one who does wrong will receive back whatever wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.
