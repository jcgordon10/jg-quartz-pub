###### v1
Masters, grant your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you also have a master in heaven.

###### v2
Be devoted to prayer, keeping alert in it with thanksgiving,

###### v3
praying at the same time for us also, that God may open for us a door of the message, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which also _I am a prisoner_ ^[Literally "I have been bound"],

###### v4
so that I may reveal ^[Or "may make it clear"] it, as it is necessary for me to speak.

###### v5
Live with wisdom toward those outside, making the most of the time.

###### v6
Let your speech always _be_ with grace, seasoned with salt, so that _you_ may know how it is necessary for you to answer each one.

Tychicus, my dear brother and faithful servant and fellow slave in the Lord, will make known to you all _my circumstances_ ^[Literally "the things according to me"],

whom I have sent to you for this very _reason_, in order that you may know _our circumstances_ ^[Literally "the things concerning us"] and he may encourage your hearts,

together with Onesimus, my faithful and dear brother, who is _one_ of you. They will make known to you all _the circumstances_ ^[Literally "the things"] here.

###### v10
Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions--if he should come to you, welcome him),

###### v11
and Jesus who is called Justus. These _are_ the only ones who are fellow workers for the kingdom of God from the circumcision, who have been a comfort to me.

###### v12
Epaphras, who is _one_ of you, greets you, a slave of Christ ^[Some manuscripts have "of Christ Jesus"] always struggling on behalf of you in his prayers, that you may stand mature and fully assured ^[Or "and filled"] in all the will of God.

###### v13
For I testify to him that _he is working hard_ ^[Literally "he has much labor"] on behalf of you and those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis.

###### v14
Luke the physician, our dear friend, greets you, _as does_ Demas.

###### v15
Greet the brothers in Laodicea, and Nympha and the church in her ^[Some manuscripts, including the majority of Byzantine minuscules, read the masculine form of the pronoun here ("his"), understanding the form of the name "Nympha" earlier in the verse to be masculine] house.

###### v16
And whenever this letter is read among you, _see to it_ ^[Literally "cause"] that it is read also among the Laodicean church, and that you also read the _letter_ from Laodicea.

###### v17
And tell Archippus, "Direct your attention to the ministry that you received in the Lord, in order that you may complete it."

###### v18
The greeting _is_ by my hand, Paul's. Remember my _imprisonment_ ^[Literally "bonds"]. Grace _be_ with you.
