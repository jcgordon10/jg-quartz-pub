[[Eph-01|Previous Chapter]] | [[Eph-03|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
And you, _although you were dead_ ^[Literally "and you being dead"] ^[Here the participle ("being") is understood as concessive] in your trespasses and sins,

###### v2
in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit now working in the sons of disobedience,

###### v3
among whom also we all formerly lived in the desires of our flesh, doing the will ^[Or "desires"] of the flesh and of the mind, and we were children of wrath ^[This phrase is a Semitic idiom which can mean either (1) "children characterized by wrath" or (2) "children destined for wrath"] by nature, as also the rest of _them_ were.

###### v4
But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love _with_ which he loved us,

###### v5
and we being dead in trespasses, he made _us_ alive together with Christ (by grace you are saved),

###### v6
and raised _us_ together and seated _us_ together in the heavenly _places_ in Christ Jesus,

###### v7
in order that he might show in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness upon us in Christ Jesus.

###### v8
For by grace you are saved through faith, and this _is_ not from yourselves, _it is_ the gift of God;

###### v9
_it is_ not from works, so that no one can boast.

###### v10
For we are his creation, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, so that we may walk in them.

###### v11
Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in _the_ flesh, the so-called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision in _the_ flesh, made by hands,

###### v12
that you were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, not having hope, and without God in the world.

###### v13
But now in Christ Jesus you, the ones who once were far away, have become near by the blood of Christ.

###### v14
For he himself is our peace, who made both one and broke down the dividing wall of the partition, the enmity, in his flesh,

###### v15
invalidating the law of commandments in ordinances, in order that he might create the two in himself into one new man, _thus_ ^[Here "_thus_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("making") which is understood as result] making peace,

###### v16
and might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, killing the enmity in himself. ^[Or "by it" (referring to the cross)]

###### v17
And coming, he proclaimed the good news of peace to you who were far away and peace to the ones who were near,

###### v18
because through him _we_ both have access in one Spirit to the Father.

###### v19
Consequently, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God,

###### v20
built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, ^[Or perhaps "capstone"]

###### v21
in whom the whole building, joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord,

###### v22
in whom you also are built up together into a dwelling place of God in _the_ Spirit. ^[Or "are built up together in spirit _= spiritually_ into a dwelling place of God" (cf. nrsv)]
