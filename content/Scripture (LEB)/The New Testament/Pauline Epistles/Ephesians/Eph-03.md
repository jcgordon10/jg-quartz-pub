###### v1
On account of this I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles

###### v2
--if indeed you have heard _about_ the stewardship of God's grace given to me for you.

###### v3
According to ^[Some manuscripts have "given to me for you, that according to"] revelation the mystery was made known to me, just as I wrote beforehand in brief,

###### v4
so that you may be able when you read ^[Or "by reading"] to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ

###### v5
(which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit):

###### v6
_that_ the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow sharers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,

###### v7
of which I became a servant, according to the gift of God's grace given to me, according to the working of his power.

###### v8
To me, the least of all the saints, was given this grace: to proclaim the good news of the fathomless riches of Christ to the Gentiles,

###### v9
and to enlighten everyone _as to_ what _is_ the administration of the mystery hidden from the ages by God, who created all _things_,

###### v10
in order that the many-sided wisdom of God might be made known now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly _places_ through the church,

###### v11
according to the purpose of the ages which he carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,

###### v12
in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through faith in him. ^[Or "through his _i.e., Christ's_ faithfulness"]

###### v13
Therefore I ask _you_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] not to be discouraged at my afflictions on behalf of you, which are your glory.

###### v14
On account of this, I bend my knees before the Father,

###### v15
from whom every ^[Or "the whole"] family in heaven and on earth is named,

###### v16
that he may grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person,

###### v17
_that_ Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith (you having been firmly rooted and established in love),

###### v18
in order that you may be strong enough to grasp together with all the saints what _is_ the breadth, and length, and height, and depth,

###### v19
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, in order that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.

###### v20
Now to the one who is able to do beyond all measure more than all that we ask or think, according to the power that is at work in us,

###### v21
to him _be_ the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.
