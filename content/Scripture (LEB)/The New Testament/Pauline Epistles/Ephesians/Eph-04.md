###### v1
Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to live in a manner worthy of the calling with which you were called:

###### v2
with all humility and gentleness, with patience, putting up with one another in love,

###### v3
being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;

###### v4
one body and one Spirit (just as also you were called with one hope of your calling),

###### v5
one Lord, one faith, one baptism,

###### v6
one God and Father of all, who _is_ over all, and through all, and in all.

###### v7
Now to each one of us was given this grace, according to the measure of Christ's gift.

###### v8
Therefore it says,
"Ascending on high he led captivity captive;
he gave gifts to men." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-68#v18|Ps 68:18]]]

###### v9
Now "he ascended," what is _it_, except that he also descended ^[Some secondary manuscripts add "first"] to the lower regions of the earth?

###### v10
The one who descended himself is also the one who ascended above all the heavens, in order that he might fill all _things_.

###### v11
And he himself gave some _as_ apostles and some _as_ prophets and some _as_ evangelists and some _as_ pastors and teachers

###### v12
for the equipping of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for building up the body of Christ,

###### v13
until we all reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to a measure of the maturity of the fullness of Christ,

###### v14
so that we may no longer be infants, tossed about by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, by the trickery of people, by craftiness with reference to the scheming of deceit.

###### v15
But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow into him _with reference to_ all _things_, who is the head, Christ,

###### v16
from whom the whole body, joined together and held together by every supporting ligament, according to the working by measure of each single part, the growth of the body makes for the building up of itself in love.

###### v17
This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, _that_ you no longer walk as the Gentiles walk: in the futility of their mind,

###### v18
being darkened in understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance _that_ is in them, because of the hardness of their heart,

###### v19
who, becoming callous, gave themselves over to licentiousness, for the pursuit of all uncleanness in greediness.

###### v20
But you did not learn Christ in this way,

###### v21
if indeed you have heard _about_ him, and you were taught by him (just as truth is in Jesus),

###### v22
_that_ you take off, according to your former way of life, the old man, who is being destroyed according to deceitful desires,

###### v23
be renewed in the spirit of your mind,

###### v24
and put on the new man (in accordance with God), who is created in righteousness and holiness from the truth.

###### v25
Therefore, putting aside the lie, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor, ^[An allusion to [[Zech-08#v16|Zech 8:16]]] because we are members of one another.

###### v26
Be angry and do not sin; ^[An allusion to [[Ps-04#v4|Ps 4:4]]] do not let the sun set on your anger,

###### v27
nor give place to the devil.

###### v28
The one who steals must steal no longer, but instead must labor, working with his own hands _what is_ good, so that he may have _something_ to share with the one who has need.

###### v29
_No rotten word must proceed_ ^[Literally "Every rotten word must not proceed"] from your mouth, but only something good for the building up of the need, in order that it may give grace to those who hear,

###### v30
and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

###### v31
All bitterness, and rage, and wrath, and clamor, and abusive speech, must be removed from you, together with all wickedness.

###### v32
Become ^[Some manuscripts have "But become"] kind toward one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as also God in Christ has forgiven you.
