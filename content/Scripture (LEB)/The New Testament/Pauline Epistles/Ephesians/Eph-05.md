[[Eph-04|Previous Chapter]] | [[Eph-06|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Therefore become imitators of God, as beloved children,

###### v2
and live in love, just as also Christ loved us, and gave himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God for a fragrant smell. ^[Or "a fragrant offering"]

###### v3
But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or greediness, must not even be named among you (as is fitting for saints),

###### v4
and obscenity, and foolish talk, or coarse jesting (which _are_ not proper), but rather thanksgiving.

###### v5
For this you know _for certain_ ^[Literally "for this you know, knowing"], that every sexually immoral _person_, or unclean _person_, or greedy _person_ (who is an idolater), does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.

###### v6
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these _things_ the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.

###### v7
Therefore do not be sharers ^[Or "partners"] with them,

###### v8
for you were formerly darkness, but now _you are_ light in the Lord. Live like children of light

###### v9
(for the fruit of the light _is_ in all goodness and righteousness and truth),

###### v10
trying to learn what is well-pleasing to the Lord.

###### v11
And do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even expose _them_.

###### v12
For it is shameful even to speak _about_ the things being _done_ by them in secret,

###### v13
but all _things_ exposed by the light are made visible,

###### v14
for everything made visible is light. Therefore it says,
Wake up, sleeper,
and rise from the dead,
and Christ will shine on you. ^[A quotation of unknown origin with possible allusions to [[Isa-26#v19|Isa 26:19]], [[Isa-51#v17|51:17]], [[Isa-52#v1|52:1]], [[Isa-60#v1|60:1]]]

###### v15
Therefore, consider carefully how you live, not as unwise but as wise,

###### v16
making the most of the time because the days are evil.

###### v17
Because of this do not become foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord _is_.

###### v18
And do not be drunk with wine (in which is dissipation), but be filled by the Spirit,

###### v19
speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and singing praise in your heart to the Lord,

###### v20
giving thanks always for all _things_ in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father,

###### v21
being subject to one another _out of reverence for_ ^[Literally "in _the_ fear of"] Christ

###### v22
--wives to their own husbands as to the Lord,

###### v23
because _the_ husband is _the_ head of the wife, as also Christ _is the_ head of the church (he himself _being the_ Savior of the body).

###### v24
But as the church is subject to Christ, thus also wives _should be subject_ ^[The words "should be subject" are not in the Greek text, but are an understood repetition from the previous clause] to their husbands in everything.

###### v25
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for her;

###### v26
in order that he might sanctify her by cleansing _her_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] with the washing of water by the word;

###### v27
in order that he might present to himself the church glorious, not having a spot or wrinkle or any such _thing_, but that she may be holy and blameless.

###### v28
Thus also husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. The one who loves his own wife loves himself.

###### v29
For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also Christ _does_ the church,

###### v30
because we are members of his body.

###### v31
"For this _reason_ a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." ^[A quotation from [[Gen-02#v24|Gen 2:24]]]

###### v32
(This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.)

###### v33
Only you also, each one _of you_, must thus love his own wife as himself, and the wife _must respect_ ^[Literally "that she fear"] her husband.
