[[Eph-05|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.

###### v2
"Honor your father and mother" (which is the first ^[Or "is a very important"] commandment with a promise),

###### v3
"in order that it may be well with you, and you may _live a long time_ ^[Literally "be long-lived"] on the earth." ^[A quotation from [[Exod-20#v12|Exod 20:12]] and/or [[Deut-05#v16|Deut 5:16]]]

###### v4
And fathers, do not make your children angry, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.

###### v5
Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ,

###### v6
not _while being watched_ ^[Literally "with eye service"], as people pleasers, but as slaves of Christ doing the will of God from the heart,

###### v7
serving with goodwill as to the Lord and not to people,

###### v8
_because you_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal] know that each one of you, whatever good he should do, ^[Some manuscripts have "if he should do anything good"] this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.

###### v9
And masters, do the same _things_ to them, giving up threats, knowing that both their Lord and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.

###### v10
Finally, become strong in the Lord and in the might of his strength.

###### v11
Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil,

###### v12
because our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual _forces_ of wickedness in the heavenly _places_.

###### v13
Because of this, take up the full armor of God, in order that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand.

###### v14
Stand therefore, girding your waist with truth, and putting on the breastplate of righteousness,

###### v15
and binding _shoes_ under your feet with the preparation of the good news of peace,

###### v16
in everything taking up the shield of faith, with which you are able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one,

###### v17
and receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,

###### v18
with all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the Spirit, and to this _end_ being alert with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints,

###### v19
and for me, that a word may be given to me at the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,

###### v20
for the sake of which I am an ambassador in chains, that _in them_ ^[Literally "in it" since "chain" is singular in the Greek text] I may speak freely, as it is necessary for me to speak.

###### v21
Now, so that you also may know _my circumstances_ ^[Literally "the things with me"], what I am doing, Tychicus, my dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make known to you all _things_,

###### v22
whom I have sent ^[Or "whom I am sending"] to you for this very _reason_, that you may know _our circumstances_ ^[Literally "the things concerning us"], and he may encourage your hearts.

###### v23
Peace to the brothers and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

###### v24
Grace _be_ with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility. ^[Or "with undying love"]
