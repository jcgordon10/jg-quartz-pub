[[Gal-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Paul, an apostle not from men nor by men but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead,

###### v2
and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia.

###### v3
Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, ^[Some manuscripts have "God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"]

###### v4
who gave himself for our sins in order to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,

###### v5
to whom _be_ the glory forever and ever. Amen.

###### v6
I am astonished that you are turning away so quickly from the one who called you by the grace of Christ to a different gospel,

###### v7
not that _there_ is a different _gospel_, except there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ.

###### v8
But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim a gospel to you contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let him be accursed!

###### v9
As we said before, and now I say again, if anyone is proclaiming a gospel _to_ you contrary to what you have received, let him be accursed!

###### v10
For am I now making an appeal to people or _to_ God? Or am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ.

###### v11
For I make known to you, brothers, the gospel that has been proclaimed by me, that it is not _of human origin_ ^[Literally "according to man"].

###### v12
For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught _it_, but _I received it_ through a revelation of Jesus Christ.

###### v13
For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism, that to an extraordinary degree I was persecuting the church of God, and trying to destroy it,

###### v14
and was progressing in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my nation, _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as causal] I was a far more zealous adherent of the traditions handed down by my forefathers.

###### v15
But when the one who set me apart ^[Some manuscripts have "when God who set me apart"] from my mother's womb and called _me_ by his grace was pleased

###### v16
to reveal his Son in me in order that I would proclaim the gospel _about_ him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood,

###### v17
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those _who were_ apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and I returned again to Damascus.

###### v18
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days,

###### v19
but I did not see _any_ others of the apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.

###### v20
(Now _the things_ which I am writing to you, behold, _I assure you_ before God that I am not lying.)

###### v21
Then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,

###### v22
but I was unknown _in person_ ^[Literally "by face"] to the churches of Judea _that are_ in Christ,

###### v23
and they were only hearing, "The one formerly persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith that formerly he was attempting to destroy,"

###### v24
and they were glorifying God because of me.
