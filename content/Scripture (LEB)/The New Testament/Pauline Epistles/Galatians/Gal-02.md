###### v1
Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking along Titus also.

###### v2
Now I went up _there_ because of a revelation and laid out to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles, but in private to the influential people, lest somehow I was running, or had run, in vain.

###### v3
But not even Titus _who was_ with me, _although_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as concessive] he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.

###### v4
Now _this was_ because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, in order that they might enslave us,

###### v5
to whom not even for an hour did we yield in subjection, in order that the truth of the gospel might remain continually with you.

###### v6
But from those _who were influential_ ^[Literally "who were thought to be something"] (whatever they were, _it makes_ no difference to me, _God does not show partiality_ ^[Literally "God does not receive the face of man"])--for those who were influential added nothing to me.

###### v7
But these, _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw that I had been entrusted _with_ the gospel to the uncircumcision, just as Peter to the circumcision

###### v8
(for the one who was at work through Peter for _his_ apostleship to the circumcision was at work also through me for the Gentiles),

###### v9
and _when_ James and Cephas and John--those thought to be pillars--acknowledged the grace given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right _hand_ of fellowship, in order that we _should go_ to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision.

###### v10
_They asked_ only that we should remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do.

###### v11
But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed _him_ to his face, because he was condemned.

###### v12
For before certain people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles, but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was afraid of") which is understood as causal] was afraid of those _who were_ of the circumcision,

###### v13
and the rest of the Jews also joined in _this_ hypocrisy with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with them in _their_ hypocrisy.

###### v14
But when I saw that they were not being straightforward with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of _them_ all, "If you, _although you_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as concessive] are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you try to compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?"

###### v15
We _are_ Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles,

###### v16
but knowing that a person is not justified by the works of the law, if not by faith in Jesus Christ, ^[Or "by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ"] and we have believed in Christ Jesus so that we may be justified by faith in Christ ^[Or "by the faithfulness of Christ"] and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law _no human being will be justified_ ^[Literally "all flesh will not be justified"].

###### v17
But if _while_ seeking to be justified by Christ, _we_ ourselves also have been found _to be_ sinners, then _is_ Christ an agent of sin? May it never be!

###### v18
For if I build up again these _things_ which I destroyed, I show myself _to be_ a transgressor.

###### v19
For through the law I died to the law, in order that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ,

###### v20
and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me, and that _life_ I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

###### v21
I do not declare invalid the grace of God, for if righteousness _is_ through the law, then Christ died to no purpose.
