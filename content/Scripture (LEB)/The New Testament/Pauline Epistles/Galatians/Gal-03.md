###### v1
O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed _as_ having been crucified?

###### v2
I want only to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

###### v3
Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now trying to be made complete by the flesh?

###### v4
Have you suffered so many _things_ for nothing--if indeed also _it was_ for nothing?

###### v5
Therefore does the one who gives you the Spirit and who works miracles among you _do so_ by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

###### v6
Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness,

###### v7
then understand that the ones _who have faith_ ^[Literally "of faith"], these are sons of Abraham.

###### v8
And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the good news in advance to Abraham: "In you all the nations ^[Or "Gentiles"; the same Greek word can be translated "nations" or "Gentiles" depending on the context] will be blessed." ^[A quotation from [[Gen-12#v3|Gen 12:3]]; [[Gen-18#v18|18:18]]]

###### v9
So then, the ones _who have_ faith are blessed together with Abraham who believed.

###### v10
For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written, "Cursed _is_ everyone who does not abide by all _the things_ that are written in the book of the law to do them." ^[A quotation from [[Deut-27#v26|Deut 27:26]]]

###### v11
Now _it is_ clear that no one is justified in the sight of God by the law, because "the one who is righteous will live by faith." ^[Or "the one who is righteous by faith will live," a quotation from [[Hab-02#v4|Hab 2:4]]]

###### v12
But the law is not from faith, but "the one who does these _things_ will live by them." ^[A quotation from [[Lev-18#v5|Lev 18:5]]]

###### v13
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("becoming") which is understood as means] becoming a curse for us, because it is written, "Cursed _is_ everyone who hangs on a tree," ^[A quotation from [[Deut-21#v23|Deut 21:23]]]

###### v14
in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

###### v15
Brothers, I am speaking according to a human perspective. Nevertheless, _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("has been ratified") which is understood as temporal] the covenant of a man has been ratified, no one declares _it_ invalid or adds additional provisions _to it_.

###### v16
Now to Abraham and to his descendant the promises were spoken. It does not say, "and to descendants," as concerning many, but as concerning one, "and to your descendant," ^[A quotation from [[Gen-12#v7|Gen 12:7]]; [[Gen-13#v15|13:15]]; [[Gen-17#v7|17:7]]; [[Gen-24#v7|24:7]]] who is Christ.

###### v17
Now I am saying this: the law, that came after four hundred and thirty years, does not revoke a covenant previously ratified by God, in order to nullify the promise.

###### v18
For if the inheritance _is_ from the law, _it is_ no longer from the promise, but God graciously gave _it_ to Abraham through the promise.

###### v19
Why then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, until the descendant should come to whom it had been promised, having been ordered through angels by the hand of a mediator.

###### v20
Now the mediator is not for one, but God is one.

###### v21
Therefore _is_ the law opposed to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, certainly righteousness would have been from the law.

###### v22
But the scripture imprisoned all under sin, in order that the promise could be given by faith ^[Or "through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ"] in Jesus Christ to those who believe.

###### v23
But before faith came, we were detained under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith was revealed.

###### v24
So then, the law became our guardian until Christ, in order that we could be justified by faith.

###### v25
But _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("has come") which is understood as temporal] faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.

###### v26
For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, ^[Or "For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith"]

###### v27
for as many _of you_ as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

###### v28
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

###### v29
And if you _are_ Christ's, then you are descendants of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.
