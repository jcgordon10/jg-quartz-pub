###### v1
Now I say, for as long a time _as_ the heir is a child, _he is_ no different from a slave, _although he_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is") which is understood as concessive] is master of everything,

###### v2
but he is under guardians and managers until the time set by _his_ father.

###### v3
So also we, when we were children, we were enslaved under the elemental spirits of the world.

###### v4
But when the fullness of time came, God sent out his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,

###### v5
in order that he might redeem those under the law, in order that we might receive the adoption.

###### v6
And because you are sons, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying out, "Abba! ^["Abba" is Aramaic for "father"] (Father!),"

###### v7
so that you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, also an heir through God.

###### v8
But at that time _when you_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as temporal] did not know God, you were enslaved to the things which by nature are not gods.

###### v9
But now, _because you_ have come to know God, or rather have come to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental spirits? Do you want to be enslaved to them ^[Literally "to whom"] all over again?

###### v10
You carefully observe days and months and seasons and years.

###### v11
I am afraid _for_ you, lest perhaps I have labored for you in vain!

###### v12
I ask you, brothers, become like me, because I also _have become_ like you. You have done me no _wrong_!

###### v13
But you know that because of an illness of the flesh I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time.

###### v14
And you did not despise or disdain _what was_ a trial for you in my flesh, but you welcomed me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus.

###### v15
So where _is_ your blessing? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes _and_ given _them_ to me!

###### v16
So then, have I become your enemy _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("being truthful") which is understood as means] being truthful to you?

###### v17
They zealously seek you, not commendably, but they want to exclude you, in order that you may seek them _zealously_.

###### v18
But _it is_ good to be sought zealously in good at all times, and not only when I am present with you.

###### v19
My children, for whom I am having birth pains again, until Christ is formed in you!

###### v20
But I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone because I am perplexed about you.

###### v21
Tell me, _you_ who are wanting to be under the law, do you not understand ^[Literally "hear"] the law?

###### v22
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the female slave and one by the free woman.

###### v23
But the one by the female slave was born according to human descent, and the one by the free woman through the promise,

###### v24
which _things_ are spoken allegorically, for these _women_ are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing _children_ for slavery, who is Hagar.

###### v25
Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is a slave with her children.

###### v26
But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.

###### v27
For it is written,
"Rejoice, O barren woman, who does not give birth to _children_;
burst out and shout, _you_ who do not have birth pains,
because many _are_ the children of the desolate _woman_,
even more than _those of_ the one who has a husband." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-54#v1|Isa 54:1]]]

###### v28
But you, brothers, are children of the promise, just as Isaac.

###### v29
But just as at that time the _child_ born according to human descent persecuted the _child born_ according to the Spirit, so also now.

###### v30
But what does the scripture say? "Drive out the female slave and her son, for the son of the female slave will never inherit with the son" ^[A quotation from [[Gen-21#v10|Gen 21:10,]] which does not include the words "of the free woman"] of the free woman.

###### v31
Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the female slave but of the free woman.
