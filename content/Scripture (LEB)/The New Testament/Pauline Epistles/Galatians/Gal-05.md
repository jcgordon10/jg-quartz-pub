[[Gal-04|Previous Chapter]] | [[Gal-06|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.

###### v2
Look! I, Paul, tell you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing!

###### v3
And again I testify to every man who becomes circumcised, that he is under obligation to keep the whole law.

###### v4
You are estranged from Christ, _you_ who are attempting to be justified ^[The present tense has been translated as conative here ("are attempting")] by the law; you have fallen from grace.

###### v5
For through the Spirit by faith we eagerly await the hope of righteousness.

###### v6
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.

###### v7
You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?

###### v8
This persuasion _is_ not from the one who calls you!

###### v9
A little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough.

###### v10
I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will think nothing different, but the one who is confusing you _will pay the penalty_ ^[Literally "will bear the _= his_ condemnation"], whoever he may be.

###### v11
Now, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.

###### v12
I wish that the ones who are disturbing you would also _castrate themselves_ ^[Literally "cut themselves off"]!

###### v13
For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not let your freedom _become_ an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.

###### v14
For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement, namely, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." ^[A quotation from [[Lev-19#v18|Lev 19:18]]]

###### v15
But if you bite and devour one another, watch out _that_ you are not consumed by one another.

###### v16
But I say, live by the Spirit, and you will never carry out the desire of the flesh.

###### v17
For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, for these are in opposition to one another, so that whatever you want, you may not do these _things_.

###### v18
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

###### v19
Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are sexual immorality, impurity, licentiousness,

###### v20
idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, factions,

###### v21
envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, _things_ which I am telling you _in advance_, just as I said before, that the ones who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

###### v22
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

###### v23
gentleness, self control. Against such things _there_ is no law.

###### v24
Now those _who belong to Christ_ ^[Literally "of Christ"] ^[Some manuscripts have "Christ Jesus"] have crucified the flesh together with its feelings and its desires.

###### v25
If we live by the Spirit, we must also follow the Spirit.

###### v26
We must not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
