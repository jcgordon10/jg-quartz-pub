[[Gal-05|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Brothers, even if a person is caught in some trespass, you _who are_ spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of humility, looking out for yourself, lest you also be tempted.

###### v2
Carry the burdens of one another, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

###### v3
For if anyone thinks he is something _although he_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is") which is understood as concessive] is nothing, he is deceiving himself.

###### v4
But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have a reason for boasting in himself alone, and not in someone else.

###### v5
For each one will carry his own burden.

###### v6
Now the one who is taught the word must share in all good _things_ with the one who teaches.

###### v7
Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked, for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap,

###### v8
because the one who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.

###### v9
And let us not grow weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap, _if we_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("give up") which is understood as conditional] do not give up.

###### v10
So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all _people_, and especially to those who belong to the household of faith.

###### v11
See with what large letters I am writing to you with my _own_ hand.

###### v12
As many as are wanting to make a good showing in the flesh, these are attempting to compel ^[The present tense has been translated as conative here ("are attempting")] you to be circumcised, only so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.

###### v13
For not even those who are circumcised observe the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised in order that they may boast in your flesh.

###### v14
But _as_ for me, may it never be _that I_ boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

###### v15
For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.

###### v16
And all those who follow this rule, peace and mercy _be_ on them and on the Israel of God.

###### v17
Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I carry on my body the marks of Jesus.

###### v18
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
