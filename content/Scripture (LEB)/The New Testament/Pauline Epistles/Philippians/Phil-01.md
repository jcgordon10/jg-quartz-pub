[[Phil-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons.

###### v2
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

###### v3
I give thanks to my God upon my every remembrance of you, ^[Or "upon your every remembrance _of me_"]

###### v4
always in my every prayer for all of you, making the prayer with joy,

###### v5
because of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now,

###### v6
convinced of this same _thing_, that the one who began a good work in you will finish _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] until the day of Christ Jesus,

###### v7
just as it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, _since_ ^[Here "since" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as causal] both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you are sharers of grace with me.

###### v8
For God _is_ my witness, that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.

###### v9
And this I pray: that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment,

###### v10
so that you may approve what is superior, in order that you may be sincere and blameless in ^[Or "for," or "until"] the day of Christ,

###### v11
having been filled _with the_ fruit of righteousness which _comes_ through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.

###### v12
Now I want you to know, brothers, that _my circumstances_ ^[Literally "the things with me"] have happened instead for the progress of the gospel,

###### v13
so that my imprisonment in Christ has become known in the whole praetorium ^[Or "praetorian guard," or "imperial guard"] and to all the rest,

###### v14
and most of the brothers, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, dare _even_ more to speak the word without fear.

###### v15
Some even because of envy and strife preach Christ, but some also because of good will.

###### v16
The latter _do so_ from love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.

###### v17
The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction in my imprisonment.

###### v18
_What is the result?_ ^[Literally "for what"] Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice. But also I will rejoice,

###### v19
for I know that this will turn out to me for deliverance through your prayer and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

###### v20
according to my eager expectation and hope, that I will be put to shame in nothing, but with all boldness, even now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether through life or through death.

###### v21
For to me to live _is_ Christ and to die _is_ gain.

###### v22
But if _it is_ to live in the flesh, this _is_ fruitful work for me, and which I will prefer _I do_ not know.

###### v23
But I am hard pressed _between the two options_ ^[Literally "by the two"], having the desire to depart and to be with Christ, _for this is very much better_ ^[Literally "for _this is_ more better by much"].

###### v24
But to stay on in the flesh _is_ more necessary for your sake.

###### v25
And because I am ^[Here "because" is supplied as a component of the participle ("convinced") which is understood as causal] convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,

###### v26
so that _what_ you can be proud of may increase in Christ Jesus because of me through my return again to you.

###### v27
Only lead your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent I hear _your circumstances_ ^[Literally "the things concerning you"], that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul contending side by side for the faith of the gospel,

###### v28
and not letting yourselves be intimidated in anything by your opponents, which is a sign of destruction to them, but of your salvation, and this from God,

###### v29
because to you has been graciously granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on behalf of him,

###### v30
having the same struggle which you saw in me and now hear about in me.
