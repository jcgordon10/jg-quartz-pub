[[Phil-01|Previous Chapter]] | [[Phil-03|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Therefore, if _there is_ any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,

###### v2
complete my joy, so that _you are in agreement_ ^[Literally "you think the same _thing_], having the same love, united in spirit, _having one purpose_ ^[Literally "thinking the one _thing_"].

###### v3
_Do_ nothing according to selfish ambition or according to empty conceit, but in humility considering one another better than yourselves,

###### v4
each of you ^[Some manuscripts have "each one of you"] not looking out for _your own interests_ ^[Literally "the things of yourselves"], but also each of you _for_ _the interests_ ^[Literally "the things"] of others.

###### v5
Think this in ^[Or "among"] yourselves which _was_ also in Christ Jesus,

###### v6
who, existing in the form of God,
did not consider being equal with God something to be grasped,

###### v7
but emptied himself
_by_ ^[Here "by" is supplied as a component of the participle ("taking") which is understood as means] taking the form of a slave,
_by_ ^[Here "by" is supplied as a component of the participle ("becoming") which is understood as means] becoming in the likeness of people.
And being found in appearance like a man,

###### v8
he humbled himself
_by_ ^[Here "by" is supplied as a component of the participle ("becoming") which is understood as means] becoming obedient to the point of death,
that is, death on a cross.

###### v9
Therefore also God exalted him
and graciously granted him the name above every name,

###### v10
so that at the name of Jesus
every knee should bow,
of _those_ in heaven and of _those_ on earth and of _those_ under the earth,

###### v11
and every tongue confess
that Jesus Christ _is_ Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.

###### v12
Therefore my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

###### v13
For the one at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure, is God.

###### v14
Do all _things_ without grumbling and disputing,

###### v15
in order that you may become blameless and innocent, children of God without fault ^[Or "blameless"] in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as stars in the world, ^[Or possibly "in the universe"]

###### v16
holding fast to the word of life, for a source of pride ^[Or "for a cause of boasting"] to me in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.

###### v17
But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and rejoice with all of you.

###### v18
And _in_ the same _way_ also you rejoice and rejoice with me.

###### v19
But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I also may be encouraged _when I_ ^[Here "when" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as temporal] know _your circumstances_ ^[Literally "the things concerning you"].

###### v20
For I have no one like-minded who _will_ sincerely be concerned about _your circumstances_ ^[Literally "the things concerning you"].

###### v21
For they all seek _their own interests_ ^[Literally "the things of themselves"], not those of Jesus Christ.

###### v22
But you know his proven character, that like a child with a father he served with me for the gospel.

###### v23
Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see _my circumstances_ ^[Literally "the things concerning me"].

###### v24
And I am convinced in the Lord that I myself will arrive shortly also.

###### v25
But I considered _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, but your messenger and servant of my need,

###### v26
because he was longing for all of you and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.

###### v27
For indeed he was sick, coming near to death, but God had mercy on him and not _on_ him only, but also _on_ me, so that I would not have grief upon grief.

###### v28
Therefore I am sending him with special urgency, in order that _when_ ^[Here "when" is supplied as a component of the participle ("see") which is understood as temporal] you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.

###### v29
Therefore welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and consider such _people_ highly honored,

###### v30
because on account of the work of Christ he came near to the point of death, risking his life in order that _he might make up for your inability to serve me_ ^[Literally "he might fill up your lack of service to me"].
