###### v1
Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same _things_ to you _is_ not troublesome to me, but _is_ a safeguard for you.

###### v2
Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the mutilation. ^[This term is a wordplay on the Greek word "circumcision"]

###### v3
For we are the circumcision, the ones who worship ^[Or "who serve"] by the Spirit ^[Or "in the Spirit"] of God and boast in Christ Jesus and do not _put_ confidence in the flesh,

###### v4
although I _could_ have confidence even in the flesh.
If anyone else thinks to put confidence in the flesh, I _can do so_ more:

###### v5
_circumcised on the eighth day_ ^[Literally "_with respect to_ circumcision _it was_ on the eighth day"], from the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew _born_ from Hebrews, according to the law a Pharisee,

###### v6
according to zeal persecuting the church, according to the righteousness in the law being blameless.

###### v7
But whatever _things_ were gain to me, these _things_ I have considered loss because of Christ.

###### v8
_More than that_ ^[Literally "but on the contrary"], _I_ even consider all _things_ to be loss because of the surpassing greatness of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for the sake of whom I have suffered the loss of all _things_, and consider _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] dung, in order that I may gain Christ

###### v9
and may be found in him, not having my righteousness _which is_ from the law, but _which is_ through faith in Christ, ^[Or "through Christ's faithfulness"] the righteousness from God on the basis of faith, ^[Or "on the basis of _his_ faithfulness"]

###### v10
so that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,

###### v11
if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.

###### v12
Not that I have already received _this_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] or _have_ already been made perfect, but I press on if indeed I may lay hold of _that_ for which also I was laid hold of by Christ. ^[Some manuscripts have "Christ Jesus"]

###### v13
Brothers, I do not consider myself to have laid hold of _it_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] But _I do_ one _thing_, forgetting the things behind and straining toward the things ahead,

###### v14
I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

###### v15
Therefore as many as _are_ perfect, _let us hold this opinion_ ^[Literally "let us think this"], and if you think anything differently, God will reveal this also to you.

###### v16
Only to what we have attained, to the same hold on.

###### v17
Become fellow imitators of me, brothers, and observe those who walk in this way, just as you have us _as_ an example.

###### v18
For many live, of whom I spoke about to you many times, but now speak about even weeping, _as_ the enemies of the cross of Christ,

###### v19
whose end _is_ destruction, whose God _is_ the stomach, and _whose_ glory _is_ in their shame, the ones who think on earthly things.

###### v20
For our commonwealth exists in heaven, from which also we eagerly await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,

###### v21
who will transform our humble body _to be_ conformed to his glorious body, in accordance with the power that enables him even to subject all _things_ to himself.
