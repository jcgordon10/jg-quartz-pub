[[Phil-03|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
So then, my beloved and greatly desired brothers, my joy and crown, thus stand firm in the Lord, dear friends.

###### v2
I appeal to Euodia and I appeal to Syntyche _to be in agreement_ ^[Literally "to think the same _thing_"] in the Lord.

###### v3
Yes, I ask also you, true yokefellow, help them, who struggled along with me in the gospel with both Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names _are_ in the book of life.

###### v4
Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice.

###### v5
Let your gentleness be made known to all people. The Lord _is_ near.

###### v6
Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.

###### v7
And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds ^[Or "thoughts"] in Christ Jesus.

###### v8
Finally, brothers, whatever _things_ are true, whatever _things are_ honorable, whatever _things are_ right, whatever _things are_ pure, whatever _things are_ pleasing, whatever _things are_ commendable, if _there is_ any excellence of character and if anything praiseworthy, think about these _things_.

###### v9
And _the things_ which you have learned and received and heard about and seen in me, practice these _things_, and the God of peace will be with you.

###### v10
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last _you have renewed your concern for me_ ^[Literally "you have revived to think on behalf of me"], for whom also you were thinking, but you had no opportunity _to express it_.

###### v11
Not that I speak from need, for I have learned to be content in whatever _circumstances_ I am.

###### v12
I know _how_ both _to make do with little_ ^[Literally "to be humbled"] and I know _how_ _to have an abundance_ ^[Literally "to abound"]. In everything and in all _things_ I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both _to have an abundance_ ^[Literally "to abound"] and to go without.

###### v13
I am able _to do_ all _things_ by the one who strengthens me.

###### v14
Nevertheless you have done well by sharing ^[Here "by" is supplied as a component of the participle ("sharing") which is understood as means] with me in my affliction.

###### v15
Now you also know, Philippians, that at the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone,

###### v16
because even in Thessalonica _on more than one occasion_ ^[Literally "both once and twice"] you sent for my need.

###### v17
Not that I seek the gift, but I seek for the profit that increases to your account.

###### v18
But I have received everything _in full_ and have an abundance; _I am well supplied_ ^[Literally "I have been made full"] _because_ ^[Here "because" is supplied as a component of the participle ("received") which is understood as causal] I received from Epaphroditus _what you had sent_ ^[Literally "the things from you"], a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.

###### v19
And my God will fulfill your every need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

###### v20
Now to our God and Father _be_ the glory _forever and ever_ ^[Literally "to the ages of the ages"]. Amen.

###### v21
Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me greet you.

###### v22
All the saints greet you, and especially those of Caesar's household.

###### v23
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with your spirit.
