###### v1
Therefore you are without excuse, O man, every one _of you_ who passes judgment. For in that which you pass judgment on someone else, you condemn yourself, for you who are passing judgment are doing the same _things_.

###### v2
Now we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things.

###### v3
But do you think this, O man who passes judgment on those who do such things, and who does the same _things_, that you will escape the judgment of God?

###### v4
Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?

###### v5
But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God,

###### v6
who will reward each one according to his works:

###### v7
to those who, by perseverance in good work, seek glory and honor and immortality, eternal life,

###### v8
but to those _who act_ from selfish ambition and who disobey the truth, but who obey unrighteousness, wrath and anger.

###### v9
_There will be_ affliction and distress for every _human being_ ^[Literally "soul of man"] who does evil, of the Jew first and of the Greek,

###### v10
but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and to the Greek.

###### v11
For _there_ is no partiality with God.

###### v12
For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.

###### v13
For it is not the hearers of the law _who are_ righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be declared righteous. ^[Or "will be justified"]

###### v14
For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, _although they_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as concessive] do not have the law, are a law to themselves,

###### v15
who show the work of the law written on their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts _one_ after another accusing or even defending them

###### v16
on the day when God judges the secret things of people, according to my gospel, through ^[Or "by"] Christ Jesus.

###### v17
But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God

###### v18
and know his will and approve the things that are superior, _because you_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are instructed") which is understood as causal] are instructed by the law,

###### v19
and are confident _that_ you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those in darkness,

###### v20
an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth in the law.

###### v21
Therefore, the one who teaches someone else, do you not teach yourself? The one who preaches not to steal, do you steal?

###### v22
The one who says not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? The one who abhors idols, do you rob temples?

###### v23
Who boast in the law, by the transgression of the law you dishonor God! ^[Or "do you dishonor God?" (a number of translators and interpreters take this phrase as a final rhetorical question; the present translation regards it as a final summary statement to be taken ironically)]

###### v24
For just as it is written, "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-52#v5|Isa 52:5]]]

###### v25
For circumcision is of value if you do the law, but if you should be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.

###### v26
Therefore, if the uncircumcised person follows the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision?

###### v27
And the uncircumcised person by nature who carries out the law will judge you who, _though provided_ with _the precise written code_ ^[Literally "the letter"] and circumcision _are_ a transgressor of the law.

###### v28
For the Jew is not _one outwardly_ ^[Literally "in the open"], nor _is_ circumcision _outwardly_ ^[Literally "in the open"], in the flesh.

###### v29
But the Jew _is one inwardly_ ^[Literally "in secret"], and circumcision _is_ of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter, whose praise _is_ not from people but from God.
