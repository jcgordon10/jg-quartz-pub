###### v1
Therefore, what _is_ the advantage of the Jew, or what _is_ the use of circumcision?

###### v2
Much in every way. For first, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.

###### v3
_What is the result_ ^[Literally "for what"] if some refused to believe? Their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, _will it_?

###### v4
May it never be! But let God be true but every human being a liar, just as it is written,
"In order that you may be justified in your words,
and may prevail when you are ^[Or, if the form is understood as middle voice, "when you yourself judge"] judged." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-51#v4|Ps 51:4]]]

###### v5
But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God, who inflicts wrath, _is_ not unjust, _is he_? (I am speaking according to a human perspective.)

###### v6
May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world?

###### v7
But if by my lying, the truth of God abounded to his glory, why am I also still condemned as a sinner?

###### v8
And _why_ not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say), "Let us do evil, in order that good may come _of it_? Their ^[Literally "whose"] condemnation is just!

###### v9
What then? Do we have an advantage? Not at all. For we have already charged both Jews and Greeks are all under sin,

###### v10
just as it is written,
"_There_ is no one righteous, not even one;

###### v11
    _there_ is no one who understands;
_there_ is no one who seeks God.

###### v12
All have turned aside together; they have become worthless;
_There_ is no one who practices kindness;
_there_ is not even one. ^[Verses [[Rom-03#v10|10–12]][[Rom-03#v11|]][[Rom-03#v12|]] are a quotation from [[Ps-14#v1|Ps 14:1–3]][[Ps-14#v2|]][[Ps-14#v3|]]]

###### v13
Their throat _is_ an opened grave;
they deceive with their tongues;
the venom of asps _is_ under their lips, ^[A quotation from [[Ps-05#v9|Ps 5:9]] and [[Ps-140#v3|Ps 140:3]]]

###### v14
    whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. ^[A quotation from [[Ps-10#v7|Ps 10:7]]]

###### v15
Their feet _are_ swift to shed blood;

###### v16
    destruction and distress _are_ in their paths,

###### v17
and they have not known the way of peace. ^[Verses [[Rom-03#v15|15–17]][[Rom-03#v16|]][[Rom-03#v17|]] are a quotation from [[Isa-59#v7|Isa 59:7–8]][[Isa-59#v8|]]]

###### v18
    The fear of God is not before their eyes." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-36#v1|Ps 36:1]]]

###### v19
Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those under the law, in order that every mouth may be closed and the whole world may become accountable to God.

###### v20
For by the works of the law _no person will be declared righteous_ ^[Literally "all flesh will not be declared righteous"] before him, for through the law _comes_ knowledge of sin.

###### v21
But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified about by the law and the prophets--

###### v22
that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ ^[Or "through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ"] to all who believe. For _there_ is no distinction,

###### v23
for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

###### v24
being justified as a gift by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,

###### v25
whom God made publicly available as the mercy seat ^[Or "as the place of propitiation"] through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness, because of the passing over of previously committed sins,

###### v26
in the forbearance of God, for the demonstration of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just and the one who justifies the _person_ by faith ^[Or "by Jesus' faithfulness"] in Jesus.

###### v27
Therefore, where _is_ boasting? It has been excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law ^[Or "a principle"] of faith.

###### v28
For we consider a person to be justified by faith apart from the works of the law.

###### v29
Or _is God_ the God of the Jews only? _Is he_ not also _the God_ of the Gentiles? Yes, also of the Gentiles,

###### v30
since God _is_ one, who will justify _those who are circumcised_ ^[Literally "circumcision"] by faith and _those who are uncircumcised_ ^[Literally "uncircumcision"] through faith.

###### v31
Therefore, do we nullify the law through faith? May it never be! But we uphold the law.
