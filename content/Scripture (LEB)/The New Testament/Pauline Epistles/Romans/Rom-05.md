###### v1
Therefore, _because we_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have been declared righteous") which is understood as causal] have been declared righteous by faith, we have ^[Although a number of important manuscripts read the subjunctive mood here ("let us have"), almost all English versions prefer the indicative mood ("we have") which is supported by many other manuscripts] peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,

###### v2
through whom also we have _obtained_ access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in the hope of the glory of God.

###### v3
And not only _this_, but we also boast in our afflictions, _because we_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal] know that affliction produces patient endurance,

###### v4
and patient endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope,

###### v5
and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.

###### v6
For _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as temporal] we were still helpless, yet at the proper time Christ died for the ungodly.

###### v7
For only rarely will someone die on behalf of a righteous person (for on behalf of a good person possibly someone might even dare to die),

###### v8
but God demonstrates his own love for us, _in_ that _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as temporal] we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

###### v9
Therefore, by much more, _because we_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have been declared righteous") which is understood as causal] have been declared righteous now by his blood, we will be saved through him from the wrath.

###### v10
For if, _while we_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as temporal] were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, by much more, having been reconciled, we will be saved by his life.

###### v11
And not only _this_, but also _we are_ boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.

###### v12
Because of this, just as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death spread to all people because all sinned.

###### v13
For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one's account _when there_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is") which is understood as temporal] is no law.

###### v14
But death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of the one who is to come.

###### v15
_But the gift is not like the trespass_ ^[Literally "but not like the trespass so also the gift"], for if by the trespass of the one, the many died, by much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, multiply to the many.

###### v16
And the gift _is_ not as through the one who sinned, for on the one hand, judgment from the one _sin_ _led_ to condemnation, but the gift, from many trespasses, _led_ to justification.

###### v17
For if by the trespass of the one _man_, death reigned through the one _man_, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.

###### v18
Consequently therefore, as through one trespass _came_ condemnation to all people, so also through one righteous deed _came_ justification of life to all people.

###### v19
For just as through the disobedience of the one man, the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one, the many will be made righteous.

###### v20
Now the law came in as a side issue, in order that the trespass could increase, but where sin increased, grace was present in greater abundance,

###### v21
so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
