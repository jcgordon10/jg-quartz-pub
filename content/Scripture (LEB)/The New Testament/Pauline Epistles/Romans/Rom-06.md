###### v1
What therefore shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, in order that grace may increase?

###### v2
May it never be! How can we who died to sin still live in it?

###### v3
Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?

###### v4
Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we may live _a new way of life_ ^[Literally "in newness of life"].

###### v5
For if we have become identified with _him_ in the likeness of his death, certainly also we will be _identified with him in the likeness_ ^[The elliptical phrase "identified with him in the likeness" has been supplied in the translation for clarity] of _his_ resurrection,

###### v6
knowing this, that our old man was crucified together with _him_, in order that the body of sin may be done away with, _that_ we may no longer be enslaved to sin.

###### v7
For the one who has died has been freed from sin.

###### v8
Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him,

###### v9
knowing that Christ, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("has been raised") which is understood as causal] has been raised from the dead, is going to die no more, death no longer being master over him.

###### v10
For that _death_ he died, he died to sin once and never again, but that _life_ he lives, he lives to God.

###### v11
So also you, consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.

###### v12
Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that _you_ obey its desires,

###### v13
and do not present your members to sin _as_ instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and your members to God _as_ instruments of righteousness.

###### v14
For sin will not be master over you, because you are not under law, but under grace.

###### v15
What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!

###### v16
Do you not know that to whomever you present yourselves _as_ slaves for obedience, you are slaves to whomever you obey, whether sin, _leading_ to death, or obedience, _leading_ to righteousness?

###### v17
But thanks _be_ to God that you were slaves of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart the pattern of teaching to which you were entrusted,

###### v18
and having been set free from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness.

###### v19
(I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh.) For just as you presented your members _as_ slaves to immorality and lawlessness, _leading_ to lawlessness, so now present your members _as_ slaves to righteousness, _leading_ to sanctification.

###### v20
For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with respect to righteousness.

###### v21
Therefore what sort of fruit did you have then, about which you are now ashamed? For the end of those _things_ _is_ death.

###### v22
But now, having been set free from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit _leading_ to sanctification, and its end _is_ eternal life.

###### v23
For the compensation due sin _is_ death, but the gift of God _is_ eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
