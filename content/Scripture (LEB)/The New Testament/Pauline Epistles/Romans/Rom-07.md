###### v1
Or do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law is master of a person for as long a time _as_ he lives?

###### v2
For the married woman is bound by law to _her_ husband while he lives, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of the husband.

###### v3
Therefore as a result, if she belongs to another man _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is living") which is understood as temporal] her husband is living, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress _if she_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("belongs") which is understood as conditional] belongs to another man.

###### v4
So then, my brothers, you also were brought to death with respect to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.

###### v5
For when we were in the flesh, sinful desires were working through the law in our members, to bear fruit for death.

###### v6
But now we have been released from the law, _because we_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have died") which is understood as causal] have died _to that_ by which we were bound, so that we may serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter _of the law_.

###### v7
What then shall we say? _Is_ the law sin? May it never be! But I would not have known sin except through the law, for I would not have known covetousness if the law had not said, "Do not covet." ^[A quotation from [[Exod-20#v17|Exod 20:17]]; [[Deut-05#v21|Deut 5:21]]]

###### v8
But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all _kinds of_ covetousness. For apart from the law, sin _is_ dead.

###### v9
And I was alive once, apart from the law, but _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came") which is understood as temporal] the commandment came, sin sprang to life

###### v10
and I died, and this commandment which _was_ to _lead to_ life was found with respect to me to _lead to_ death.

###### v11
For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed _me_.

###### v12
So then, the law _is_ holy, and the commandment _is_ holy and righteous and good.

###### v13
Therefore, _did that which is_ good become death to me? May it never be! Rather _it was_ sin, in order that it might be recognized _as_ sin, producing death through _what is_ good for me, in order that sin might become sinful to an extraordinary degree through the commandment.

###### v14
For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, _sold into slavery to sin_ ^[Literally "sold under sin"].

###### v15
For what I am doing I do not understand, because what I want _to do_, this I do not practice, but what I hate, this I do.

###### v16
But if what I do not want _to do_, this I do, I agree with the law that _it is_ good.

###### v17
But now I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that lives in me.

###### v18
For I know that good does not live in me, that is, in my flesh. For the willing is present in me, but the doing _of_ the good _is_ not.

###### v19
For the good that I want _to do_, I do not do, but the evil that I do not want _to do_, this I do.

###### v20
But if what I do not want _to do_, this I am doing, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that lives in me.

###### v21
Consequently, I find the principle with me, the one who wants to do good, that evil is present with me. ^[Or "in me"]

###### v22
For I joyfully agree with the law of God in my inner person,

###### v23
but I observe another law in my members, at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that exists in my members.

###### v24
Wretched man _that_ I _am_! Who will rescue me from this body of death?

###### v25
Thanks _be_ ^[Some manuscripts have "But thanks _be_"] to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself with my mind am enslaved to the law of God, but with my flesh _I am enslaved_ to the law of sin.
