###### v1
Consequently, _there is_ now no condemnation for those _who are_ in Christ Jesus.

###### v2
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.

###### v3
For what _was_ impossible for the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, God _did_. _By_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("sending") which is understood as means] sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,

###### v4
in order that the requirement of the law would be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

###### v5
For those who are _living_ according to the flesh are intent on the things of the flesh, but those _who are living_ according to the Spirit _are intent on_ the things of the Spirit.

###### v6
For the mindset of the flesh _is_ death, but the mindset of the Spirit _is_ life and peace,

###### v7
because the mindset of the flesh _is_ enmity toward God, for _it is_ not subjected to the law of God, for _it is_ not able _to do so_,

###### v8
and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God.

###### v9
But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, this person _does not belong to him_ ^[Literally "is not of him"].

###### v10
But if Christ _is_ in you, the body _is_ dead because of sin, but the Spirit _is_ life because of righteousness.

###### v11
And if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, the one who raised Christ Jesus ^[Some manuscripts omit "Jesus"] from the dead will also make alive your mortal bodies through his Spirit who lives in you.

###### v12
So then, brothers, we are obligated not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.

###### v13
For if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.

###### v14
For all those who are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.

###### v15
For you have not received a spirit of slavery _leading_ to fear again, but you have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, "Abba! ^["Abba" means "father" in Aramaic] Father!"

###### v16
The Spirit himself confirms to our spirit that we are children of God,

###### v17
and if children, also heirs--heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer together _with him_ so that we may also be glorified together _with him_.

###### v18
For I consider that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy _to be compared_ with the glory that is about to be revealed to us.

###### v19
For the eagerly expecting creation awaits eagerly the revelation of the sons of God.

###### v20
For the creation has been subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of the one who subjected _it_, in hope

###### v21
that the creation itself also will be set free from its servility to decay, into the glorious freedom of the children of God.

###### v22
For we know that the whole creation groans together and suffers agony together until now.

###### v23
Not only _this_, but we ourselves also, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves _while we_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("await eagerly") which is understood as temporal] await eagerly _our_ adoption, the redemption of our body.

###### v24
For in hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, for who hopes for what he sees?

###### v25
But if we hope for what we do not see, we await _it_ eagerly with patient endurance.

###### v26
And likewise also, the Spirit helps _us_ in our weakness, for we do not know how to pray as one ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes _for us_ _with_ unexpressed groanings.

###### v27
And the one who searches our hearts knows what the mindset of the Spirit _is_, because he intercedes on behalf of the saints according to _the will of_ God.

###### v28
And we know that all _things_ work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to _his_ purpose,

###### v29
because _those_ whom he foreknew, he also predestined _to be_ conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brothers.

###### v30
And _those_ whom he predestined, these _he_ also called, and _those_ whom he called, these _he_ also justified, and _those_ whom he justified, these _he_ also glorified.

###### v31
What then shall we say about these _things_? If God _is_ for us, who _can be_ against us?

###### v32
Indeed, _he_ who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also, together with him, freely give us all _things_?

###### v33
Who will bring charges against God's elect? God _is_ the one who justifies.

###### v34
Who _is_ the one who condemns? Christ ^[Some manuscripts have "Christ Jesus"] _is_ the one who died, and more than that, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.

###### v35
Who will separate us from the love of Christ? _Will_ affliction or distress or persecution or hunger or lack of sufficient clothing or danger or the sword?

###### v36
Just as it is written,
"On account of you we are being put to death the whole day _long_;
we are considered as sheep for slaughter." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-44#v22|Ps 44:22]]]

###### v37
_No_, but in all these _things_ we prevail completely through the one who loved us.

###### v38
For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,

###### v39
nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
