[[Rom-08|Previous Chapter]] | [[Rom-10|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
I am telling the truth in Christ--_I am_ not lying; my conscience bears witness to me in the Holy Spirit--

###### v2
that my grief is great and _there is_ constant distress in my heart.

###### v3
For I could wish myself to be accursed from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my fellow countrymen according to the flesh,

###### v4
who are Israelites, _to_ whom _belong_ the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the _temple_ service, and the promises,

###### v5
_to_ whom _belong_ the patriarchs, and from whom _is_ the Christ according to human descent, who is God over all, blessed _forever_ ^[Literally "for eternity"]! Amen.

###### v6
But _it is_ not as if the word of God had failed. For not all those _who are descended_ from Israel _are truly_ Israel,

###### v7
nor _are they_ all children because they are descendants of Abraham, but "In Isaac will your descendants be named." ^[A quotation from [[Gen-21#v12|Gen 21:12]]]

###### v8
That is, _it is_ not the children _by human descent_ ^[Literally "of the flesh"] _who are_ children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants.

###### v9
For the statement of the promise _is_ this: "At this time I will return and _Sarah will have_ ^[Literally "there will be to Sarah"] a son." ^[A quotation from [[Gen-18#v10|Gen 18:10]], [[Gen-18#v14|14]]]

###### v10
And not only _this_, but also _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("having conception" = "conceived") which is understood as temporal] Rebecca conceived children by one _man_, ^[Or perhaps "by one _act of sexual intercourse_"] Isaac our father--

###### v11
for _although they_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("been born") which is understood as concessive] had not yet been born, or done anything good or evil, in order that the purpose of God according to election might remain,

###### v12
not by works but by the one who calls--it was said to her, "The older will serve the younger," ^[A quotation from [[Gen-25#v23|Gen 25:23]]]

###### v13
just as it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated." ^[A quotation from [[Mal-01#v2|Mal 1:2–3]][[Mal-01#v3|]]]

###### v14
What then shall we say? _There is_ no injustice with God, _is there_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here] May it never be!

###### v15
For to Moses he says, "I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I have compassion." ^[A quotation from [[Exod-33#v19|Exod 33:19]]]

###### v16
Consequently therefore, _it does not depend on the_ ^[Literally "not of the"] one who wills or on the one who runs, but on God who shows mercy.

###### v17
For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very _reason_ I have raised you up, so that I may demonstrate my power in you, and so that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth." ^[A quotation from [[Exod-09#v16|Exod 9:16]]]

###### v18
Consequently therefore, he has mercy on whomever he wishes, and he hardens whomever he wishes.

###### v19
Therefore you will say to me, "Why then does he still find fault? For who has resisted ^[Or "who resists"] his will?

###### v20
On the contrary, O man, who are you who answers back to God? Will what is molded say to the one who molded _it_, "Why did you make me like this"? ^[A quotation from [[Isa-29#v16|Isa 29:16]]; [[Isa-45#v9|45:9]]]

###### v21
Or does the potter not have authority over the clay, to make from the same lump a vessel that _is_ for _honorable use_ ^[Literally "honor"] and _one_ that _is_ for _ordinary use_ ^[Literally "dishonor"]?

###### v22
And _what_ if God, wanting to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?

###### v23
And _he did so_ ^[The words "he did so" are not in the Greek text, but are an understood repetition from the previous clause] in order that he could make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory,

###### v24
us whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?

###### v25
As he also says in Hosea,
"I will call those _who were_ not my people, 'My people,'
and those _who were_ not loved, 'Loved.' ^[A quotation from [[Hos-02#v23|Hos 2:23]]]

###### v26
And it will be in the place where it was said to them, 'You _are_ not my people,'
there they will be called 'sons of the living God.'" ^[A quotation from [[Hos-01#v10|Hos 1:10]]]

###### v27
And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel,
"_Even_ if the number of the sons of Israel is like the sand of the sea,
the remnant will be saved,

###### v28
_for the Lord will execute his sentence thoroughly and decisively_ ^[Literally "for the Lord will act, closing the account and cutting short"] upon the earth." ^[A paraphrased quotation from [[Isa-10#v22|Isa 10:22–23]][[Isa-10#v23|]]]

###### v29
And just as Isaiah foretold,
"If the Lord of hosts had not left us descendants,
we would have become like Sodom
and would have resembled Gomorrah." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-01#v9|Isa 1:9]]]

###### v30
What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness--even the righteousness _that is_ by faith.

###### v31
But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, did not attain to the law.

###### v32
Why that? Because _they did_ not _pursue it_ by faith, but as _if_ by works. They stumbled over the _stone that causes people to stumble_ ^[Literally "stone of stumbling"],

###### v33
just as it is written,
"Behold, I am laying in Zion _a stone that causes people to stumble_ ^[Literally "a stone of stumbling"],
and _a rock that causes them to fall_ ^[Literally "a rock of offense"],
and the one who believes in him will not be put to shame." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-28#v16|Isa 28:16]]; [[Isa-08#v14|8:14]]]
