###### v1
Brothers, the desire of my heart and my prayer to God on behalf of them _is_ for _their_ salvation.

###### v2
For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.

###### v3
For ignoring the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, ^[Some manuscripts have "their own righteousness"] they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.

###### v4
For Christ _is the_ end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.

###### v5
For Moses writes about the righteousness _that is_ from the law: "The person who does _this_ ^[Some manuscripts explicitly state "these _things_"] will live by it." ^[A quotation from [[Lev-18#v5|Lev 18:5]]] ^[Some manuscripts have "them"]

###### v6
But the righteousness from faith speaks like this: "Do not say in your heart, ^[A quotation from [[Deut-09#v4|Deut 9:4]]] 'Who will ascend into heaven?'" ^[A quotation from [[Deut-30#v12|Deut 30:12]]] (that is, to bring Christ down),

###### v7
or "Who will descend into the abyss?" ^[A quotation from [[Deut-30#v13|Deut 30:13]]] (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).

###### v8
But what does it say? "The word is near to you, in your mouth and in your heart" ^[A quotation from [[Deut-30#v14|Deut 30:14]]] (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim),

###### v9
that ^[Or "because"] if you confess with your mouth "Jesus _is_ Lord" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

###### v10
For with the heart one believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses, resulting in salvation.

###### v11
For the scripture says, "Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-28#v16|Isa 28:16]]]

###### v12
For _there_ is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same _Lord_ _is_ Lord of all, who is rich to all who call upon him.

###### v13
For "everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved." ^[A quotation from [[Joel-02#v32|Joel 2:32]]]

###### v14
How then will they call upon _him_ in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe _in him_ about whom they have not heard? And how will they hear about _him_ without one who preaches _to them_?

###### v15
And how will they preach, unless they are sent? Just as it is written, "How timely _are_ the feet of those who bring good news of good things." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-52#v7|Isa 52:7]]; [[Nah-01#v15|Nah 1:15]]]

###### v16
But not all have obeyed the good news, for Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?" ^[A quotation from [[Isa-53#v1|Isa 53:1]]]

###### v17
Consequently, faith _comes_ by hearing, and hearing through the word about Christ.

###### v18
But I say, they have not heard, have they? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here] On the contrary,
"Their voice has gone out to all the earth,
and their words to the ends of the inhabited world." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-19#v4|Ps 19:4]]]

###### v19
But I say, Israel did not know, did they? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here] First, Moses says,
"I will provoke you _to jealousy_ by _those who are_ not a nation;
by a senseless nation I will provoke you _to anger_." ^[A quotation from [[Deut-32#v21|Deut 32:21]]]

###### v20
And Isaiah is very bold and says,
"I was found by those who did not seek me;
I became known to those who did not ask for me." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-65#v1|Isa 65:1]]]

###### v21
But about Israel he says,
"The whole day _long_ I held out my hands
to a disobedient and resistant people." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-65#v2|Isa 65:2]]]
