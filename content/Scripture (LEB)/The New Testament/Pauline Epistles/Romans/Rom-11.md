[[Rom-10|Previous Chapter]] | [[Rom-12|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Therefore I say, God has not rejected his people, has he? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here] May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, from the descendants of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

###### v2
God has not rejected his people, whom he foreknew! Or do you not know, in _the passage about_ ^[The words "the passage about" are not in the Greek text, but are supplied for clarity] Elijah, what the scripture says--how he appeals to God against Israel?

###### v3
"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life!" ^[A quotation from [[1 Kgs-19#v10|1 Kgs 19:10]], [[1 Kgs-19#v14|14]]]

###### v4
But what does the divine response say to him? "I have left for myself seven thousand people ^[Or perhaps "males," referring to men only] who have not bent the knee to Baal." ^[A quotation from [[1 Kgs-19#v18|1 Kgs 19:18]]]

###### v5
So in this way also at the present time, there is a remnant _selected by grace_ ^[Literally "according to selection of grace"].

###### v6
But if by grace, _it is_ no longer by works, for otherwise grace would no longer be grace.

###### v7
What then? What Israel was searching for, this it did not obtain. But the elect obtained _it_, and the rest were hardened,

###### v8
just as it is written,
"God gave them a spirit of stupor,
eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear,
until this very day." ^[A quotation from [[Deut-29#v4|Deut 29:4]]; [[Isa-29#v10|Isa 29:10]]]

###### v9
And David says,
"Let their table become a snare and a trap,
and a cause for stumbling and a retribution to them;

###### v10
let their eyes be darkened so that they do not see,
and cause their backs to bend _continually_ ^[Literally "throughout everything"]." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-69#v22|Ps 69:22–23]][[Ps-69#v23|]]]

###### v11
I say then, they did not stumble so that they fell, _did they_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here] May it never be! But by their trespass, salvation _has come_ to the Gentiles, in order to provoke them _to jealousy_. ^[*The words "to jealousy" are not in the Greek text, but are supplied for clarity]

###### v12
And if their trespass _means_ riches for the world and their loss _means_ riches for the Gentiles, how much more _will_ their fullness _mean_?

###### v13
Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Therefore, inasmuch as I am apostle to the Gentiles, I promote my ministry,

###### v14
if somehow I may provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them.

###### v15
For if their rejection _means_ the reconciliation of the world, what _will_ their acceptance _mean_ except life from the dead?

###### v16
Now if the first fruits _are_ holy, _so_ also _is_ the _whole_ batch of dough, and if the root _is_ holy, _so_ also _are_ the branches.

###### v17
Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, _although you_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as concessive] were a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the root of the olive tree's richness,

###### v18
do not boast against the branches. But if you boast against _them_, you do not support the root, but the root _supports_ you.

###### v19
Then you will say, "Branches were broken off in order that I could be grafted in."

###### v20
Well said! They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand firm because of faith. Do not think arrogant _thoughts_, but be afraid.

###### v21
For if God did not spare the _natural_ ^[Literally "according to nature"] branches, neither will he spare you. ^[Some manuscripts have "perhaps he will not spare you either"]

###### v22
See, then, the kindness and severity of God: severity upon those who have fallen, but upon you the kindness of God--if you continue in his kindness, for otherwise you also will be cut off.

###### v23
And those also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God is able to graft them in again.

###### v24
For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are _natural branches_ ^[Literally "by nature"] be grafted into their own olive tree?

###### v25
For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you will not be wise _in your own sight_, ^[Literally "in yourselves"] that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in,

###### v26
and so all Israel will be saved, just as it is written,
"The deliverer will come out of Zion;
he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.

###### v27
And this _is_ the covenant from me with them ^[A quotation from [[Isa-59#v20|Isa 59:20–21]][[Isa-59#v21|]]]
when I take away their sins." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-27#v9|Isa 27:9]]; [[Jer-31#v33|Jer 31:33–34]][[Jer-31#v34|]]]

###### v28
With respect to the gospel, _they are_ enemies for your sake, but with respect to election, _they are_ dearly loved for the sake of the fathers.

###### v29
For the gifts and the calling of God _are_ irrevocable.

###### v30
For just as you formerly were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of the disobedience of these,

###### v31
so also these have now been disobedient for your mercy, in order that they also may now be shown mercy.

###### v32
For God confined them all in disobedience, in order that he could have mercy on them all.

###### v33
Oh, the depth of the riches
and the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
How unsearchable _are_ his judgments
and _how_ incomprehensible _are_ his ways!

###### v34
"For who has known the mind of the Lord,
or who has been his counselor? ^[A quotation from [[Isa-40#v13|Isa 40:13]]]

###### v35
Or who has given in advance to him,
and it will be paid back to him?" ^[A quotation from [[Job-41#v11|Job 41:11]]]

###### v36
For from him and through him and to him _are_ all _things_.
To him _be_ glory for eternity! Amen.
