###### v1
Therefore I exhort you, brothers, through the mercies of God, to present your bodies _as_ a living sacrifice, holy _and_ pleasing to God, _which is_ your reasonable service.

###### v2
And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, so that you may approve what _is_ the good and well-pleasing and perfect will of God.

###### v3
For by the grace given to me I say to everyone who is among you not to think more highly of yourself than what one ought to think, but to think _sensibly_ ^[Literally "so as to be sensible"], as God has apportioned a measure of faith to each one.

###### v4
For just as in one body we have many members, but all the members do not have the same function,

###### v5
in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ, and _individually_ ^[Literally "with respect to one"] members of one another,

###### v6
but having different gifts according to the grace given to us: if _it is_ prophecy, according to the proportion of _his_ faith;

###### v7
if _it is_ service, by service; if _it is_ one who teaches, by teaching;

###### v8
if _it is_ one who exhorts, by exhortation; one who gives, with sincerity; one who leads, with diligence; one who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.

###### v9
Love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what _is_ evil; be attached to what _is_ good,

###### v10
being devoted to one another in brotherly love, esteeming one another _more highly_ in honor,

###### v11
not lagging in diligence, being enthusiastic in spirit, serving the Lord,

###### v12
rejoicing in hope, enduring in affliction, being devoted to prayer,

###### v13
contributing to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality.

###### v14
Bless those who persecute, ^[Some manuscripts have "who persecute you"] bless and do not curse _them_.

###### v15
Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.

###### v16
Think the same _thing_ toward one another; _do not think arrogantly_ ^[Literally "think not the arrogant"], but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise _in your own sight_ ^[Literally "in the sight of yourselves"].

###### v17
Pay back no one evil for evil. Take thought for _what is_ good in the sight of all people.

###### v18
If _it is_ possible on your _part_, be at peace with all people.

###### v19
Do not take revenge yourselves, dear friends, but give place to _God's_ wrath, for it is written, "Vengeance _is_ mine, I will repay," ^[A quotation from [[Deut-32#v35|Deut 32:35]]] says the Lord.

###### v20
But "if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him _something_ to drink; for _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("doing") which is understood as means] doing this, you will heap up coals of fire upon his head." ^[A quotation from [[Prov-25#v21|Prov 25:21–22]][[Prov-25#v22|]]]

###### v21
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
