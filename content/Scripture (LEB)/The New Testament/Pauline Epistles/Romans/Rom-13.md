###### v1
Let every person be subject to the governing authorities, for _there_ is no authority except by God, and those that exist are put in place by God.

###### v2
So then, the one who resists authority resists the ordinance _which is_ from God, and those who resist will receive condemnation on themselves.

###### v3
For rulers are not a _cause of_ terror for a good deed, but for bad _conduct_. So do you want not to be afraid of authority? Do what _is_ good, and you will have praise from it,

###### v4
for it is God's servant to you for what _is_ good. But if you do what _is_ bad, be afraid, because it does not bear the sword to no purpose. For it is God's servant, the one who avenges for punishment on the one who does _what is_ bad.

###### v5
Therefore _it is_ necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience.

###### v6
For because of this you also pay taxes, for _the authorities_ ^[Literally "they"] are servants of God, busily engaged in this very _thing_.

###### v7
Pay to everyone _what is_ owed: _pay_ taxes to whom taxes _are due_; _pay_ customs duties to whom customs duties _are due_; _pay_ respect to whom respect _is due_; _pay_ honor to whom honor _is due_. ^[Due to the very compressed style in this verse, many words must be supplied to make sense in English]

###### v8
Owe nothing to anyone, except to love one another, for the one who loves someone else has fulfilled the law.

###### v9
For the _commandments_, "You shall not commit adultery, you shall not commit murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet," ^[A quotation from [[Exod-20#v13|Exod 20:13–15]][[Exod-20#v14|]][[Exod-20#v15|]], [[Exod-20#v17|17]]; [[Deut-05#v17|Deut 5:17–19]][[Deut-05#v18|]][[Deut-05#v19|]], [[Deut-05#v21|21]]] and if _there is_ any other commandment, are summed up in this statement: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." ^[A quotation from [[Lev-19#v18|Lev 19:18]]]

###### v10
Love does not commit evil against a neighbor. Therefore love _is the_ fulfillment of the law.

###### v11
And _do_ this _because you_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal] know the time, that _it is_ already the hour for you to wake up from sleep. For our salvation _is_ nearer now than when we believed.

###### v12
The night is far gone, and the day has drawn near. Therefore let us throw off ^[Some manuscripts have "let us lay aside"] the deeds of darkness and put on the weapons of light.

###### v13
Let us live decently, as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and licentiousness, not in strife and jealousy.

###### v14
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not make provision for the desires of the flesh.
