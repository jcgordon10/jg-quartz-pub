###### v1
Now receive the one who is weak in faith, _but_ not for quarrels about opinions.

###### v2
One believes _he may_ eat all _things_, but the one who is weak eats _only_ vegetables.

###### v3
The one who eats must not despise the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat must not judge the one who eats, because God has accepted him.

###### v4
Who are you, who passes judgment on the domestic slave belonging to someone else? To his own master he stands or falls, and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.

###### v5
One person ^[Some manuscripts have "For one person"] prefers _one_ day over _another_ day, and another person regards every day _alike_. Each one must be fully convinced in his own mind.

###### v6
The one who is intent on the day is intent on _it_ for the Lord, and the one who eats eats for the Lord, because he is thankful to God, and the one who does not eat does not eat for the Lord, and he is thankful to God.

###### v7
For none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself.

###### v8
For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore whether we live _or_ whether we die, we are the Lord's.

###### v9
For Christ died and became alive again for this _reason_, in order that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.

###### v10
But why do you judge your brother? Or also, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.

###### v11
For it is written,
"As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to me,
and every tongue will praise God." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-45#v23|Isa 45:23]]]

###### v12
So ^[Some manuscripts have "So then,"] each one of us will give an account concerning himself. ^[Some manuscripts have "an account concerning himself to God"]

###### v13
Therefore, let us no longer pass judgment on one another, but rather decide this: not to place a cause for stumbling or a temptation before a brother.

###### v14
I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing _is_ unclean of itself, except to the one who considers something to be unclean; to that person _it is_ unclean.

###### v15
For if because of food, your brother is grieved, you are no longer living according to love. Do not destroy by your food that person for whom Christ died.

###### v16
Therefore do not let your good be slandered.

###### v17
For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

###### v18
For the one who serves Christ in this _way_ _is_ well-pleasing to God and approved by people.

###### v19
So then, let us pursue _what promotes peace_ ^[Literally "the things of peace"] and _what edifies one another_ ^[Literally "the things of edification toward one another"].

###### v20
Do not destroy the work of God on account of food. All _things_ _are_ clean, but _it is_ wrong for the person _who eats and stumbles in the process_ ^[Literally "who eats with stumbling"].

###### v21
_It is_ good not to eat meat or to drink wine or _to do anything_ by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is weakened. ^[Some manuscripts omit "or is offended or is weakened"]

###### v22
The faith that you have, have with respect to yourself before God. Blessed _is_ the one who does not pass judgment on himself by what he approves.

###### v23
But the one who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not _do so_ from faith, and everything that _is_ not from faith is sin.
