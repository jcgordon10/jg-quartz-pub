[[Rom-14|Previous Chapter]] | [[Rom-16|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
But we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves.

###### v2
Let each one of us please his neighbor for his good, for the purpose of edification.

###### v3
For even Christ did not please himself, but just as it is written, "The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-69#v9|Ps 69:9]]]

###### v4
For whatever was written beforehand was written for our instruction, in order that through patient endurance and through the encouragement of the scriptures we may have hope.

###### v5
Now may the God of patient endurance and of encouragement grant you _to be in agreement_ ^[Literally "to think the same"] with one another, in accordance with Christ Jesus,

###### v6
so that with one mind you may glorify with one mouth the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

###### v7
Therefore accept one another, just as Christ also has accepted you, to the glory of God.

###### v8
For I say, Christ has become a servant of the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God, in order to confirm the promises to the fathers,

###### v9
and that the Gentiles may glorify God for _his_ mercy, just as it is written,
"Because of this, I will praise you among the Gentiles,
and I will sing praise to your name." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-18#v49|Ps 18:49]]]

###### v10
And again it says,
"Rejoice, Gentiles, with his people." ^[A quotation from [[Deut-32#v43|Deut 32:43]]]

###### v11
And again,
"Praise the Lord, all the Gentiles,
and let all the peoples praise him." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-117#v1|Ps 117:1]]]

###### v12
And again Isaiah says,
"The root of Jesse will come,
even the one who rises to rule over the Gentiles;
in him the Gentiles will put their hope." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-11#v10|Isa 11:10]]]

###### v13
Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

###### v14
Now I myself also am convinced about you, my brothers, that _you_ yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to instruct one another.

###### v15
But I have written to you more boldly on _some_ points, so as to remind you _again_ because of the grace that has been given to me by God,

###### v16
with the result that I am a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving the gospel of God as a priest, in order that the offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

###### v17
Therefore I have a reason for boasting in Christ Jesus regarding the things concerning God.

###### v18
For I will not dare to speak about anything except _that_ which Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,

###### v19
by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit, ^[Some manuscripts have "of the Spirit of God"] so that from Jerusalem and _traveling_ around as far as Illyricum I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.

###### v20
And so, having as my ambition to proclaim the gospel where Christ has not been named, in order that I will not build on the foundation belonging to someone else,

###### v21
but just as it is written,
"_Those_ to whom _it was_ not announced concerning him will see,
and _those_ who have not heard will understand." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-52#v15|Isa 52:15]]]

###### v22
For this reason also I was hindered many _times_ from coming to you,

###### v23
and now, no longer having a place in these regions, but having a desire for many years to come to you

###### v24
whenever I travel to Spain. For I hope _while I_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("passing through") which is understood as temporal] am passing through to see you and to be sent on my way by you, whenever I have first enjoyed your _company_ for a while.

###### v25
But now I am traveling to Jerusalem, serving the saints.

###### v26
For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.

###### v27
For they were pleased _to do so_, and they are obligated to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual _things_, they ought also to serve them in material _things_.

###### v28
Therefore, _after I_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have accomplished") which is understood as temporal] have accomplished this and sealed this fruit _for delivery_ to them, I will depart by way of you for Spain,

###### v29
and I know that _when I_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("come") which is understood as temporal] come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.

###### v30
Now I exhort you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to contend along with me in your prayers on my behalf to God,

###### v31
that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and my ministry in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,

###### v32
so that, coming to you with joy by the will of God, I may rest with you.

###### v33
Now _may_ the God of peace _be_ with all of you. Amen.
