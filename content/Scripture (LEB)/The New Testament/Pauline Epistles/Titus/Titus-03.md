###### v1
Remind them to be subject to the rulers _and_ to the authorities, to obey, to be prepared for every good work,

###### v2
to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all courtesy to all people.

###### v3
For we also were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, enslaved to various desires and pleasures, spending our lives in wickedness and envy, despicable, hating one another.

###### v4
But when the kindness and love for mankind of God our Savior appeared,

###### v5
he saved us, not by deeds of righteousness that we have done, but because of his mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit,

###### v6
whom he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,

###### v7
so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

###### v8
The saying _is_ trustworthy, and I want you to insist concerning these _things_, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and beneficial for people.

###### v9
But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and contentions and quarrels about the law, for they are useless and fruitless.

###### v10
Reject a divisive person after a first and second admonition,

###### v11
knowing that such a person is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned.

###### v12
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make haste to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.

###### v13
Diligently send on their way Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, so that _they may lack nothing_ ^[Literally "nothing may lack to them"].

But also our _people_ must learn to engage in good deeds for necessary needs, so that they will not be unfruitful.

###### v15
All those with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace _be_ with all of you.
