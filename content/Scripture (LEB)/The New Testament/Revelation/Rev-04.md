###### v1
After these _things_ I looked, and behold, an open door in heaven, and the former voice that I had heard like a trumpet speaking with me was saying, "Come up here and I will show you _the things_ which must take place after these _things_."

###### v2
Immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one was seated on the throne.

###### v3
And the one seated _was_ similar in appearance to jasper and carnelian stone, and a rainbow _was_ around the throne similar in appearance to emerald.

###### v4
And around the throne _were_ twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones _were_ twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing, and on their heads _were_ gold crowns.

###### v5
And from the throne came out lightnings and sounds and thunders, and seven torches of fire _were_ burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.

###### v6
And before the throne _was something_ like a sea of glass, like crystal, and in the midst of the throne and around the throne _were_ four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.

###### v7
And the first living creature _was_ similar to a lion, and the second living creature _was_ similar to an ox, and the third living creature had a face like a man's, and the fourth living creature _was_ similar to an eagle flying.

###### v8
And the four living creatures, _each one_ ^[Literally "one by one"] of them, had six wings apiece, full of eyes around and inside, and they do not have rest day and night, saying,
"Holy, holy, holy _is_ the Lord God All-Powerful, ^[A quotation from (or an allusion to) [[Isa-06#v3|Isa 6:3]]]
the one who was and the one who is and the one who is coming!"

###### v9
And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who is seated on the throne, the one who lives _forever and ever_ ^[Literally "for the ages of the ages"],

###### v10
the twenty-four elders fall down before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives _forever and ever_ ^[Literally "for the ages of the ages"], and put down their crowns before the throne, saying,

###### v11
"You are worthy, our Lord and God,
to receive glory and honor and power,
because you have created all _things_,
and because of your will they existed and were created."
