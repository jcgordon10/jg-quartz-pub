###### v1
And I watched when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying like the sound of thunder, "Come!"

###### v2
And I looked, and behold, a white horse, and the one seated on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and in order that he might conquer.

###### v3
And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, "Come!"

###### v4
And another horse came out, fiery red, and it was granted to the one seated on it to take peace from the earth, and that they would slaughter one another, and a large sword was given to him.

###### v5
And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, "Come!" And I looked, and behold, a black horse, and the one seated on it had a balance scale in his hand.

###### v6
And I heard _something_ like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not damage the olive oil and the wine!"

###### v7
And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard a voice from the fourth living creature saying, "Come!"

###### v8
And I looked, and behold, a pale green horse, and the one seated on it _was named_ ^[Literally "name to him"] Death, and Hades followed after him. And authority was granted to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill by the sword and by famine and by pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.

###### v9
And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had,

###### v10
and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, "_How long_ ^[Literally "until when"], holy and true Lord, will you not judge and avenge our blood from those who live on the earth?"

###### v11
And to each one of them a white robe was given, and it was said to them that they should rest yet a short time, until _the number of_ their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed as they _had been_ were completed also.

###### v12
And I watched when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake took place, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood,

###### v13
and the stars of heaven ^[Or "of the sky"] fell to the earth like a fig tree throws down its unripe figs _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("shaken") which is understood as temporal] shaken by a great wind.

###### v14
And the sky was split apart like a scroll that is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved from their place.

###### v15
And the kings of the earth, and the most important people, and the military leaders, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains,

###### v16
And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,

###### v17
because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?"
