###### v1
And the fifth angel blew the trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth, and the key of the shaft of the abyss was given to him.

###### v2
And he opened the shaft of the abyss, and smoke went up from the shaft like smoke from a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the shaft.

###### v3
And out of the smoke locusts came to the earth, and power was given to them like the scorpions of the earth have power.

###### v4
And it was told to them that they should not damage the grass of the earth or any green _plant_ or any tree, except those people who do not have the seal of God on their ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] foreheads.

###### v5
And it was granted to them that they should not kill them, but that they would be tormented five months, and their torment _is_ like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a person.

###### v6
And in those days people will seek death and will never find it, and they will long to die, and death will flee from them.

###### v7
And the appearance of the locusts _was_ like horses prepared for battle, and on their heads _were something_ like crowns similar in appearance to gold, and their faces _were_ like men's faces,

###### v8
and they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like _the teeth_ of lions,

###### v9
and they had breastplates like iron breastplates, and the sound of their wings _was_ like the sound of many _horse-drawn chariots_ ^[Literally "chariots of horses"] running into battle.

###### v10
And they have tails similar in appearance to scorpions, and stings, and their power to injure people _for_ five months _is_ in their tails.

###### v11
They have _as_ king over them the angel of the abyss, _whose name_ ^[Literally "the name to him"] in Hebrew _is_ Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.

###### v12
The first woe has passed. Behold, two woes are still coming after these _things_.

###### v13
And the sixth angel blew the trumpet, and I heard one voice from the horns ^[Some manuscripts have "four horns"] of the golden altar _that is_ before God

###### v14
saying to the sixth angel, the one who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who have been bound at the great river Euphrates!"

###### v15
And the four angels who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year were released, in order that they should kill a third of humanity.

###### v16
And the number of the troops of the cavalry _was_ _two hundred million_ ^[Literally "twenty thousands of ten thousands"]; I heard the number of them.

###### v17
And in this way I saw the horses in the vision, and those seated on them, who had fiery _red_ and hyacinth-colored and sulphurous _yellow_ breastplates, and the heads of the horses _were_ like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and sulphur.

###### v18
By these three plagues a third of humanity was killed--by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur that came out of their mouths.

###### v19
For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails _are_ similar in appearance to snakes, having heads, and with them they cause injury. ^[Literally "they injure"]

###### v20
And the rest of humanity who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands, _in order not to worship_ ^[Literally "so that they did not worship"] the demons and the gold and silver and bronze and stone and wooden idols, which are able neither to see nor to hear nor to walk,

###### v21
and they did not repent of their murders or of their magic spells or of their sexual immorality or of their thefts.
