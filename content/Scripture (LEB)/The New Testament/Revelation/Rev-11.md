###### v3
And I will grant _authority_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy _for one_ thousand two hundred sixty days, dressed in sackcloth."

###### v4

###### v5

###### v6
These have the authority to shut the sky, so that _it does not rain_ ^[Literally "it does not rain rain"; the redundancy is removed in the translation] during the days of their prophecy.

The second woe has passed. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly!

###### v15
And the seventh angel blew the trumpet, and there was a loud voice in heaven saying,
"The kingdom of the world has become _the kingdom_ of our Lord
and of his Christ,
and he will reign _forever and ever_ ^[Literally "for the ages of the ages"]."

###### v16
And the twenty-four elders _who are_ seated on their thrones before God fell down on their faces and worshiped God,

###### v17
saying,
"We give thanks to you, Lord God All-Powerful,
the one who is and the one who was,
because you have taken your great power
and have begun to reign.

###### v18
And the nations were angry,
and your wrath has come,
and the time for the dead to be judged,
and to give their ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] reward to your slaves the prophets
and to the saints and to the ones who fear your name,
the small and the great,
and to destroy those who destroy the earth."

###### v19
And the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant appeared in his temple, and there were lightnings and sounds and thunders and an earthquake and large hail. ^[Or "a great hailstorm"]
