###### v2
and _who was pregnant_ ^[Literally "who was having in the belly"] and was crying out _because she_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was having birth pains") which is understood as causal] was having birth pains, and was in torment to give birth.

###### v4
And his tail swept away a third of the stars from heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, in order that whenever she gave birth to her child he could devour _it_.

###### v5
And she gave birth to a son, a male _child_, who is going to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod, ^[An allusion to [[Ps-02#v9|Ps 2:9]]] and her child was snatched away to God and to his throne.

###### v6
And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared there by God, so that they could feed her there _for one_ thousand two hundred sixty days.

###### v8
And they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them _any_ longer in heaven.

###### v9
And the great dragon was thrown down, the ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.

###### v10
And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying,
"Now the salvation and the power
and the kingdom of our God
and the authority of his Christ have come,
because the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down,
the one who accuses them before our God day and night.

###### v11
And they conquered him by the blood of the Lamb
and by the word of their testimony,
and they did not love their lives until death.

###### v12
Because of this, rejoice, you heavens,
and those who live in them!
Woe _to_ the earth and _to_ the sea,
because the devil has come down to you,
having great anger,
_because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("knows") which is understood as causal] knows that he has little time!"

###### v13
And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male _child_.

And from his mouth the serpent spouted water like a river after the woman, in order that he could make her swept away by a river.

###### v16
And the earth came to the aid of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had spouted out of his mouth.
