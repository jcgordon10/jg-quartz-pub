###### v1
And I saw coming up out of the sea a beast that had ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns ten royal headbands, ^[Or "ten diadem crowns"] and on its heads a blasphemous name. ^[Some manuscripts read "blasphemous names"]

###### v2
And the beast that I saw was similar to a leopard, and its feet _were_ like a bear's, and its mouth _was_ like the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority.

###### v3
And one of its heads _appeared_ as though slaughtered to death, and its _fatal wound_ ^[Literally "wound of death"] had been healed. And the whole earth was astonished _and followed_ after the beast.

###### v4
And they worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who _is_ like the beast, and who is able to make war with him?

###### v5
And a mouth was given to him speaking great _things_ and blasphemies, and authority to act was given to him _for_ forty-two months.

###### v6
And he opened his mouth for blasphemies toward God, to blaspheme his name and his dwelling, those who live in heaven.

###### v7
And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given to him over every tribe and people and language and nation.

###### v8
And all those who live on the earth will worship him, _everyone whose name is not written_ ^[Literally "of whom his name is not written"] from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slaughtered.

###### v9
If anyone has an ear, let him hear!

###### v10
If anyone _is going_ into captivity, into captivity he goes.
If anyone _is_ to be killed by the sword, by the sword he _is_ to be killed.
Here is the patient endurance and the faith of the saints.

###### v11
And I saw another beast coming up from the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he was speaking like a dragon.

###### v12
And he exercises all the authority of the first beast on behalf of him, and he causes the earth and those who live in it to worship the first beast _whose fatal wound had been healed_ ^[Literally "of whom the wound of his death had been healed"].

###### v13
And he performs great signs, so that he even causes fire from heaven to come down to the earth before people.

###### v14
And he deceives those who live on the earth because of the signs that it has been granted to him to perform on behalf of the beast, telling those who live on the earth to make an image to the beast who has the wound of the sword and _yet_ lived.

###### v15
And it was given to him to put breath into the image of the beast, in order that the image of the beast both spoke and caused that all those, unless they worshiped the image of the beast, should be killed.

###### v16
And he causes all _people_, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, that they give them a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,

###### v17
and that no one was able to buy or to sell except the one who had the mark--the name of the beast or the number of his name.

###### v18
Here is wisdom: the one who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number, ^[Or "it is _the_ number of _a_ man"] and his number _is_ six hundred sixty-six. ^[A few significant manuscripts read "six hundred sixteen"]
