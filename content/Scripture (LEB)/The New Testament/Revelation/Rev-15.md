[[Rev-14|Previous Chapter]] | [[Rev-16|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
And I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven: seven angels having seven plagues _that are_ the last _ones_, because with them the wrath of God is completed.

###### v2
And I saw _something_ like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had conquered the beast and his image and the number of his name were standing by ^[Or "on"; or "at"; or "near"] the glassy sea, holding harps from God.

###### v3
And they were singing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying:
"Great and marvelous _are_ your works,
Lord God All-Powerful;
righteous and true _are_ your ways,
King of the ages! ^[Some manuscripts have "nations"]

###### v4
Who would never fear, Lord,
and glorify your name?
For only you _are_ holy,
because all the nations ^[Or "Gentiles"; the same Greek word can be translated "nations" or "Gentiles" depending on the context] will come
and worship before you,
because your righteous deeds have been revealed."

###### v5
And after these _things_ I looked, and the temple, the tent of the testimony in heaven, was opened,

###### v6
and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out from the temple, dressed _in_ clean, bright linen garments, and girded with golden belts around their ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] chests.

###### v7
And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives _forever and ever_ ^[Literally "for the ages of the ages"],

###### v8
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
