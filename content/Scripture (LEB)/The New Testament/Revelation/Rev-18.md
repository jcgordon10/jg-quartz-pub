###### v1
After these _things_ I saw another angel descending from heaven, who had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.

###### v2
And he cried out with a powerful voice, saying,
"Fallen, fallen _is_ Babylon the great,
and it has become a dwelling place of demons
and a haunt of every unclean spirit
and a haunt of every unclean bird
and a haunt of every unclean and detested animal.

###### v3
For all the nations have drunk ^[Some of the best manuscripts read "have fallen"]
from the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality,
and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her,
and the merchants of the earth have become rich
from the power of her sensuality."

###### v4
And I heard another voice from heaven saying,
"Come out from her, my people,
so that you will not participate in her sins,
and so that you will not receive her plagues,

###### v5
because her sins have reached up to heaven,
and God has remembered her crimes.

###### v6
Pay back to her as she herself also paid out,
and _pay back double_ ^[Literally "double twofold"] according to her deeds;
in the cup that she mixed, mix double for her.

###### v7
As much as she glorified herself and lived in luxury,
give to her so much torment and mourning,
because in her heart she said,
'I sit as a queen, and am not a widow,
and I will never see mourning!'

###### v8
Because of this her plagues will come in one day--
death and mourning and famine--
and she will be burned up with fire,
because the Lord God who passes judgment on her _is_ powerful!"

###### v9
And the kings of the earth will weep and mourn over her, those who committed sexual immorality and lived sensually with her, when they see the smoke of her burning,

###### v10
standing _far off_ ^[Literally "from afar"] because of the fear of her torment, saying,
"Woe, woe, the great city,
Babylon the powerful city,
because in one hour your judgment has come!"

###### v11
And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo any more--

###### v12
cargo of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple cloth and silk and scarlet cloth and all kinds of scented wood and all kinds of ivory goods and all kinds of goods of precious wood and bronze and iron and marble

###### v13
and cinnamon and amomum ^[Or "spice"; the term can refer to "spice" in general, or specifically to _amomum_, a spice from India] and incense and ointment and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine wheat flour and wheat and domesticated animals and sheep and horses and carriages and _slaves_ ^[Literally "bodies"] and human lives.

###### v14
"And _the fruit your soul desires_ ^[Literally "your fruit of desire"] has departed from you,
and all the luxury and the splendor has perished from you,
and they will never find them any more."

###### v15
The merchants of these _things_, who became rich from them, will stand _far off_ ^[Literally "from afar"], weeping and mourning because of the fear of her torment,

###### v16
saying,
"Woe, woe, the great city,
dressed in fine linen and purple cloth and scarlet cloth,
and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls,

###### v17
because in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!"
And every shipmaster and _every seafarer_ ^[Literally "everyone who sails to a place"] and sailors and all those who labor on the sea stood _far off_ ^[Literally "from afar"]

###### v18
and began to cry out _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw the smoke of her burning, saying, "Who _is_ like the great city?"

###### v19
And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying,
"Woe, woe, the great city,
in which all those who had ships on the sea
became rich from her prosperity,
because in one hour she has been laid waste!"

###### v20
Rejoice over her, heaven
and the saints and the apostles and the prophets,
because God has pronounced your judgment on her!"

###### v21
And one powerful angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw _it_ into the sea, saying,
"In this way Babylon the great city will be thrown down with violence,
and will never be found again!

###### v22
And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute players and trumpeters
will never be heard in you again!
And every craftsman of every trade
will never be found in you again!
And the sound of a mill
will never be heard in you again!

###### v23
And the light of a lamp
will never shine in you again!
And the sound of a bridegroom and bride
will never be heard in you again!
For your merchants were the most important people of the earth,
because with your sorcery they deceived all the nations.

###### v24
And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints
and all those who had been slaughtered on the earth.
