###### v1
After these _things_ I heard _something_ like the loud sound of a great crowd in heaven saying,
"Hallelujah!
Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,

###### v2
    because his judgments _are_ true and righteous,
because he has passed judgment on the great prostitute
who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality,
and has avenged the blood of his slaves _shed by_ ^[Literally "from"] her hand!"

###### v3
And a second time they said,
"Hallelujah!"
And her smoke goes up _forever and ever_ ^[Literally "for the ages of the ages"].

###### v4
And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying,
"Amen! Hallelujah!"

###### v5
And a voice came out from the throne, saying,
"Praise our God
all his slaves,
and those who fear him,
the small and the great!"

###### v6
And I heard _something_ like the sound of a great crowd and _something_ like the sound of many waters and _something_ like the sound of powerful thunder, saying,
"Hallelujah!
For the Lord God, ^[Some manuscripts have "the Lord our God, the All-Powerful"] the All-Powerful, reigns!

###### v7
Let us rejoice and be glad
and give him the glory,
because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come,
and his bride has prepared herself.

###### v8
And it has been granted to her that she be dressed in bright, clean fine linen (for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints).

###### v9
And he said to me, "Write: Blessed _are_ those who are invited to the banquet of the wedding celebration of the Lamb!" And he said to me, "These are the true words of God."

###### v10
And I fell down before his feet to worship him, and he said to me, "_Do not do that!_ ^[Literally "do not see to it"] I am a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."

###### v11
And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and the one seated on it was called "Faithful" and "True," and with justice ^[Or "in righteousness"] he judges and makes war.

###### v12
Now his eyes _were_ a flame of fire, and on his head _were_ many royal headbands having a name written that no one except he himself knows.

###### v13
And _he was_ dressed in an outer garment dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.

###### v14
And the armies _that are_ in heaven, dressed in clean, white fine linen, were following him on white horses.

###### v15
And out of his mouth came a sharp sword, so that with it he could strike the nations. And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, ^[An allusion to [[Ps-02#v9|Ps 2:9]]] and he stomps the winepress of the wine of the furious wrath of God, the All-Powerful.

###### v16
And he has a name written on his outer garment and on his thigh: "King of kings and Lord of lords."

###### v17
And I saw one angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly _directly overhead_ ^[Literally, "in midheaven"],
"Come! Assemble for the great banquet of God,

###### v18
in order that you may eat the flesh of kings,
and the flesh of military tribunes,
and the flesh of the powerful,
and the flesh of horses and those seated on them,
and the flesh of all _people_,
both free and slave,
and small and great!"

###### v19
And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war with the one who is seated on the horse and with his army.

###### v20
And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs before him, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who had worshiped his image. The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulphur.

###### v21
And the rest were killed by the sword of the one who is seated on the horse--the _sword_ that comes out of his mouth--and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
