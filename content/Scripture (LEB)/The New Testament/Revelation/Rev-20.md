[[Rev-19|Previous Chapter]] | [[Rev-21|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
And I saw an angel descending from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.

###### v2
And he seized the dragon--the ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan--and bound him _for_ a thousand years,

###### v3
and threw him into the abyss, and shut _it_ and sealed _it_ above him, in order that he could not deceive the nations again until the thousand years are completed. After these _things_ it is necessary _for_ him to be released _for_ a short time.

###### v4
And I saw thrones, and they sat down on them, and authority to judge was granted to them. And _I saw_ the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and did not receive the mark on their ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] forehead and on their hand, and they came to life and reigned with Christ _for_ a thousand years.

###### v5
(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed.) This _is_ the first resurrection.

###### v6
Blessed and holy _is_ the one who has a part in the first resurrection. Over this person the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him a thousand ^[Some manuscripts have "_for_ the thousand"] years.

###### v7
And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison

###### v8
and he will go out to deceive the nations _that are_ at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to assemble them for battle, _whose number_ ^[Literally "of whom the number of them"] _is_ like the sand of the sea.

###### v9
And they went up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the fortified camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and consumed them.

###### v10
And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the beast and the false prophet also _are_, and they will be tormented day and night _forever and ever_ ^[Literally "for the ages of the ages"].

###### v11
And I saw a great white throne and the one who was seated on it, _from whose presence_ ^[Literally "from the presence of whom"] earth and heaven fled, and a place was not found for them.

###### v12
And I saw the dead--the great and the small--standing before the throne, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the _book_ of life, and the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to their deeds.

###### v13
And the sea gave up the dead _who were_ in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead _who were_ in them, and each one was judged according to their deeds.

###### v14
And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death--the lake of fire.

###### v15
And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
