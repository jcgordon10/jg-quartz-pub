[[Rev-20|Previous Chapter]] | [[Rev-22|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea did not exist _any_ longer.

###### v2
And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.

###### v3
And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
"Behold, the dwelling of God _is_ with humanity,
and he will take up residence with them,
and they will be his people
and God himself will be with them. ^[Some manuscripts have "with them _as_ their God"]

###### v4
And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes,
and death will not exist _any_ longer,
and ^[Literally "or"] mourning or wailing or pain will not exist _any_ longer.
The former _things_ ^[Some manuscripts have "any longer, because the former _things_"] have passed away."

###### v5
And the one seated on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all _things_ new!" And he said, "Write, because these words are faithful and true."

###### v6
And he said to me, "It is done! I _am_ ^[Some manuscripts explicitly state "am"] the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the one who is thirsty I will give _water_ from the spring of the water of life freely. ^[Or "without charge"]

###### v7
The one who conquers will inherit these _things_, and I will be _his God_ ^[Literally "to him God"] and he will be _my son_ ^[Literally "to me a son"].

###### v8
But _as_ for the cowards and unbelievers and detestable persons and murderers and sexually immoral people and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their share _is_ in the lake that burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second death.

###### v9
And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."

###### v10
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and lofty mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,

###### v11
that has the glory of God. Its radiance _is_ like a precious stone, _something_ like a jasper stone, shining like crystal.

###### v12
It has ^[Literally "having," referring back to the city mentioned in v. [[Rev-21#v11|11]]] a great and high wall that has twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on _the gates_ which are ^[Some manuscripts have "which are the names"] of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel--

###### v13
on the east, three gates, and on the north, three gates, and on the south, three gates, and on the west, three gates.

###### v14
And the wall of the city has twelve foundations, and on them _are_ twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

###### v15
And the one who spoke with me was holding a golden measuring rod in order that he could measure the city and its gates and its wall.

###### v16
And the city is laid out as a square, and its length is the same as _its_ width. And he measured the city with the measuring rod at twelve thousand stadia; ^[Or "two thousand two hundred kilometers"; or "fourteen hundred miles" (a _stade_ was a unit of length about 185 meters or 607 feet)] the length and the width and the height of it are equal.

###### v17
And he measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits ^[This number in cubits amounts to 12 times 12; it would be about 65 meters (216 feet)] _according to human measure_ ^[Literally "according to the measure of a man"], which is the angel's.

###### v18
And the material of its wall _is_ jasper, and the city _is_ pure gold, similar in appearance to pure glass.

###### v19
The foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every kind of precious stone: the first foundation jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,

###### v20
the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.

###### v21
And the twelve gates _are_ twelve pearls, each one of the gates was from a single pearl. And the street of the city _is_ pure gold, like transparent glass.

###### v22
And I did not see a temple in it, for the Lord God All-Powerful is its temple, and the Lamb.

###### v23
And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon, that they shine on it, for the glory of God illuminates it, and its lamp _is_ the Lamb.

###### v24
And the nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.

###### v25
And its gates will never be shut by day (for there will be no night there),

###### v26
and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.

###### v27
And every unclean thing and one who practices ^[Some manuscripts have "and the one who practices"] detestable things and falsehood will never enter into it, except those who are written in the book of life of the Lamb.
