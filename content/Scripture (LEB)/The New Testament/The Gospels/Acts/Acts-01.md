###### v1
I produced the former account, O Theophilus, about all _that_ ^[Literally "of what"] Jesus began to do and to teach,

###### v2
until the day he was taken up, _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had given orders") which is understood as temporal] had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen,

###### v3
to whom he also presented himself alive after he suffered, with many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking the things about the kingdom of God.

###### v4
And _while he_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was with") which is understood as temporal] was with ^[Or "was assembling with," or "was sharing a meal with"] _them_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] he commanded them, "Do not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for what was promised by the Father, which you heard about from me.

###### v5
For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit _not many days from now_." ^[Literally "not many days after these"]

###### v6
So _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had come together") which is understood as temporal] they had come together, they began asking ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began asking")] him, saying, "Lord, _is it_ at this time you are restoring the kingdom to Israel?"

###### v7
But he said to them, "It is not for you to know _the_ times or seasons that the Father has set by his own authority.

###### v8
But you will receive power _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("has come")] the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the farthest part of the earth."

###### v9
And _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had said") which is understood as temporal] had said these _things_, _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were watching")] they were watching, he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their sight.

###### v10
And as they were staring into the sky _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was departing")] he was departing, behold, two men in white clothing stood by them

###### v11
who also said, "Men _of Galilee_, ^[Literally "Galileans"] why do you stand there looking ^[Some manuscripts have "gazing"] into the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven like this will come back in the same way you saw him departing into heaven!"

###### v12
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain that is called Olive Grove ^[This is a variation of the name "Mount of Olives"] which is near Jerusalem, _a Sabbath day's journey away_. ^[Literally "having a journey of a Sabbath"]

###### v13
And when they had entered, they went up to the upstairs room where they were staying--Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James _son_ of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas _son_ of James.

###### v14
All these were busily engaged with one mind in prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with ^[Some manuscripts omit "with"] his brothers.

###### v15
And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (and it was a crowd of persons of about one hundred twenty at the same _place_) _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("stood up") has been translated as a finite verb] said,

###### v16
"Men _and_ brothers, it was necessary _that_ the scripture be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit proclaimed beforehand through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus,

###### v17
because he was counted among us and received a share in this ministry."

###### v18
(Now this man acquired a field for the wages of _his_ wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out.

###### v19
And it became known to all who live in Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language ^[That is, Aramaic] "Akeldama," that is, "Field of Blood.")

###### v20
"For it is written in the book of Psalms,
'Let his residence become deserted,
and let there be no one to live in it,' ^[A quotation from [[Ps-69#v25|Ps 69:25]]]
and,
'Let another person take his position.' ^[A quotation from [[Ps-109#v8|Ps 109:8]]]

###### v21
Therefore it is necessary for _one_ of the men who have accompanied us during all the time _in_ which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,

###### v22
beginning from the baptism of John until the day _on_ which he was taken up from us--one of these _men_ must become a witness of his resurrection together with us."

###### v23
And they proposed two _men_, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was called Justus) and Matthias.

###### v24
And they prayed _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("prayed") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show clearly which one of these two you have chosen

###### v25
to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to depart to his own place."

###### v26
And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was added _to serve_ ^[The words "_to serve_" are not in the Greek text, but are implied] with the eleven apostles.
