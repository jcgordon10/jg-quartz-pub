###### v2
and he kept back for himself _some_ of the proceeds, and _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] wife was aware of _it_. ^[*Here the participle "was aware of" in this genitive absolute construction has been translated as a finite verb in keeping with English style] And he brought a certain part _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("brought") has been translated as a finite verb] placed _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] at the feet of the apostles.

###### v3
But Peter said, "Ananias, for what _reason_ has Satan filled your heart, _that_ you lied to the Holy Spirit and kept back for yourself _some_ of the proceeds of the piece of land?

_When it_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("remained") which is understood as temporal] remained to you, did it not remain _yours_? And _when it_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was sold") which is understood as temporal] was sold, was it at your disposal?

And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] Ananias heard these words, he fell down _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("fell down") has been translated as a finite verb] died.

So Peter _said_ to her, "How _is it_ that it was agreed by you _two_ ^[Here "_two_" is supplied in the translation to indicate that the pronoun ("you") is plural in the Greek text] to test the Spirit of the Lord?

so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and put _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] on cots and mats ^[Or "mattresses"] so that _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("came by")] Peter came by, at least _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] shadow would fall on some of them.
