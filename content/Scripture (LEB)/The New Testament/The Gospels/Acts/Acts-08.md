But Saul was attempting to destroy the church.

They were all paying attention to _him_, ^[Literally "whom"] from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the power of God that is called 'Great.'"

###### v11
And they were paying attention to him because for a long time he had astonished them with _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] magic.

###### v12
But when they believed Philip _as he_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was proclaiming the good news") which is understood as temporal] was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were being baptized.

###### v13
And Simon himself also believed, and _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was baptized") which is understood as temporal] was baptized he was _keeping close company with_ ^[Literally "attaching himself to"] Philip.

###### v20

###### v28
and was returning and sitting in his chariot, and reading aloud the prophet Isaiah.

###### v29

###### v30
So Philip ran up to _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("ran up to") has been translated as a finite verb] heard him reading aloud Isaiah the prophet and said, "So then, do you understand what you are reading?"

###### v31

###### v32
Now the passage of scripture that he was reading aloud was this:
"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,
and like a lamb before its shearer _is_ silent,
so he did not open his mouth.

###### v33
    In his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] humiliation justice was taken from him.
Who can describe his _descendants_? ^[Or perhaps "family history"; literally "generation"]
For his life was taken away from the earth." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-53#v7|Isa 53:7–8]][[Isa-53#v8|]]]

###### v34
And the eunuch answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to Philip, "I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this--about himself or about someone else?"

So Philip opened his mouth and beginning from this scripture, proclaimed the good news to him _about_ Jesus.

###### v36
And as they were traveling down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, "Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?" ^[A few later manuscripts add v. [[Acts-08#v37|37]], with minor variations: "He said to him, 'If you believe with your whole heart, you may.' And he answered and said, 'I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.'" The verse is almost certainly not an original part of the text of Acts.]

###### v37

###### v38
And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water--Philip and the eunuch--and he baptized him.
