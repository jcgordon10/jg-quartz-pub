###### v1
Now _there was_ a certain man in Caesarea _named_ ^[Literally "by name"] Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Cohort,

###### v2
devout and fearing God together with all his household, doing many charitable deeds for the people and praying to God _continually_. ^[Literally "through everything"]

###### v3
About the ninth hour of the day, he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, "Cornelius."

###### v4
And he stared at him and became terrified _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("became") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "What is _it_, Lord?" And he said to him, "Your prayers and your charitable deeds have gone up for a memorial offering before God.

###### v5
And now, send men to Joppa and summon a certain Simon, who is also called Peter.

###### v6
This man is staying as a guest with a certain Simon, a tanner, ^[Or "with a certain Simon Berseus"; most modern English versions treat the word as Simon's profession ("Simon the tanner"), but the word may actually be a surname ("Simon Berseus" or "Simon Tanner")] whose house is by the sea."

###### v7
And when the angel who spoke to him departed, he summoned two of the household slaves and a devout soldier from those who attended him,

###### v8
and _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had explained") which is understood as temporal] had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.

###### v9
And the next day, _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were on their way")] they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray _at_ about the sixth hour.

###### v10
And he became hungry and wanted to eat. But _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were preparing")] they were preparing _the food_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] a trance came over him.

###### v11
And he saw heaven opened and an object something like a large sheet coming down, being let down to the earth by its four corners,

###### v12
in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the sky.

###### v13
And a voice came to him, "Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!"

###### v14
But Peter said, "Certainly not, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common and unclean!"

###### v15
And the voice _came_ again to him for the second time: "_The things_ which God has made clean, you must not consider unclean!"

###### v16
And this happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into heaven.

###### v17
Now while Peter was greatly perplexed within himself _as to_ what the vision that he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having found the house of Simon by asking around, stood at the gate.

###### v18
And they called out _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("called out") has been translated as a finite verb] asked if Simon who was also called Peter was staying there as a guest.

###### v19
And _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was reflecting")] Peter was reflecting about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, men ^[Some manuscripts have "three men"] are looking for you.

###### v20
But get up, go down, and go with them--not hesitating at all, because I have sent them."

###### v21
So Peter went down to the men _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went down") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Behold, I am _he_ whom you are looking for! What _is_ the reason for which you have come?"

###### v22
And they said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man--and well spoken of by the whole nation of the Jews--was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear words from you."

###### v23
So he invited them in _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("invited … in") has been translated as a finite verb] entertained them as guests, and on the next day he got up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("got up") has been translated as a finite verb] went away with them. And some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.

###### v24
And on the next day he entered into Caesarea.
Now Cornelius was waiting for them, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("waiting for") has been translated as a finite verb] had called together his relatives and close friends.

###### v25
So it happened that when Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] feet, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("fell") has been translated as a finite verb] worshiped _him_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v26
But Peter helped him up, saying, "Get up! I myself am also a man!"

###### v27
And _as he_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("conversed with") which is understood as temporal] conversed with him, he went in and found many _people_ gathered.

###### v28
And he said to them, "You know that it is forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or to approach a foreigner. And to me God has shown _that_ I should call no man common or unclean.

###### v29
Therefore--and without raising any objection--I came _when I_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was sent for") which is understood as temporal] was sent for. So I ask for what reason you sent for me."

###### v30
And Cornelius said, "_Four days ago at this hour_, ^[Literally "from the fourth day until this hour"] _the_ ninth, I was praying in my house. And behold, a man in shining clothing stood before me

###### v31
and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your charitable deeds have been remembered before God.

###### v32
Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon who is also called Peter. This man is staying as a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, ^[Or "of Simon Berseus"; most modern English versions treat the word as Simon's profession ("Simon the tanner"), but the word may actually be a surname ("Simon Berseus" or "Simon Tanner")] by the sea.

###### v33
Therefore I sent for you at once, and you _were kind enough to come_. ^[Literally "have done rightly coming"] So now we all are present before God to hear all the things that have been commanded to you by the Lord."

###### v34
So Peter opened _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] mouth _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("opened") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "In truth I understand that God is not one who shows partiality,

###### v35
but in every nation the one who fears him and who does what is right is acceptable to him.

###### v36
_As for_ ^[The words "_As for_" are not in the Greek text, but are supplied in the translation in keeping with English style] the message that he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ--this one is Lord of all--

###### v37
you know the thing that happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism that John proclaimed:

###### v38
Jesus of Nazareth--how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him.

###### v39
And we _are_ witnesses of all _the things_ that he did both in the land of the Judeans and in Jerusalem, whom they also executed _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("hanging") which is understood as means] hanging _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] on a tree.

###### v40
God raised this one up on the third day and granted _that_ he should become visible,

###### v41
not to all the people but to us who had been chosen beforehand by God _as_ witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.

###### v42
And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify solemnly that this one is the one appointed ^[Or "one who is designated"] by God _as_ judge of the living and of the dead.

###### v43
To this one all the prophets testify, _that_ through his name everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins."

###### v44
_While_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was … speaking")] Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who were listening to the message.

###### v45
And those believers from the circumcision who had accompanied Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles,

###### v46
for they heard them speaking in tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter said,

###### v47
"Surely no one can withhold the water for these _people_ to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did!"

###### v48
So he ordered _that_ they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days.
