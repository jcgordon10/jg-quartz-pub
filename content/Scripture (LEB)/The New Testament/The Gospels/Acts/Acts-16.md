###### v3
Paul wanted this one to go with him, and he took _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took") has been translated as a finite verb] circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for _they_ all knew that his father was Greek.

###### v4

And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came") which is understood as temporal] came to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.

###### v9
And a vision appeared to Paul during the night: a certain Macedonian man was standing there and imploring him and saying, "Come over to Macedonia _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("come over") has been translated as a finite verb] help us!"

###### v10
And when he had seen the vision, we wanted at once to go away to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them.

###### v11
So putting out to sea from Troas, we sailed a straight course to Samothrace, and on the following _day_ to Neapolis,

###### v12
and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city _of that_ district of Macedonia, a _Roman_ colony. And we were staying in this city for some days.

###### v13
And on the day of the Sabbath, we went outside the _city_ gate beside the river, where we thought there was a place of prayer, and we sat down _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("sat down") has been translated as a finite verb] spoke to the women assembled _there_.

###### v14
And a certain woman _named_ ^[Literally "by name"] Lydia from the city of Thyatira, a merchant dealing in purple cloth who showed reverence for God, was listening. The Lord opened _her_ ^[Literally "whose"] heart to pay attention to what was being said by Paul.

###### v15
And after she was baptized, and her household, she urged _us_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] saying, "If you consider me to be a believer in the Lord, come to my house _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("come") has been translated as a finite verb] stay." And she prevailed upon us.

###### v16
And it happened that _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were going")] we were going to the place of prayer, a certain female slave who had a spirit of divination ^[Literally "a spirit of Python"; Python was the name of the serpent or dragon that guarded the Delphic oracle at the foot of Mt. Parnassus and the word eventually came to be used for a spirit of divination] met us, who was bringing a large profit to her owners _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the infinitive ("fortune-telling") which is understood as means] fortune-telling.

###### v17
She followed Paul and us _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("followed") has been translated as a finite verb] was crying out, saying, "These men are slaves of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation!"

###### v18
And she was doing this for many days. But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed and turning around, said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" And it came out _immediately_. ^[Literally "_that_ same hour"]

###### v19
But _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("seized") has been translated as a finite verb] dragged _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] into the marketplace before the rulers.

###### v20
And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had brought") which is understood as temporal] had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, "These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews,

###### v21
and are proclaiming customs that are not permitted for us to accept or to practice, _because we_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as causal] are Romans!"

###### v22
And the crowd joined in attacking them, and the chief magistrates tore off their clothing _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("tore off") has been translated as a finite verb] gave orders to beat _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] with rods.

###### v23
And _after they_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had inflicted") which is understood as temporal] had inflicted many blows on them, they threw _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] into prison, giving orders to the jailer to guard them securely.

###### v24
Having received such an order, _he_ ^[Literally "who"] put them in the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. ^[Or possibly "to the _block_ of wood," referring to a log to which the prisoners were chained or tied]

###### v25
Now about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("were praying") has been translated as a finite verb] singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.

###### v26
And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and all the bonds ^[Or "chains"] were unfastened.

###### v27
And _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as temporal] the jailer was awake and saw the doors of the prison open, he drew _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] sword _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("drew") has been translated as a finite verb] was about to kill himself, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("thought") which is understood as causal] thought the prisoners had escaped.

###### v28
But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, "Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here!"

###### v29

###### v33
And he took them at that _very_ hour of the night _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took") has been translated as a finite verb] washed _their_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] wounds, and he himself was baptized at once, and all those of his _household_. ^[*The word "_household_" is not in the Greek text, but is supplied from the previous verse]

###### v34
And he brought them up into _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] house _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("brought … up") has been translated as a finite verb] set a meal before _them_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and rejoiced greatly that he had believed in God with his whole household.

###### v35
And _when it_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was")] was day, the chief magistrates sent the police officers, saying, "Release those men."

###### v36
And the jailer reported these words to Paul: "The chief magistrates have sent _an order_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] that you should be released. So come out now _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("come out") has been translated as a finite verb] go in peace!"

###### v37
But Paul said to them, "They beat us in public without due process--men who are Roman citizens--_and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("beat") has been translated as a finite verb] threw _us_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] into prison, and now they are wanting to release us secretly? Certainly not! Rather let them come themselves _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("come") has been translated as a finite verb] bring us out!"

###### v38
So the police officers reported these words to the chief magistrates, and they were afraid _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard that they were Roman citizens.

###### v39
And they came _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came") has been translated as a finite verb] apologized to ^[Or "reassured"; or "conciliated"] them, and _after they_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("brought … out") which is understood as temporal] brought _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] out they asked _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to depart from the city.

###### v40
And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came out") which is understood as temporal] came out of the prison, they went to Lydia and _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw _them_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] they encouraged the brothers and departed.
