###### v1
Now _after they_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("traveled through") which is understood as temporal] traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

###### v2
_And as was his custom_, ^[Literally "and in accordance with what he was accustomed to"] Paul went in to them and on three Sabbath _days_ he discussed with them from the scriptures,

###### v3
explaining and demonstrating that it was necessary _for_ the Christ ^[Or "Messiah"] to suffer and to rise from the dead, and _saying_, "This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ." ^[Or "Messiah"]

###### v4
And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, and _also_ a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few of the prominent women.

###### v5
But the Jews were filled with jealousy and, taking along some worthless men from the rabble in the marketplace and forming a mob, threw the city into an uproar. And attacking Jason's house, they were looking for them to bring _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] out to the popular assembly.

###### v6
And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("find") which is understood as temporal] did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brothers before the city officials, shouting, "These _people_ who have stirred up trouble _throughout_ the world ^[Or "empire"] have come here also,

###### v7
whom Jason has entertained as guests! And these _people_ _are_ all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus!"

###### v8
And they threw the crowd into confusion, and the city officials who heard these _things_.

###### v9
And _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("taking") which is understood as temporal] taking money as security from Jason and the rest, they released them.

###### v10
Now the brothers sent away both Paul and Silas at once, during the night, to Berea. _They_ ^[Literally "who" (referring to Paul and Silas)] went into the synagogue of the Jews _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("arrived") which is understood as temporal] arrived.

###### v11
Now these were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica. _They_ ^[Literally "who"] accepted the message with all eagerness, examining the scriptures every day _to see_ if these _things_ were so.

###### v12
Therefore many of them believed, and not a few of the prominent Greek women and men.

###### v13
But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that the message of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there too, inciting and stirring up the crowds.

###### v14
So then the brothers sent Paul away at once to go to the sea, and both Silas and Timothy remained there.

###### v15
And those who conducted Paul brought _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] as far as Athens, and _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("receiving") which is understood as temporal] receiving an order for Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as soon as possible, they went away.

###### v16
Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("observed") which is understood as temporal] observed the city was full of idols.

###### v17
So he was discussing in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing _Gentiles_, ^[*Here the word "_Gentiles_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.

###### v18
And even some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him, and some were saying, "What does this babbler want to say?" But _others said_, ^[*The words "_others said_" are not in the Greek text but are implied] "He appears to be a proclaimer of foreign deities," because he was proclaiming the good news _about_ Jesus and the resurrection.

###### v19
And they took hold of him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took hold of") has been translated as a finite verb] brought _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to the Areopagus, saying, "May we learn what _is_ this new teaching being proclaimed by you?

###### v20
For you are bringing some astonishing things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what _these things mean_." ^[Literally "these _things_ want to be"]

###### v21
(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who stayed there used to spend _their_ time in nothing else than telling something or listening to something new.)

###### v22
So Paul stood there in the middle of the Areopagus _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("stood there") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Men of Athens, I see you _are_ very religious _in every respect_. ^[Literally "with respect to all _things_"]

###### v23
For _as I_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was passing through") which is understood as temporal] was passing through and observing carefully your objects of worship, I even found an altar on which was inscribed, 'To an unknown God.' Therefore what you worship without knowing _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] this I proclaim to you--

###### v24
the God who made the world and all the things in it. This one, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by human hands,

###### v25
nor is he served by human hands _as if he_ ^[Here "_as_ if" is supplied as a component of the conditional adverbial participle ("needed")] needed anything, _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("gives") which is understood as causal] he himself gives to everyone life and breath and everything.

###### v26
And he made from one _man_ every nation of humanity to live on all the face of the earth, determining _their_ fixed times and the fixed boundaries of their habitation,

###### v27
to search for God, if perhaps indeed they might feel around for him and find _him_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] And indeed he is not far away from each one of us,

###### v28
for in him we live and move and exist, ^[Some interpreters hold that the phrase "in him we live and move and exist" is a quotation from Epimenides of Crete, but more likely it is a traditional Greek formula] as even some of _your own_ ^[Literally "with respect to you"] poets have said: 'For we also are _his_ ^[Literally "of _him_"] offspring.' ^[A quotation from Aratus, _Phaenomena_ 5]

###### v29
Therefore, _because we_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as causal] are offspring of God, we ought not to think the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by human skill and thought.

###### v30
Therefore _although_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("has overlooked") which is understood as concessive] God has overlooked the times of ignorance, he now commands all people everywhere to repent,

###### v31
because he has set a day on which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man who he has appointed, having provided proof to everyone _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("raising") which is understood as means] raising him from the dead."

###### v32
Now _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard about") which is understood as temporal] heard about the resurrection of the dead, _some_ scoffed, but _others_ said, "We will hear you about this again also."

###### v33
So Paul went out from the midst of them.

###### v34
But some people ^[Here the Greek term "men" is used as a generic for "people"; note the presence of of a woman (Damaris) in the group] joined him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("joined") has been translated as a finite verb] believed, among whom also _were_ Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman _named_ ^[Literally "by name"] Damaris and others with them.
