###### v1
And looking intently at the Sanhedrin, Paul said, "Men _and_ brothers, I have lived my life in all good conscience before God to this day."

###### v2
So the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near him to strike his mouth.

###### v3
Then Paul said to him, "God is going to strike you, _you_ whitewashed wall! And are you sitting _there_ judging me according to the law, and acting contrary to the law do you order me to be struck?"

###### v4
And those who stood nearby said, "Are you reviling the high priest of God?"

###### v5
And Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, 'You must not speak evil _of_ a ruler of your people.'" ^[A quotation from [[Exod-22#v28|Exod 22:28]]]

###### v6
Now _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("realized") which is understood as temporal] Paul realized that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he shouted out in the Sanhedrin, "Men _and_ brothers! I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees! I am being judged concerning the hope and the resurrection of the dead!"

###### v7
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("said")] he said this, a dispute developed between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.

###### v8
(For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection or angel or spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge _them_ all.)

###### v9
And there was loud shouting, and some of the scribes from the party of the Pharisees stood up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("stood up") has been translated as a finite verb] contended sharply, saying, "We find nothing wrong with this man! But _what_ if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"

###### v10
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("became")] the dispute became severe, the military tribune, fearing lest Paul be torn apart by them, ordered the detachment to go down, take him away from their midst, and bring _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] into the barracks. ^[Or "headquarters"]

###### v11
And the next night the Lord stood by him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("stood by") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Have courage, for as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome."

###### v12
And _when it_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was")] was day, the Jews made a conspiracy _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("made") has been translated as a finite verb] bound themselves under a curse, saying _they would_ ^[Literally "saying neither to eat nor to drink"; the words "they would" are supplied for smoother English style] neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.

###### v13
Now there were more _than_ forty who had made this conspiracy,

###### v14
who went to the chief priests and the elders _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went to") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "We have bound ourselves under a curse to partake of nothing until we have killed Paul.

###### v15
Therefore, now you along with the Sanhedrin explain to the military tribune that he should bring him down to you, as _if you_ were going to determine more accurately the things concerning him. And we are ready to do away with him before he comes near."

###### v16
But _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard about") which is understood as temporal] the son of Paul's sister heard about the ambush, he came and entered into the barracks ^[Or "headquarters"] _and_ ^[Here "and" is supplied because the two previous participles ("came" and "entered") have been translated as finite verbs] reported _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to Paul.

###### v17
So Paul called one of the centurions _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("called") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Bring this young man to the military tribune, because he has something to report to him."

###### v18
So he took him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took") has been translated as a finite verb] brought _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to the military tribune and said, "The prisoner Paul called me _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("called") has been translated as a finite verb] asked _me_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to bring this young man to you _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("has") which is understood as causal] has something to tell you."

###### v19
And the military tribune, taking hold of his hand and withdrawing privately, asked, "What is it that you have to report to me?"

###### v20
And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you that you bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow, as _if they_ were going to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.

###### v21
You therefore do not be persuaded by them, because more _than_ forty men of _their number_ ^[Literally "them"] are lying in wait _for_ him, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have done away with him. And now they are ready, waiting for _you to agree_." ^[Literally "the assurance of agreement from you"]

###### v22
So the military tribune sent the young man away, directing _him_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] "Tell no one that you have revealed these _things_ to me."

###### v23
And he summoned two of the centurions _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("summoned") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Make ready from the third hour of the night two hundred soldiers and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, ^[A word of uncertain meaning, probably a military technical term] in order that they may proceed as far as Caesarea.

###### v24
And provide mounts so that they can put Paul on them _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("put … on") has been translated as a finite verb] bring _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] safely to Felix the governor."

###### v25
_He wrote_ ^[Literally "writing"] a letter that had this form: ^[Or "content"]

###### v26
Claudius Lysias.
To his excellency Governor Felix.
Greetings!

###### v27
This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them _when I_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came upon") which is understood as temporal] came upon _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] with the detachment _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came upon") has been translated as a finite verb] rescued _him_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] _because I_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("learned") which is understood as causal] learned that he was a Roman citizen.

###### v28
And _because I_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("wanted") which is understood as causal] wanted to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] down to their Sanhedrin. ^[Or "council"]

###### v29
I found _he_ ^[Literally "whom"] was accused concerning controversial questions of their law, but having no charge deserving death or imprisonment.

###### v30
And _when it_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was made known") which is understood as temporal] was made known to me there would be a plot against the man, I sent _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to you immediately, also ordering _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] accusers to speak against him ^[Some manuscripts have "to state the charges against him" (literally, "to speak the _things_ against him")] before you.

###### v31
Therefore the soldiers, in accordance with _their orders_, ^[Literally "what was ordered to them"] took Paul _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took") has been translated as a finite verb] brought _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to Antipatris during the night.

###### v32
And on the next day they let the horsemen go on with him, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("let") has been translated as a finite verb] they returned to the barracks. ^[Or "headquarters"]

###### v33
_The horsemen_, ^[Literally "who"] _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came") which is understood as temporal] came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, also presented Paul to him.

###### v34
So _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("reading") which is understood as temporal] reading _the letter_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and asking what province he was from, and learning that _he was_ from Cilicia,
