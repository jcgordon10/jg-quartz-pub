So Agrippa said to Paul, "It is permitted for you to speak for yourself." Then Paul extended _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hand _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("extended") has been translated as a finite verb] began to defend himself: ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to defend himself")]

###### v2
"Concerning all _the things_ of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate _that_ before you I am about to defend myself today,

###### v3
_because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as causal] you are especially acquainted with both all the customs and controversial questions with respect to the Jews.

"Now all the Jews know my manner of life from _my_ youth, that had taken place from the beginning among my _own_ people ^[Or "nation"] and in Jerusalem,

And now I stand here on trial on the basis of hope in the promise made by God to our fathers,

to which our twelve tribes hope to attain as _they_ earnestly serve _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] night and day. Concerning this hope I am being accused by the Jews, O king!

Why is it thought incredible by you _people_ ^[Here "people" is supplied in the translation to indicate that the pronoun ("you") is plural] that God raises the dead?

Indeed, I myself thought it was necessary to do many _things_ opposed to the name of Jesus the Nazarene,

###### v10
which I also did in Jerusalem, and not only did I lock up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the chief priests, but also _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were being executed")] they were being executed, I cast _my_ vote ^[Literally "voting pebble," but here "vote" rather than "voting pebble" is used in the translation to avoid the idea that this small stone was actually thrown at the accused (it was used as a method of voting)] against _them_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v11
And throughout all the synagogues I punished them often _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("punished") has been translated as a finite verb] tried to force ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as conative here ("tried to force")] _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to blaspheme, and _because I_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was enraged") which is understood as causal] was enraged at them beyond measure, I was pursuing _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] even as far as to foreign cities.

###### v12
In _this activity_ ^[Literally "which"] I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and full power of the chief priests.

###### v13
In the middle of the day along the road, O king, I saw a light from heaven, more than the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who were traveling with me.

And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("had … fallen")] we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Aramaic language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? _It is_ hard for you to kick against the goads!'

So I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.

###### v16
But get up and stand on your feet, because for this _reason_ I have appeared to you, to appoint you a servant and witness both _to the things_ in which you saw me and _to the things_ in which I will appear to you,

###### v17
rescuing you from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you,

###### v18
to open their eyes _so that they_ may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, _so that_ they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'

###### v19
"Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,

###### v20
but to those in Damascus first, and in Jerusalem and all the region of Judea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed _that they should_ repent and turn to God, doing deeds worthy of repentance.

###### v21
On account of these _things_ the Jews seized me in ^[Some manuscripts have "while I was in"] the temple _courts_ ^[Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("seized") has been translated as a finite verb] were attempting to kill _me_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v24
And _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was saying … in his defense")] he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "You are out of your mind, Paul! _Your_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] great learning _is driving_ ^[Literally "is turning"] you _insane_!" ^[Literally "to madness"]

###### v25
But Paul said, "I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but am speaking words of truth and rationality.

###### v26
For the king knows about these _things_, to whom also I am speaking freely, for I am not convinced _that_ these _things_ in any way have escaped ^[Some manuscripts have "that any of these _things_ in any way has escaped"] his notice, because this _was_ ^[Literally "is"] not _done_ ^[Literally "having been done"] in a corner.

###### v27
Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe."

###### v29
And Paul _replied_, "I pray to God, whether in a short time or in a long time, not only you but also all those who are listening to me today may become such _people_ as I also am, except for these bonds!"
