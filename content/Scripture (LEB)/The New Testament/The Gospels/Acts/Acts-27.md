###### v1
And when it was decided _that_ we would sail away to Italy, they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion _named_ ^[Literally "by name"] Julius of the Augustan ^[The meaning and significance of the title "Augustan" is highly debated, as is the precise identification of this military unit; it may be an honorary unit designation given to auxiliary or provincial troops] Cohort.

###### v2
And we went aboard a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to the places along the _coast_ ^[The word "_coast_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] of Asia ^[A reference to the Roman province of Asia (modern Asia Minor)] _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went aboard") has been translated as a finite verb] put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.

###### v3
And on the next _day_, we put in at Sidon. And Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to go to _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] friends _to be cared for_. ^[Literally "to experience care"]

###### v4
And from there we put out to sea _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("put out to sea") has been translated as a finite verb] sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against _us_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v5
And _after we_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had sailed across") which is understood as temporal] had sailed across the open sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we put in at Myra in Lycia.

###### v6
And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("found") has been translated as a finite verb] put us _on board_ ^[Literally "into"] it.

###### v7
And sailing slowly, in many days and with difficulty we came ^[Here this participle ("came") has been translated as a finite verb in keeping with English style] to Cnidus. _Because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the causal genitive absolute participle ("permit … to go further")] the wind did not permit us to go further, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.

###### v8
And sailing along its coast with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near which was the town _of_ Lasea.

###### v9
And _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the causal genitive absolute participle ("had passed")] considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast ^[A reference to the Jewish Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) which occurs in mid-autumn] was already over, Paul strongly recommended,

###### v10
saying to them, "Men, I perceive that the voyage is going _to end_ ^[Literally "to be"] with disaster and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives!"

###### v11
But the centurion was convinced even more by the shipmaster and the shipowner than by what was said by Paul.

###### v12
And _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the causal genitive absolute participle ("was")] the harbor was unsuitable for spending the winter in, the majority decided on a plan to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could arrive at Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing toward the southwest and toward the northwest, to spend the winter _there_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v13
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("began to blow gently")] a southwest wind began to blow gently, _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("thought") which is understood as causal] thought _they_ could accomplish their purpose, they weighed anchor _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("weighed anchor") has been translated as a finite verb] sailed close along Crete.

###### v14
But not long afterward a wind like a hurricane, called the northeaster, ^[Literally "Euraquilo," a violent northern wind] rushed down from it. ^[That is, from the island of Crete]

###### v15
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was caught")] the ship was caught and _was_ not able to head into the wind, we gave way _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("gave way") has been translated as a finite verb] were driven _along_.

###### v16
And running under the lee of a certain small island called Cauda, we were able with difficulty to get the ship's boat under control.

###### v17
_After_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("hoisting") which is understood as temporal] hoisting _it up_, ^[Literally "which"] they made use of supports to undergird the ship. And _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were afraid") which is understood as causal] were afraid lest they run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("lowered") has been translated as a finite verb] thus were driven _along_.

###### v18
And _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the causal genitive absolute participle ("battered by the storm")] we were violently battered by the storm, on the next _day_ _they began_ ^[Literally "they began to carry out"] jettisoning _the cargo_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v19
and on the third _day_ they threw overboard the gear of the ship with their own hands.

###### v20
But _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("appeared")] neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and _with_ not a little bad weather confronting _us_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] finally all hope was abandoned _that_ we would be saved.

###### v21
And _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the causal genitive absolute participle ("were experiencing")] many were experiencing lack of appetite, at that time Paul stood up in their midst _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("stood up") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Men, _you_ ought to have followed my _advice_ not to put out to sea from Crete, and _thus_ avoided this damage and loss!

###### v22
And now I urge you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life from among you, but only of the ship.

###### v23
For this night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve came to me,

###### v24
saying, 'Do not be afraid, Paul! It is necessary _for_ you to stand before Caesar, and behold, God has graciously granted you all who are sailing with you.'

###### v25
Therefore keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will be like this--according to _the_ ^[Literally "which"] way it was told to me.

###### v26
But it is necessary _that_ we run aground on some island."

###### v27
And when the fourteenth night had come, _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were being driven")] we were being driven in the Adriatic Sea about the middle of the night, the sailors suspected _they were approaching some land_. ^[Literally "some land was approaching them"]

###### v28
And taking soundings, they found twenty fathoms. So going on a little _further_ and taking soundings again, they found fifteen fathoms.

###### v29
And _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were afraid") which is understood as causal] were afraid lest somewhere we run aground against rough places, they threw down four anchors from the stern _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("threw down") has been translated as a finite verb] prayed for day to come.

###### v30
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were seeking")] the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship and were lowering the ship's boat into the sea, pretending as if they were going to lay out anchors from the bow,

###### v31
Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these _men_ remain with the ship, you cannot be saved!"

###### v32
Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship's boat and let it fall away. ^[Or "let it drift away"]

###### v33
And until the day was about to come, Paul was urging _them_ all to take _some_ food, saying, "Today _is the_ fourteenth day you have waited _anxiously_, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("have waited") has been translated as a finite verb] you have continued without eating, having taken nothing.

###### v34
Therefore I urge you to take _some_ food, for this is necessary for your preservation. For not a hair from your head will be lost."

###### v35
And _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("said") which is understood as temporal] said these _things_ and took bread, he gave thanks to God in front of _them_ all, and _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("breaking") which is understood as temporal] breaking _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] he began to eat.

###### v36
So they all were ^[Here this participle ("were") has been translated as a finite verb in keeping with English style] encouraged and partook of food themselves.

###### v37
(Now we were _in_ all two hundred seventy six persons on the ship.)

###### v38
And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had eaten their fill") which is understood as temporal] had eaten their fill of food, they lightened the ship _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("throwing") which is understood as means] throwing the wheat ^[Or "grain"] into the sea.

###### v39
Now when day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay having a beach, onto which they decided to run the ship ashore if they could.

###### v40
And slipping the anchors, they left _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes ^[Or "bands" (referring to the linkage that tied the steering oars together)] of the steering oars. And hoisting the foresail to the _wind_ that was blowing, they held course for the beach.

###### v41
But falling into a place of crosscurrents, ^[Or "a reef"; literally "a place of two seas," an expression of uncertain meaning but most likely a nautical technical term for some adverse sea condition] they ran the ship aground. And the bow stuck fast _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("stuck fast") has been translated as a finite verb] stayed immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the violence. ^[Some manuscripts have "the violence of the waves"]

###### v42
Now the plan of the soldiers was that they would kill the prisoners lest any escape _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("swimming away") which is understood as means] swimming away,

###### v43
but the centurion, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("wanted") which is understood as causal] wanted to save Paul, prevented them _from doing what they intended_, ^[Literally "of the intention"] and gave orders _that_ those who were able to swim should jump in first to get to the land,

###### v44
and _then_ the rest, _some_ of whom _floated_ ^[The word "_floated_" is not in the Greek text, but is supplied in the translation for clarity] on planks and _some_ of whom on anything _that was_ from the ship. And in this way all were brought safely to the land.
