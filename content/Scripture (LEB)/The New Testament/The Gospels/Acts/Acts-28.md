And _after we_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were brought safely through") which is understood as temporal] were brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta.

###### v2
And the local inhabitants showed _extraordinary_ ^[Literally "not the ordinary"] kindness to us, for they lit a fire _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("lit") has been translated as a finite verb] welcomed us all, because of the rain that had begun and because of the cold.

###### v3
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("had gathered")] Paul had gathered a large number of sticks and was placing _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came out") has been translated as a finite verb] fastened itself on his hand.

###### v4
And when the local people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began saying")] to one another, "Doubtless this man is a murderer whom, _although he_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was rescued") which is understood as concessive] was rescued from the sea, Justice ^[Here personified as a goddess] has not permitted to live!"

###### v6
But they were expecting _that_ he was going to swell up ^[Or "to burn with fever" (either meaning is possible here)] or suddenly to fall down dead.

###### v8
And it happened that the father of Publius was lying down, afflicted with fever and dysentery.

###### v9
And _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("had taken place")] this had taken place, the rest of those on the island who had diseases were coming and being healed also.

###### v10

###### v12
And putting in at Syracuse, we stayed _there_ three days.

###### v13
From there we got underway ^[Or "we sailed along" (with "the coast" understood); the exact meaning of the text as it stands is disputed and various additional terms have to be supplied in any case] _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("got underway") has been translated as a finite verb] arrived at Rhegium, and after one day a south wind came up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] on the second day we came to Puteoli,

###### v14
where we found brothers, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("found") has been translated as a finite verb] were implored to stay with them seven days. And in this way we came to Rome.

###### v15
And from there the brothers, _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard the _news_ about us, came to meet us as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns. _When he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw them, Paul gave thanks to God _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("gave thanks") has been translated as a finite verb] took courage.

###### v16
And when we entered into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who was guarding him.

who, _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had examined") which is understood as temporal] had examined me, were wanting to release _me_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] because there was no basis for an accusation _worthy_ of death with me.

###### v19
But _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the causal genitive absolute participle ("objected")] the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar (not as _if I_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had") which is understood as concessive] had any _charge_ to bring against my _own_ people). ^[Or "nation"]

###### v20
Therefore for this reason I have requested to see you and to speak with _you_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] for because of the hope of Israel I am wearing this chain!"

###### v21
And they said to him, "We have received no letters about you from Judea, nor has any of the brothers come _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("come") has been translated as a finite verb] reported or spoken anything evil about you.

###### v22

###### v23
And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had set") which is understood as temporal] had set a day with him, many more came to him at his lodging place, to whom he was explaining from early in the morning until evening, testifying about the kingdom of God and attempting to convince ^[Here the present tense has been translated as conative ("attempting to convince")] them about Jesus from both the law of Moses and the prophets.

###### v24

saying,
'Go to this people and say,
"_You will keep on hearing_ ^[Literally "hearing you will hear"] and will never understand,
and _you will keep on seeing_ ^[Literally "seeing you will see"] and will never perceive.

###### v27
    For the heart of this people has become dull,
and with _their_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] ears they hear with difficulty,
and they have shut their eyes,
lest they see with _their_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] eyes,
and hear with _their_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] ears,
and understand with _their_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] heart,
and turn, and I would heal them."' ^[A quotation from [[Isa-06#v9|Isa 6:9–10]][[Isa-06#v10|]]]

###### v28
