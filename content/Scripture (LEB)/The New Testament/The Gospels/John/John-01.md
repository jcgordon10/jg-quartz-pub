[[John-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

###### v2
This one was in the beginning with God.

###### v3
All _things_ came into being through him, and apart from him not one _thing_ came into being that ^[Or "came into being. What …," beginning a new sentence connected with the following verse. A major punctuation problem is involved, since the earliest manuscripts have no punctuation, but some important later ones place the punctuation before this phrase, effectively connecting it to v. [[John-01#v4|4]]: "What has come into being was life in him"] has come into being.

###### v4
In him was life, and the life was the light of humanity. ^[Or "humankind"]

###### v5
And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome ^[Or "comprehend" (if primarily referring to people in the world)] it.

###### v6
A man came, sent from God, _whose name was_ ^[Literally "the name to him"] John.

###### v7
This one came for a witness, in order that he could testify about the light, so that all would believe through him.

###### v8
That one was not the light, but _came_ ^[The verb is implied from the previous verse, and must be supplied in the English translation] in order that he could testify about the light.

###### v9
The true light, who gives light to every person, was coming into the world.

###### v10
He was in the world, and the world came into being through him, and the world did not recognize ^[Or "acknowledge"] him.

###### v11
He came to his own _things_, and his own _people_ did not receive him.

###### v12
But as many as received him--to those who believe in his name--he gave to them authority to become children of God,

###### v13
who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a husband, but of God.

###### v14
And the Word became flesh and took up residence among us, and we saw his glory, glory as of the one and only from the Father, full of grace and truth.

###### v15
John testified about him and cried out, saying, "This one was _he about_ whom I said, 'The one who comes after me is ahead of me, because he existed before me.'"

###### v16
For from his fullness we have all received, and grace after grace.

###### v17
For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ.

###### v18
No one has seen God at any time; the one and only, God, the one who is in the bosom of the Father--that one has made _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] known.

###### v19
And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent ^[Some manuscripts have "sent to him"] priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they could ask him, "Who are you?"

###### v20
And he confessed--and he did not deny, and confessed--"I am not the Christ!"

###### v21
And they asked him, "Then who _are_ you? Are you Elijah?" And he said, "I am not!" "Are you the Prophet?" ^[A reference to the "Prophet like Moses" of [[Deut-18#v15|Deut 18:15]] (see [[Acts-03#v22|Acts 3:22]])] And he answered, "No!"

###### v22
Then they said to him, "Who are you, so that we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?"

###### v23
He said,
"I _am_ 'the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,
"Make straight the way of the Lord,"' ^[A quotation from [[Isa-40#v3|Isa 40:3]]]
just as Isaiah the prophet said."

###### v24
(And they had been sent from the Pharisees.)

###### v25
And they asked him and said to him, "Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"

###### v26
John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water. In your midst stands _one_ whom you do not know--

###### v27
the one who comes after me, of whom I am not worthy _to untie_ ^[Literally "that I might untie"] the strap of his sandal!"

###### v28
These _things_ took place in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

###### v29
On the next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, "Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!

###### v30
This one is _the one_ about whom I said, 'After me is coming a man who is ahead of me, because he existed before me.'

###### v31
And I did not know him, but in order that he could be revealed to Israel, because of this I came baptizing with water."

###### v32
And John testified, saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and remaining upon him.

###### v33
And I did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water, that one said to me, '_The one_ upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him--this one is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'

###### v34
And I have seen and testify that this one is the Chosen One ^[Some manuscripts have "the Son of God"] of God.

###### v35
On the next day again John was standing _there_, ^[*The word "_there_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] and two of his disciples,

###### v36
and looking at Jesus _as he_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("walking by") which is understood as temporal] was walking by, he said, "Look! The Lamb of God!"

###### v37
And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.

###### v38
And Jesus, turning around and seeing them following _him_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] said to them, "What do you seek?" And they said to him, "Rabbi" (which means _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("translated") which is understood as temporal] translated "Teacher"), "where are you staying?"

###### v39
He said to them, "Come and you will see!" So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day (it was about the tenth hour).

###### v40
Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed him.

###### v41
This one first found his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah!" (which is translated "Christ").

###### v42
He brought him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, "You are Simon the son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which is interpreted "Peter").

###### v43
On the next day he wanted to depart for Galilee, and he found Philip. And Jesus said to him, "Follow me!"

###### v44
(Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.)

###### v45
Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found _the one_ whom Moses wrote _about_ in the law, and the prophets wrote _about_--Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth!"

###### v46
And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see!"

###### v47
Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him, "Look! _A true Israelite_ ^[Literally "truly an Israelite"] in whom is no deceit!"

###### v48
Nathanael said to him, "From where do you know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, _when you_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as temporal] were under the fig tree, I saw you."

###### v49
Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the king of Israel!"

###### v50
Jesus answered and said to him, "Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater _things_ than these!"

###### v51
And he said to him, "Truly, truly I say to all of you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."
