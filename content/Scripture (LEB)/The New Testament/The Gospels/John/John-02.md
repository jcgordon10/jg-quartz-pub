And on the third day, there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.

###### v2
And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding.

And _when the_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("ran out")] wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, "They have no wine!"

###### v4
And Jesus said to her, "What _does your concern have to do with me_, ^[Literally "to me and to you"] woman? My hour has not yet come."

###### v5
His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do _it_!" ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v6
Now six stone water jars were set there, in accordance with the ceremonial cleansing of the Jews, each holding two or three measures. ^[A "measure" was about 9 gallons (40 liters)]

###### v7
Jesus said to them, "Fill the water jars with water." And they filled them to the brim.

###### v8
And he said to them, "Now draw _some_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] out and take _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to the head steward. So they took _it_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v9
Now when the head steward tasted the water which had become wine and did not know where it was from--but the servants who had drawn the water knew--the head steward summoned the bridegroom

###### v10
and said to him, "_Everyone_ ^[Literally "every man"] serves the good wine first, and whenever they are drunk, the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!"

###### v11
This beginning of signs Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.

###### v12
After this he went down to Capernaum, and his mother and brothers ^[Some manuscripts have "his brothers"] and his disciples, and they stayed there _a few_ ^[Literally "not many"] days.

###### v13
And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

###### v14
And he found in the temple _courts_ ^[Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated.

###### v15
And he made a whip of cords _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("made") has been translated as a finite verb] drove _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] all out of the temple _courts_, ^[*Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] both the sheep and the oxen, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] tables.

###### v16
And to the ones selling the doves he said, "Take these _things_ away from here! Do not make my Father's house _a marketplace_!" ^[Literally "a market house"; or "a house of merchants" (an allusion to [[Zech-14#v21|Zech 14:21]])]

###### v17
His disciples remembered that it is written, "Zeal for your house will consume me." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-69#v9|Ps 69:9]]]

###### v18
So the Jews answered and said to him, "What sign do you show to us, because you are doing these _things_?"

###### v19
Jesus answered and said to them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up!"

###### v20
Then the Jews said, "This temple has been under construction ^[This translation of the aorist verb is based on a very close parallel in [[Ezr-05#v16|Ezra 5:16]] (LXX), where it is clear from the following verb that the construction had not yet been completed] forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?"

###### v21
But he was speaking about the temple of his body.

###### v22
So when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the saying that Jesus had spoken.

###### v23
Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as causal] saw his signs which he was doing.

###### v24
But Jesus himself did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all _people_, ^[The Greek term is masculine and thus refers to "all _people_" rather than "all _things_" (which would be neuter)]

###### v25
and because he did not _need_ ^[Literally "have need that"] anyone _to testify_ ^[Literally "should testify"] about man, for he himself knew what was in man. ^[*Here "man" has been retained rather than the generic "people" to maintain the connection with the following verse]
