###### v1
Now there was a man of the Pharisees _whose name was_ ^[Literally "the name to him"] Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.

###### v2
This man came to him at night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that _you are_ ^[Here both the pronoun and verb are understood in Greek and are supplied in the translation] a teacher who has come from God, for no one is able to perform these signs that you are performing unless God were with him."

###### v3
Jesus answered and said to him, "Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born from above, ^[The same Greek word can mean either "from above" or "again," which allows for the misunderstanding by Nicodemus here; Jesus was speaking of new birth "from above," while Nicodemus misunderstood him to mean a second physical birth] he is not able to see the kingdom of God."

###### v4
Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born _when he_ is an old man? He is not able to enter into his mother's womb for the second time and be born, _can he_?" ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_can he_"]

###### v5
Jesus answered, "Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born of water and spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.

###### v6
What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.

###### v7
Do not be astonished that I said to you, 'It is necessary for you to be born from above.' ^[The same Greek word can mean either "from above" or "again" (see also v. [[John-03#v3|3]])]

###### v8
The wind blows wherever it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."

###### v9
Nicodemus answered and said to him, "How can these _things_ be?"

###### v10
Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and you do not understand these _things_?

###### v11
Truly, truly I say to you, we speak what we know, and we testify _about_ what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony!

###### v12
If I tell you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

###### v13
And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven--the Son of Man.

###### v14
And just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, ^[An allusion to [[Num-21#v5|Num 21:5–9]][[Num-21#v6|]][[Num-21#v7|]][[Num-21#v8|]][[Num-21#v9|]]] thus it is necessary _that_ the Son of Man be lifted up,

###### v15
so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life." ^[Some interpreters and Bible translations extend the quotation of Jesus' words through v. [[John-03#v21|21]]]

###### v16
For in this way God loved the world, so that he gave his one and only Son, in order that everyone who believes in him will not perish, but will have eternal life.

###### v17
For God did not send his Son into the world in order that he should judge ^[Or "he should condemn"] the world, but in order that the world should be saved through him.

###### v18
The one who believes in him is not judged, ^[Or "condemned"] but the one who does not believe has already been judged, ^[Or "been condemned"] because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.

###### v19
And this is the judgment: that the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil.

###### v20
For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds be exposed.

###### v21
But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, in order that his deeds may be revealed, that they are done in God.

###### v22
After these _things_ Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory, and there he spent time with them and was baptizing.

###### v23
Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and they were coming and were being baptized.

###### v24
(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)

###### v25
So a dispute occurred on the part of John's disciples with a Jew ^[Some significant early manuscripts read "the Jews"] concerning purification.

###### v26
And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, about whom you testified--look, this one is baptizing, and all are coming to him!"

###### v27
John answered and said, "A man can receive not one _thing_ unless it is granted to him from heaven!

###### v28
You yourselves testify about me that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I am sent before that one.'

###### v29
The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices _greatly_ ^[Literally "with joy"] because of the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine is complete.

###### v30
It is necessary for that one to increase, but _for_ me to decrease."

###### v31
The one who comes from above is over all. The one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth; the one who comes from heaven is over all.

###### v32
What he has seen and heard, this he testifies, and no one accepts his testimony.

###### v33
The one who accepts his testimony has attested that God is true.

###### v34
For _the one_ whom God sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit by measure.

###### v35
The Father loves the Son and has given all _things_ into his hand.

###### v36
The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life--but the wrath of God remains on him. ^[Some interpreters and Bible translations extend the quotation of John the Baptist's words through v. [[John-03#v36|36]]]
