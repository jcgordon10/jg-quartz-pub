###### v1
Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John

###### v2
(although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples),

###### v3
he left Judea and departed again for Galilee.

###### v4
And it was necessary _for_ him to go through Samaria.

###### v5
Now he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.

###### v6
And Jacob's well was there, so Jesus, _because he_ had become tired from the journey, simply sat down at the well. It was about the sixth hour.

###### v7
A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give me _water_ ^[Here "water" is supplied in the translation as the understood direct object of the verb "give"] to drink."

###### v8
(For his disciples had gone away into the town so that they could buy food.)

###### v9
So the Samaritan woman said to him, "How do you, being a Jew, ask from me _water_ ^[Here "water" is supplied in the translation as the understood direct object of the verb "ask"] to drink, _since I_ ^[Here "_since_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("am") which is understood as causal] am a Samaritan woman?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)

###### v10
Jesus answered and said to her, "If you had known the gift of God and who it is who says to you, 'Give me _water_ ^[Here "water" is supplied in the translation as the understood direct object of the verb "give"] to drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."

###### v11
The woman said to him, "Sir, you have no bucket and the well is deep! From where then do you get this living water?

###### v12
You are not greater than our father Jacob, _are you_, ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated by the supplied phrase "_are you_" in the translation] who gave us the well and drank from it himself, and his sons and his livestock?"

###### v13
Jesus answered and said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again.

###### v14
But whoever drinks of this water which I will give to him will never be thirsty for eternity, but the water which I will give to him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life."

###### v15
The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or come here to draw _water_!" ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v16
He said to her, "Go, call your husband and come here."

###### v17
The woman answered and said to him, "I do not have a husband." Jesus said to her, "You have said rightly, 'I do not have a husband,'

###### v18
for you have had five husbands, and _the one_ whom you have now is not your husband; this you have said truthfully!"

###### v19
The woman said to him, "Sir, I see that you are a prophet.

###### v20
Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you _people_ ^[Here "_people_" is supplied in the translation because the Greek pronoun is plural] say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship."

###### v21
Jesus said to her, "Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.

###### v22
You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.

###### v23
But an hour is coming--and now is _here_ ^[The word "_here_" is not in the Greek text but is implied]--when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for indeed the Father seeks such _people_ _to be_ his worshipers.

###### v24
God _is_ spirit, and the ones who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."

###### v25
The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah is coming" (the one called Christ); "whenever that one comes, he will proclaim all _things_ to us."

###### v26
Jesus said to her, "I, the one speaking to you, am _he_. ^[*Here the predicate nominative is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v27
And at this _point_ ^[The word "_point_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] his disciples came, and they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman. However, no one said, "What do you seek?" or "Why are you speaking with her?"

###### v28
So the woman left her water jar and went away into the town and said to the people, ^[Assuming the term is used here in a generic sense to refer to persons of either gender, it should be translated "people"; if instead the term here refers only to the town leaders or elders who met at the town gate, then "men" would be appropriate]

###### v29
"Come, see a man who told me everything I have ever done! Perhaps this one is the Christ?"

###### v30
They went out from the town and were coming to him.

###### v31
In the meanwhile the disciples were asking him, saying, "Rabbi, eat _something_!" ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v32
But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know about."

###### v33
So the disciples began to say ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] to one another, "No one brought him _anything_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to eat, _did they_?" ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated by the supplied phrase "_did they_" in the translation]

###### v34
Jesus said to them, "My food is that I do the will of the one who sent me and complete his work.

###### v35
Do you not say, 'There are yet four months and the harvest comes'? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already. ^[Some interpreters and Bible translations place the word "already" at the beginning of the next verse: "Already the one who reaps receives wages …"]

###### v36
The one who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, in order that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together.

###### v37
For in this _instance_ ^[The word "_point_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] the saying is true, 'It is one who sows and another who reaps.'

###### v38
I sent you to reap what you did not work for; others have worked, and you have entered into their work."

###### v39
Now from that town many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman who testified, "He told me everything that I have done."

###### v40
So when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began asking")] him to stay with them. And he stayed there two days.

###### v41
And many more believed because of his word,

###### v42
And they were saying to the woman, "No longer because of _what you said_ ^[Literally "your speaking"] do we believe, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this one is truly the Savior of the world!"

###### v43
And after the two days he departed from there into Galilee.

###### v44
For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland.

###### v45
So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had seen") which is understood as causal] had seen all _the things_ he had done in Jerusalem at the feast (for they themselves had also come to the feast).

###### v46
Now he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And _there_ was at Capernaum a certain royal official whose son was sick.

###### v47
This man, _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, went to him and asked that he come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.

###### v48
So Jesus said to him, "Unless you _people_ ^[Here "_people_" is supplied in the translation because the Greek verb ("see") is plural] see signs and wonders, you will never believe!"

###### v49
The royal official said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies!"

###### v50
Jesus said to him, "Go, your son will live." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he departed.

###### v51
Now _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was going down")] he was going down, his slaves met him, saying that his child was alive.

###### v52
So he inquired from them the hour at which he had gotten better. Then they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."

###### v53
So the father knew that _it was_ that ^[Some manuscripts have "that _it was_ at that same hour"] same hour at which Jesus said to him, "Your son will live," and he himself believed, and his whole household.

###### v54
Now this _is_ again a second sign Jesus performed _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came") which is understood as temporal] came from Judea into Galilee.
