###### v1
After these _things_ _there_ was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

###### v2
Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool called in Aramaic _Bethzatha_, ^[The majority of later manuscripts read "Bethesda," while other early manuscripts read "Bethsaida"] which has five porticoes.

###### v3
In these were lying a large number of those who were sick, blind, lame, paralyzed.^[The majority of later manuscripts add the following words: "waiting for the moving of the water. 4 For an angel of the Lord from time to time went down in the pool and stirred up the water. So the one who went in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he suffered."]

###### v4
![[John-05#v3]]

###### v5
And a certain man was there who had _been_ thirty-eight years in his sickness.

###### v6
Jesus, _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw this one lying _there_ and knew that he had _been sick_ ^[The phrase "_been sick_" is not in the Greek text, but is supplied from the context] a long time already, said to him, "Do you want to become well?"

###### v7
The one who was sick answered him, "Sir, I do not have anyone that, whenever the water is stirred up, could put me into the pool. But _while_ ^[Literally "during which _time_"] I am coming, another goes down before me."

###### v8
Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk!"

###### v9
And immediately the man became well and picked up his mat and began to walk. ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to walk")] (Now it was the Sabbath on that day.)

###### v10
So the Jews were saying to the one who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath, and it is not permitted for you to pick up the mat!" ^[Some manuscripts have "your mat"]

###### v11
But he answered them, "The one who made me well--that one said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk!'"

###### v12
So they asked him, ^[Some manuscripts have "They asked him"] "Who is the man who said to you, 'Pick up _your mat_ ^[In Greek the direct object ("_your mat_") is not in the Greek text but the repetition is implied from the previous verse] and walk?'"

###### v13
But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was")] a crowd was in the place.

###### v14
After these _things_ Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "Look, you have become well! Sin no longer, lest something worse happen to you."

###### v15
The man went and reported to the Jews that Jesus was the one who made him well.

###### v16
And on account of this the Jews began to persecute ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to persecute")] Jesus, because he was doing these _things_ on the Sabbath.

###### v17
But he answered ^[Some manuscripts have "Jesus answered"] them, "My Father is working until now, and I am working."

###### v18
So on account of this the Jews were seeking even more to kill him, because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God his own Father, _thus_ ^[Here "_thus_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("making") which is understood as result] making himself equal with God.

###### v19
So Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly, truly I say to you, the Son can do nothing from himself except what he sees the Father doing. For whatever that one does, these _things_ also the Son does likewise.

###### v20
For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing. And greater works than these he will show him, so that you will be astonished.

###### v21
For just as the Father raises the dead and makes _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] alive, thus also the Son makes alive whomever he wishes.

###### v22
For the Father does not judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son,

###### v23
in order that all _people_ ^[The word "_people_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] will honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.

###### v24
Truly, truly I say to you that the one who hears my word and who believes the one who sent me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.

###### v25
"Truly, truly I say to you, that an hour is coming--and now is _here_--when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones who hear will live.

###### v26
For just as the Father has life in himself, thus also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself.

###### v27
And he has granted him authority to carry out judgment, because he is the Son of Man.

###### v28
"Do not be astonished _at_ this, because an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear his voice

###### v29
and they will come out--those who have done good _things_ to a resurrection of life, but those who have practiced evil _things_ to a resurrection of judgment.

###### v30
I am able to do nothing from myself. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my _own_ will, but the will of the one who sent me.

###### v31
"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.

###### v32
There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.

###### v33
You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.

###### v34
(And I do not receive testimony from people, but I say these _things_ in order that you may be saved.)

###### v35
That one was the lamp _which was_ burning and shining, and you wanted to rejoice for an hour in his light.

###### v36
"But I have a testimony greater than John's, for the works which the Father has given to me that I should complete them--the very works which I am doing--_these_ testify about me, that the Father has sent me.

###### v37
And the Father who sent me, that one has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form.

###### v38
And you do not have his word residing in yourselves, because the one whom that one sent, in this one you do not believe.

###### v39
You search ^[Or "Search" (an imperative)] the scriptures because you think that you have eternal life in them, and it is these that testify about me.

###### v40
And you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.

###### v41
"I do not accept glory ^[Or "honor"] from people,

###### v42
but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.

###### v43
I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me. If another should come in his own name, you would accept that one!

###### v44
How are you able to believe, _if you_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("accept") which is understood as conditional] accept glory from one another, and do not seek the glory _which is_ from the only God?

###### v45
Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father! The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope!

###### v46
For if you had believed Moses, you would believe me, for that one wrote about me.

###### v47
But if you do not believe that one's writings, how will you believe my words?"
