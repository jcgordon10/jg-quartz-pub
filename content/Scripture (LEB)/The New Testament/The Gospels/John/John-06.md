###### v1
After these _things_ Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee (that is, Tiberias).

###### v2
And a large crowd was following him because they were observing the signs that he was doing on those who were sick.

###### v3
So Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down there with his disciples.

###### v4
(Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.)

###### v5
_Then Jesus, when he looked up_ ^[Literally "then Jesus lifting up the eyes"]  ^[*Here "_when_" in the translation is supplied as a component of the participle "lifting up" which is understood as temporal] and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, said to Philip, "Where can we buy bread so that these _people_ can eat?"

###### v6
(Now he said this to test him, because he knew what he was going to do.)

###### v7
Philip replied to him, "Two hundred denarii _worth of_ bread would not be enough for them, in order that each one could receive a little."

###### v8
One of his disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him,

###### v9
"Here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many _people_?"

###### v10
Jesus said, "Make the people recline." (Now _there_ was a lot of grass in the place.) So the men reclined, approximately five thousand _in_ number.

###### v11
Then Jesus took the bread, and _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had given thanks") which is understood as temporal] had given thanks, he distributed _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to those who were reclining--likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.

###### v12
And when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, "Gather the remaining fragments so that nothing is lost."

###### v13
So they gathered _them_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.

###### v14
Now _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] the people saw the sign that he performed, they began to say, ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] "This one is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world!"

###### v15
Then Jesus, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("knew") which is understood as causal] knew that they were about to come and seize him in order to make _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] king, withdrew again up the mountain _by_ himself alone.

###### v16
Now when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea.

###### v17
And getting into a boat, they began to go ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to go")] to the other side of the sea, to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.

###### v18
And the sea began to be stirred up ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to be stirred up")] _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was blowing") which is understood as causal] a strong wind was blowing.

###### v19
Then _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had rowed") which is understood as temporal] had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, ^[A "stade" or "stadium" (plur. "stadia") is about 607 ft (187 m), so this was around 3 miles (5 km)] they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were afraid.

###### v20
But he said to them, "_It_ is I! Do not be afraid!"

###### v21
So they were wanting to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land to which they were going.

###### v22
On the next day, the crowd that was on the other side of the sea saw that other boats were not there (except one), and that Jesus had not entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had departed alone.

###### v23
Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("had given thanks")] the Lord had given thanks.

###### v24
So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.

###### v25
And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("found") which is understood as temporal] found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"

###### v26
Jesus replied to them and said, "Truly, truly I say to you, you seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied!

###### v27
Do not work for the food that perishes, but the food that remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has set his seal on this one."

###### v28
So they said to him, "What shall we do that we can accomplish the works of God?"

###### v29
Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the work of God: that you believe in _the one_ whom that one sent."

###### v30
So they said to him, "Then what sign will you perform, so that we can see _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and believe you? What will you do?

###### v31
Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.' ^[A quotation from [[Ps-78#v24|Ps 78:24]] which refers to the events of [[Exod-16#v4|Exod 16:4–36]][[Exod-16#v5|]][[Exod-16#v6|]][[Exod-16#v7|]][[Exod-16#v8|]][[Exod-16#v9|]][[Exod-16#v10|]][[Exod-16#v11|]][[Exod-16#v12|]][[Exod-16#v13|]][[Exod-16#v14|]][[Exod-16#v15|]][[Exod-16#v16|]][[Exod-16#v17|]][[Exod-16#v18|]][[Exod-16#v19|]][[Exod-16#v20|]][[Exod-16#v21|]][[Exod-16#v22|]][[Exod-16#v23|]][[Exod-16#v24|]][[Exod-16#v25|]][[Exod-16#v26|]][[Exod-16#v27|]][[Exod-16#v28|]][[Exod-16#v29|]][[Exod-16#v30|]][[Exod-16#v31|]][[Exod-16#v32|]][[Exod-16#v33|]][[Exod-16#v34|]][[Exod-16#v35|]][[Exod-16#v36|]]]

###### v32
Then Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly I say to you, Moses did not give you bread from heaven, but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven!

###### v33
For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."

###### v34
So they said to him, "Sir, always give us this bread!"

###### v35
Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never be hungry, and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty again.

###### v36
But I said to you that you have seen me and do not believe.

###### v37
Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never throw out,

###### v38
because I have come down from heaven not that I should do my will, but the will of the one who sent me.

###### v39
Now this is the will of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given me, I would not lose _any_ of them, ^[This pronoun is neuter singular in Greek, but is collective] but raise them ^[This pronoun is neuter singular in Greek, but is collective] up on the last day.

###### v40
For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks at the Son and believes in him would have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day."

###### v41
Now the Jews began to grumble ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to grumble")] about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven,"

###### v42
and they were saying, "Is this one not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, 'I have come down from heaven'?"

###### v43
Jesus answered and said to them, "Do not grumble _among yourselves_! ^[Literally "with one another"]

###### v44
No one is able to come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day.

###### v45
It is written in the prophets, 'And they will all be taught by God.' ^[A quotation from [[Isa-54#v13|Isa 54:13]]] Everyone who hears from the Father and learns comes to me.

###### v46
(Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God--this one has seen the Father.) ^[The switch from first person in vv. [[John-06#v44|44–45]][[John-06#v45|]] to third person here and back to first person in vv. [[John-06#v47|47–51]][[John-06#v48|]][[John-06#v49|]][[John-06#v50|]][[John-06#v51|]] suggests that this verse is a parenthetical comment by the author rather than the words of Jesus]

###### v47
Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life.

###### v48
I am the bread of life.

###### v49
Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died.

###### v50
This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that someone may eat from it and not die.

###### v51
I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread, he will live _forever_. ^[Literally "for the age"] And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."

###### v52
So the Jews began to quarrel ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to quarrel")] _among themselves_, ^[Literally "with one another"] saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"

###### v53
Then Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves!

###### v54
The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.

###### v55
For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.

###### v56
The one who eats ^[This term is somewhat graphic and typically used for animals feeding, but the distinction from other Greek verbs for eating is difficult to convey in English] my flesh and drinks my blood resides in me and I in him.

###### v57
Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, _so_ also the one who eats ^[This term is somewhat graphic and typically used for animals feeding, but the distinction from other Greek verbs for eating is difficult to convey in English] me--that one will live because of me.

###### v58
This is the bread that came down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. The one who eats ^[This term is somewhat graphic and typically used for animals feeding, but the distinction from other Greek verbs for eating is difficult to convey in English] this bread will live _forever_." ^[Literally "for the age"]

###### v59
He said these _things_ _while_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("teaching") which is understood as temporal] teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.

###### v60
Thus many of his disciples, _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] said, "This saying is hard! Who can understand it?"

###### v61
But Jesus, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("knew") which is understood as causal] knew within himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, "Does this cause you to be offended?

###### v62
Then _what_ if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?

###### v63
The Spirit is the one who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.

###### v64
But there are some of you who do not believe." (For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.)

###### v65
And he said, "Because of this I said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father."

###### v66
For this _reason_ many of his disciples _drew back_ ^[Literally "went away to the things behind"] and were not walking with him any longer.

###### v67
So Jesus said to the twelve, "You do not want to go away also, _do you_?" ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_do you_"]

###### v68
Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.

###### v69
And we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God."

###### v70
Jesus replied to them, "Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is the devil?"

###### v71
(Now he was speaking about Judas _son_ of Simon Iscariot, because this one--one of the twelve--was going to betray him.)
