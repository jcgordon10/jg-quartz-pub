###### v1
And after these _things_ Jesus was going about in Galilee. For he did not want to go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.

###### v2
Now the feast of the Jews--the _feast of_ Tabernacles--was near.

###### v3
So his brothers said to him, "Depart from here and go to Judea, so that your disciples also can see your works that you are doing.

###### v4
For no one does anything in secret and _yet_ he himself desires to be _publicly recognized_. ^[Literally "with openness"] If you are doing these _things_, reveal yourself to the world!"

###### v5
(For not even his brothers believed in him.)

###### v6
So Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.

###### v7
The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I am testifying about it, that its deeds are evil.

###### v8
You go up to the feast. I am not ^[Most manuscripts read "not yet" here, but this is obviously an easier reading intended to reconcile the statement with Jesus' later actions] going up to this feast, because my time is not yet completed. ^[Or "fulfilled"]

###### v9
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had said") which is understood as temporal] had said these _things_, he remained in Galilee.

###### v10
But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but (as it were) in secret.

###### v11
So the Jews were looking for him at the feast, and were saying, "Where is he?"

###### v12
And there was a lot of grumbling concerning him among the crowds; some were saying, "He is a good _man_," but others were saying, "No, but he deceives the crowd."

###### v13
However, no one was speaking openly about him for fear of the Jews.

###### v14
_Now when the feast was already half over_, ^[Literally "now it being already in the middle of the feast"] Jesus went to the temple _courts_ ^[Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] and began to teach. ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to teach")]

###### v15
Then the Jews were astonished, saying, "How does this man _possess knowledge_, ^[Literally "know letters"] _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("been taught") which is understood as causal] has not been taught?"

###### v16
So Jesus answered them and said, "My teaching is not mine, but _is_ from the one who sent me.

###### v17
If anyone wants to do his will, he will know about my ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] teaching, whether it is from God or I am speaking from myself.

###### v18
The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory. But the one who seeks the glory of the one who sent him--this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

###### v19
Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you carries out the law? Why do you seek to kill me?"

###### v20
The crowd replied, "You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?"

###### v21
Jesus answered and said to them, "I performed one work, and you are all astonished.

###### v22
Because of this Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.

###### v23
If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses would not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a whole man well ^[Or "a man entirely well"] on the Sabbath?

###### v24
Do not judge according to outward appearance, but judge according to righteous judgment!"

###### v25
Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say, ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] "Is this not _the one_ whom they are seeking to kill?

###### v26
And behold, he is speaking openly and they are saying nothing to him! Can it be that the rulers truly know that this man is the Christ?

###### v27
Yet we know where this man is from, but the Christ, whenever he comes--no one knows where he is from!"

###### v28
Then Jesus cried out in the temple _courts_, ^[*Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] teaching and saying, "You both know me and you know where I am from! And I have not come from myself, but the one who sent me is true, whom you do not know.

###### v29
I know him, because I am from him and he sent me."

###### v30
So they were seeking to seize him, and no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.

###### v31
But from the crowd many believed in him and were saying, "Whenever the Christ comes, he will not perform more signs than this man has done, _will he_?" ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_will he_"]

###### v32
The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these _things_ about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers in order _to take him into custody _. ^[Literally "that they could seize him"]

###### v33
Then Jesus said, "Yet a little time I am with you, and I am going to the one who sent me.

###### v34
You will seek me and will not find _me_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] ^[Some manuscripts explicitly state "me"] and where I am, you cannot come."

###### v35
So the Jews said to one another, "Where _is_ this one going to go, that we will not find him? He is not going to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, _is he_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_is he_"]

###### v36
What is this saying that he said, 'You will seek me and will not find _me_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] ^[Some manuscripts explicitly state "me"] and where I am, you cannot come'?"

###### v37
Now on the last day of the feast--the great _day_--Jesus stood and cried out, saying, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, and let him drink,

###### v38
the one who believes in me. ^[An alternative punctuation of vv. [[John-07#v37|37–38]][[John-07#v38|]] reads: "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and let him drink. 38 The one who believes in me, just as the scripture said, 'Out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.'"] Just as the scripture said, 'Out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.'" ^[A quotation from the Old Testament of uncertain origin; texts most often suggested are [[Isa-44#v3|Isa 44:3]]; [[Isa-55#v1|55:1]]; [[Isa-58#v11|58:11]]; [[Zech-14#v8|Zech 14:8]]]

###### v39
Now he said this concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were about to receive. For the Spirit was not yet _given_, ^[A few manuscripts supply the participle "given" here; while it is unlikely this represents the original reading, many English versions nevertheless supply "given" to avoid the impression that the Spirit did not exist prior to this point] because Jesus had not yet been glorified.)

###### v40
Then, _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard these words, _some_ from the crowd began to say, ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] "This man is truly the Prophet!"

###### v41
Others were saying, "This man is the Christ!" But others were saying, "No, for the Christ does not come from Galilee, _does he_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_does he_"]

###### v42
Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"

###### v43
So there was a division in the crowd because of him.

###### v44
And some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.

###### v45
So the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, "_Why_ ^[Literally "because of what"] did you not bring him?"

###### v46
The officers replied, "Never has a man spoken like this!"

###### v47
Then the Pharisees replied to them, "You have not also been deceived, _have you_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_have you_"]

###### v48
_None_ ^[Literally "not anyone"] of the rulers or of the Pharisees have believed in him, _have they_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_have they_"]

###### v49
But this crowd who does not know the law is accursed!"

###### v50
Nicodemus, the one who came to him previously--who was one of them--said to them,

###### v51
"Our law does not condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing, _does it_?" ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_does it_"]

###### v52
They answered and said to him, "You are not also from Galilee, _are you_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_are you_"] Investigate and see that a prophet does not arise from Galilee!"  [[

###### v53
\[\[And each one went to his _own_ house. ^[[[John-07#v53|John 7:53–8:11]] is not found in the earliest and best manuscripts and was almost certainly not an original part of the Gospel of John; one significant group of Greek manuscripts places it after [[Luke-21#v38|Luke 21:38]]]
