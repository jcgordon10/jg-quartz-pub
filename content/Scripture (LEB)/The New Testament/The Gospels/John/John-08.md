###### v1
But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

###### v2
Now early in the morning he came again to the temple _courts_. ^[*Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] And all the people were coming, ^[Some manuscripts have "were coming to him"] and he sat down _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("sat down") has been translated as a finite verb] began to teach ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to teach")] them.

###### v3
Now the scribes and the Pharisees brought to him a woman ^[Some manuscripts have "brought a woman"] caught in adultery. And standing her in _their_ midst,

###### v4
they said to him, testing _him_, ^[Some manuscripts omit "testing _him_"] "Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery!

###### v5
Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?"

###### v6
(Now they were saying this to test him, so that they would have _an occasion_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to bring charges against him.) But Jesus, bending down, began to write ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to write")] with _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] finger on the ground, taking no notice. ^[Some manuscripts omit "taking no notice"]

###### v7
And when they persisted in asking him, straightening up he said ^[Some manuscripts have "he straightened up and said"] to them, "The _one_ of you without sin, let him throw the first stone at her!"

###### v8
And bending down again, he wrote on the ground.

###### v9
Now _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] being convicted by their conscience, ^[Some manuscripts omit "being convicted by their conscience"] they began to depart, ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to depart")] one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus ^[Some manuscripts have "he"] was left alone--and the woman who was in _their_ midst.

###### v10
So Jesus, straightening up and seeing no one except the woman, ^[Some manuscripts omit "and seeing no one except the woman"] said to her, "Where are those accusers of yours? ^[Some manuscripts have "said to her, 'Woman, where are they?"] Does no one condemn you?"

###### v11
And she said, "No one, Lord." So Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go, and ^[Some manuscripts have "and from now on"] sin no more."\]\] ^[[[John-07#v53|John 7:53–8:11]] is not found in the earliest and best manuscripts and was almost certainly not an original part of the Gospel of John; one significant group of Greek manuscripts places it after [[Luke-21#v38|Luke 21:38]]]

###### v12
Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, "I am the light of the world! The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."

###### v13
So the Pharisees said to him, "You testify concerning yourself! Your testimony is not true."

###### v14
Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I testify concerning myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I have come from or where I am going.

###### v15
You judge according to externals; I do not judge anyone.

###### v16
But even if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.

###### v17
And even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true. ^[An allusion to [[Deut-17#v6|Deut 17:6]]]

###### v18
I am the one who testifies concerning myself, and the Father who sent me testifies concerning me."

###### v19
So they were saying to him, "Where is your father?" Jesus replied, "You know neither me nor my Father! If you had known me, you would have known my Father also."

###### v20
He spoke these words by the treasury _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("teaching") which is understood as temporal] teaching in the temple _courts_, ^[*Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] and no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.

###### v21
So he said to them again, "I am going away, and you will seek me and will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come!"

###### v22
Then the Jews began to say, ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] "Perhaps he will kill himself, because he is saying, 'Where I am going you cannot come.'"

###### v23
And he said to them, "You are from below; I am from above. You are from this world; I am not from this world.

###### v24
Thus I said to you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am _he_, you will die in your sins."

###### v25
So they began to say to him, ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] "Who are you?" Jesus said to them, "_What_ ^[Literally "that which"] I have been saying to you _from_ the beginning.

###### v26
I have many _things_ to say and to judge concerning you, but the one who sent me is true, and _the things_ which I heard from him, these _things_ I say to the world."

###### v27
(They did not know that he was speaking to them about the Father.)

###### v28
Then Jesus said, ^[Some manuscripts have "said to them"] "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will recognize that I am _he_, and I do nothing from myself, but just as the Father taught me, I say these _things_.

###### v29
And the one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do the things that are pleasing to him."

###### v30
_While_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was saying")] he was saying these _things_, many believed in him.

###### v31
Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him, "If you continue in my word you are truly my disciples,

###### v32
and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."

###### v33
They replied to him, "We are descendants of Abraham and have not been enslaved to anyone at any time. How do you say, 'You will become free'?"

###### v34
Jesus replied to them, "Truly, truly I say to you, that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.

###### v35
And the slave does not remain in the household _forever_; ^[Literally "for the age"] the son remains _forever_. ^[Literally "for the age"]

###### v36
So if the son sets you free, you will be truly free.

###### v37
I know that you are descendants of Abraham. But you are seeking to kill me, because my word makes no progress among you.

###### v38
I speak _the things_ that I have seen with the Father; so also you do _the things_ that you have heard from the Father."

###### v39
They answered and said to him, "Abraham is our father!" Jesus said to them, "If you are children of Abraham, do the deeds of Abraham!

###### v40
But now you are seeking to kill me, a man who spoke to you the truth which I heard from God. This Abraham did not do.

###### v41
You are doing the deeds of your father!"
They said ^[Some manuscripts have "Then they said"] to him, "We were not born from sexual immorality! We have one father, God!"

###### v42
Jesus said to them, "If God were your father, you would love me, for I have come forth from God and have come. For I have not come from myself, but that one sent me.

###### v43
_Why_ ^[Literally "because of what"] do you not understand my way of speaking? Because you are not able to listen to my message.

###### v44
You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father! That one was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand firm in the truth, because truth is not in him. Whenever he speaks the lie, he speaks from his own _nature_, ^[*The word "_nature_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] because he is a liar and the father _of lies_. ^[Literally "of it"]

###### v45
But because I am telling the truth, you do not believe me.

###### v46
Who among you convicts me concerning sin? If I am telling the truth, _why_ ^[Literally "because of what"] do you not believe me?

###### v47
The one who is from God listens to the words of God. Because of this you do not listen--because you are not of God."

###### v48
The Jews answered and said to him, "Do we not correctly say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"

###### v49
Jesus replied, "I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me!

###### v50
But I do not seek my _own_ glory. There is one who seeks and judges!

###### v51
Truly, truly I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never experience death _forever_." ^[Literally "for the age"]

###### v52
The Jews ^[Some manuscripts have "Then the Jews"] said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham and the prophets died, and you say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death _forever_.' ^[Literally "for the age"]

###### v53
You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, _are you_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_are you_"] And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself _to be_?"

###### v54
Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. The one who glorifies me is my Father, _about_ whom you say, 'He is our God.'

###### v55
And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you! But I know him and I keep his word.

###### v56
Abraham your father rejoiced that he would see my day, and he saw _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and was glad."

###### v57
So the Jews said to him, "_You are_ ^[Literally "you have"] not yet fifty years _old_, and have you seen Abraham?"

###### v58
Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am!"

###### v59
Then they picked up stones in order to throw _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] at him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple _courts_. ^[*Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself]
