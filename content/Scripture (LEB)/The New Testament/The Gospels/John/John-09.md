###### v1
And _as he_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("went away") which is understood as temporal] went away, he saw a man blind from birth.

###### v2
And his disciples asked him, saying, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?"

###### v3
Jesus replied, "Neither this man sinned nor his parents, but _it happened_ ^[The words "_it happened_" are not in the Greek text but are implied] so that the works of God could be revealed in him.

###### v4
It is necessary _for_ us to do the deeds of the one who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work!

###### v5
While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."

###### v6
_When he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had said") which is understood as temporal] had said these _things_, he spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva, and smeared the clay on his eyes.

###### v7
And he said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which is translated "sent"). So he went and washed and came back seeing.

###### v8
Then the neighbors and those who saw him previously (because he was a beggar) began to say, ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] "Is this man not the one who used to sit and beg?"

###### v9
Others were saying, "It is this man"; others were saying, "No, but he is like him." That one was saying, "I am _he_!"

###### v10
So they began to say ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] to him, "How ^[Some manuscripts have "Then how"] were your eyes opened?"

###### v11
He replied, "The man who is called Jesus made clay and smeared _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] on my eyes and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash!' So I went, and I washed, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the two previous participles ("went" and "washed") have been translated as finite verbs] I received sight."

###### v12
And they said to him, "Where is that man?" He said, "I do not know."

###### v13
They brought him--the one formerly blind--to the Pharisees.

###### v14
(Now the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes was the Sabbath.)

###### v15
So the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received sight. And he said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see."

###### v16
So some of the Pharisees were saying, "This man is not from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath!" Others ^[Some manuscripts have "But others"] were saying, "How can a man _who is_ a sinner perform such signs?" And there was a division among them.

###### v17
So they said to the blind man again, "What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?" And he said, "He is a prophet."

###### v18
So the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received sight, until they summoned the parents of the one ^[Literally "of him"] who received sight.

###### v19
And they asked them, saying, "Is this man your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?"

###### v20
So his parents answered and said, "We know that this man is our son, and that he was born blind.

###### v21
But how he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. Ask him! _He is a mature adult_; ^[Literally "he has maturity"] he will speak for himself!"

###### v22
(His parents said these _things_ because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already decided that if anyone should confess him _to be_ Christ, he would be expelled from the synagogue.

###### v23
Because of this his parents said, "_He is a mature adult_; ^[Literally "he has maturity"] ask him.")

###### v24
So they summoned the man who had been blind for the second time and said to him, "Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner!"

###### v25
Then that man replied, "Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One _thing_ I know--that _although I_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as concessive] was blind, now I see!"

###### v26
So they said to him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"

###### v27
He replied to them, "I told you already and you did not listen! Why do you want to hear _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] again? You do not want to become his disciples also, _do you_?" ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_do you_"]

###### v28
They reviled ^[Some manuscripts have "And they reviled"] him and said, "You are his disciple! But we are disciples of Moses!

###### v29
We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from."

###### v30
The man answered and said to them, "For the remarkable thing is this, that you do not know where he is from, and he opened my eyes!

###### v31
We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if someone is devout and does his will, he listens to this one.

###### v32
From _time immemorial_ ^[Literally "the age"] it has not been heard that someone opened the eyes of one born blind.

###### v33
If this man were not from God, he would not be able to do anything!"

###### v34
They answered and said to him, "You were born completely in sin, and are you attempting to teach ^[Here the present tense is translated as a conative present ("attempting to teach")] us?" And they threw him out.

###### v35
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"

###### v36
He answered and said, "And who is _he_, sir, that I may believe in him?"

###### v37
Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and he is the one who is speaking with you."  [[

###### v38
And he said, "I believe, Lord!" and he worshiped him.

###### v39
And Jesus said,]] ^[A number of important manuscripts lack v. [[John-09#v38|38]] and the first part of v. [[John-09#v39|39]] ("and Jesus said")] "For judgment I have come into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind!"

###### v40
_Some_ of the Pharisees who were with him heard these _things_ and said to him, "We are not also blind, _are we_?" ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_are we_"]

###### v41
Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now you say, 'We see,' your sin remains.
