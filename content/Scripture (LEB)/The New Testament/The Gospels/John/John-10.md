###### v1
"Truly, truly I say to you, the one who does not enter through the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up at some other place--that one is a thief and a robber.

###### v2
But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

###### v3
For this one the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.

###### v4
Whenever he sends out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.

###### v5
And they will never follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers."

###### v6
Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what it was that he was saying to them.

###### v7
Then Jesus said to them ^[Some manuscripts omit "to them"] again, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.

###### v8
All those who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep do not listen to them.

###### v9
I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will come in and will go out and will find pasture.

###### v10
The thief _comes only_ ^[Literally "does not come except"] so that he can steal and kill and destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and have _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] abundantly.

###### v11
"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

###### v12
The hired hand, who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf approaching and abandons the sheep and runs away--and the wolf seizes them and scatters _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]--

###### v13
because he is a hired hand and _he is not concerned_ ^[Literally "it is not a concern to him"] about the sheep.

###### v14
"I am the good shepherd, and I know my _own_, and my _own_ know me,

###### v15
just as the Father knows me and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.

###### v16
And I have other sheep which are not from this fold. I must bring these also, and they will hear my voice, and they will become one flock--one shepherd.

###### v17
Because of this the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take possession of it again.

###### v18
No one takes it from me, but I lay it down _voluntarily_. ^[Literally "from myself"] I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take possession of it again. This commandment I received from my Father."

###### v19
Again there was a division among the Jews because of these words.

###### v20
And many of them were saying, "He has a demon and is out of his mind! Why do you listen to him?"

###### v21
Others were saying, "These are not the words of one who is possessed by a demon! A demon is not able to open the eyes of the blind, _is it_?" ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_is it_"]

###### v22
Then the feast of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,

###### v23
and Jesus was walking in the temple in the Portico of Solomon.

###### v24
So the Jews surrounded him and began to say ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] to him, "_How long will you keep us in suspense_? ^[Literally "until when will you take away our life"] If you are the Christ, tell us plainly!"

###### v25
Jesus answered them, "I told you and you do not believe! The deeds that I do in the name of my Father, these testify about me.

###### v26
But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep!

###### v27
My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.

###### v28
And I give them eternal life, and they will never perish _forever_, ^[Literally "for the age"] and no one will seize them out of my hand.

###### v29
My Father, who has given _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to me, is greater than all, and no one can seize _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] from the Father's hand.

###### v30
The Father and I are one."

###### v31
Then ^[Some manuscripts omit "Then"] the Jews picked up stones again so that they could stone him.

###### v32
Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?"

###### v33
The Jews answered him, "We are not going to stone you concerning a good deed, but concerning blasphemy, and because you, _although you_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as concessive] are a man, make yourself _to be_ God!"

###### v34
Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law, 'I said, "You are gods"'? ^[A quotation from [[Ps-82#v6|Ps 82:6]] (in common usage "law" could refer to the entire Old Testament)]

###### v35
If he called them 'gods' to whom the word of God came--and the scripture cannot be broken--

###### v36
do you say about _he_ whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?

###### v37
If I do not do the deeds of my Father, do not believe me.

###### v38
But if I am doing _them_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] even if you do not believe me, believe the deeds, so that you may know and understand that the Father _is_ in me and I _am_ in the Father."

###### v39
So they were seeking again to seize him, and he departed out of their hand.

###### v40
And he went away again on the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at an earlier time, and he stayed there.

###### v41
And many came to him and began to say, ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] "John performed no sign, but everything John said about this man was true!"

###### v42
And many believed in him there.
