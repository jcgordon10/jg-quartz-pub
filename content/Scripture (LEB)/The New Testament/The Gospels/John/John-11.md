###### v1
Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.

###### v2
(Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)

###### v3
So the sisters sent _word_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to him, saying, "Lord, behold, _the one_ whom you love is sick."

###### v4
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] Jesus said, "This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it."

###### v5
(Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.)

###### v6
So when he heard that he was sick, then he remained in the place _where_ ^[Literally "in which"] he was two days.

###### v7
Then after this he said to the disciples, "Let us go to Judea again."

###### v8
The disciples said to him, "Rabbi, the Jews were seeking just now to stone you, and are you going there again?"

###### v9
Jesus replied, Are _there_ not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks around in the daylight, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.

###### v10
But if anyone walks around in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.

###### v11
He said these _things_, and after this he said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I can awaken him."

###### v12
So the disciples said to him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well."

###### v13
(Now Jesus had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about _real sleep_. ^[Literally "the sleep of slumber"])

###### v14
So Jesus then said to them plainly, "Lazarus has died,

###### v15
and I am glad _for your sake_ ^[Literally "for the sake of you"] that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him."

###### v16
Then Thomas (the one who is called Didymus) ^["Didymus" means "the twin" in Greek] said to his fellow disciples, "Let us go also, so that we may die with him."

###### v17
So _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("arrived") which is understood as temporal] arrived, Jesus found he had already _been_ four days in the tomb.

###### v18
(Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia. ^[A "stade" or "stadium" (plur. "stadia") is about 607 ft (187 m), so this was just under two miles (3 km)]

###### v19
So many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to console them concerning their ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] brother.)

###### v20
Now Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house.

###### v21
So Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

###### v22
Even ^[Some manuscripts have "But even"] now I know that whatever you ask God, God will grant you."

###### v23
Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."

###### v24
Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."

###### v25
Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live,

###### v26
and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die _forever_. ^[Literally "for the age"] Do you believe this?"

###### v27
She said to him, "Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world."

###### v28
And _when she_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had said") which is understood as temporal] had said this, she went and called her sister Mary privately, saying, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."

###### v29
So that one, when she heard _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] got up quickly and went to him.

###### v30
(Now Jesus has not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha went to meet him.)

###### v31
So the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her, _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw Mary--that she stood up quickly and went out--followed her, _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("thought") which is understood as causal] thought that she was going to the tomb in order to weep there.

###### v32
Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the participle ("saw") has been translated as a finite verb in keeping with English style] saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."

###### v33
Then Jesus, when he saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled within himself.

###### v34
And he said, "Where have you laid him?" They said to him, "Lord, come and see."

###### v35
Jesus wept.

###### v36
So the Jews were saying, "See how he loved him!"

###### v37
But some of them said, "Was not this man who opened the eyes of the blind able to do _something_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] so that this man also would not have died?"

###### v38
Then Jesus, deeply moved within himself again, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying on it.

###### v39
Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of the one who had died, said to him, "Lord, he is stinking already, because it has been four days."

###### v40
Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"

###### v41
So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] eyes above and said, "Father, I give thanks to you that you hear me.

###### v42
And I know that you always hear me, but for the sake of the crowd standing around I said _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] so that they may believe that you sent me."

###### v43
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had said") which is understood as temporal] had said these _things_, he cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"

###### v44
The one who had died came out, his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] feet and his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hands bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped with a facecloth. Jesus said to them, "Untie him and let him go."

###### v45
Then many of the Jews who had come with Mary and saw _the things_ which he did believed in him.

###### v46
But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them _the things_ which Jesus had done.

###### v47
So the chief priests and the Pharisees called together the Sanhedrin and said, "What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs!

###### v48
If we allow him _to go on_ in this way, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place ^[Generally understood to be a reference to the Jerusalem temple] and our ^[Literally "both the place and the nation of us"; the possessive pronoun is repeated in the translation (rather than the article) in keeping with English style] nation."

###### v49
But a certain one of them, Caiaphas (who was high priest in that year), said to them, "You do not know anything at all!

###### v50
Nor do you consider that it is profitable for you that one man should die for the people, and the whole nation not perish."

###### v51
(Now he did not say this from himself, but being high priest in that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,

###### v52
and not for the nation only, but also that the children of God who are scattered would be gathered into one.)

###### v53
So from that day they resolved that they should kill him.

###### v54
So Jesus was no longer walking openly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples.

###### v55
Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the _surrounding_ country before the Passover, so that they could purify themselves.

###### v56
So they were looking for Jesus, and were speaking with one another _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("standing") which is understood as temporal] standing in the temple _courts_, ^[*Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] "What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?"

###### v57
(Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, they should report _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] in order that they could arrest him.)
