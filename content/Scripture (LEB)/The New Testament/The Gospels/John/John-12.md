###### v1
Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.

###### v2
So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining at table with him.

###### v3
Then Mary took a pound ^[The Greek term refers to a Roman pound, 327.45 grams (approximately 12 ounces)] of ointment of very valuable genuine nard _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took") has been translated as a finite verb] anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.

###### v4
But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) said,

###### v5
"_Why_ ^[Literally "because of what"] was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"

###### v6
(Now he said this not because _he was concerned_ ^[Literally "it was a concern to him"] about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, he used to steal what was put into _it_.) ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v7
So Jesus said, "Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my preparation for burial.

###### v8
For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have me."

###### v9
Now a large crowd ^[Some manuscripts have "the large crowd"] of Jews found out that he was there, and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they could see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the dead.

###### v10
So the chief priests decided that they would kill Lazarus also,

###### v11
because on account of him many of the Jews were going and believing in Jesus.

###### v12
On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

###### v13
took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, and began crying out,
"Hosanna!
Blessed _is_ the one who comes in the name of the Lord, ^[A quotation from [[Ps-118#v25|Ps 118:25–26]][[Ps-118#v26|]]]
even the king of Israel!"

###### v14
So Jesus found a young donkey _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("found") has been translated as a finite verb] sat on it, just as it is written,

###### v15
"Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion!
Behold, your king is coming,
seated on the foal of a donkey!" ^[A quotation from [[Zech-09#v9|Zech 9:9]]]

###### v16
(His disciples did not understand these _things_ at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these _things_ had been written about him and they did these _things_ to him.)

###### v17
So the crowd who was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify.

###### v18
Because of this also the crowd went to meet him, for they had heard _that_ he had performed this sign.

###### v19
So the Pharisees said to one another, "You see that you are accomplishing nothing! Behold, the world has gone after him."

###### v20
Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up in order to worship at the feast.

###### v21
So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and began asking him saying, "Sir, we want to see Jesus."

###### v22
Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.

###### v23
And Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man will be glorified.

###### v24
Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("falls") has been translated as a finite verb] dies, it remains _by_ itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.

###### v25
The one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world preserves it for eternal life.

###### v26
If anyone serves me, he must follow me, and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.

###### v27
"Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, deliver me from this hour'? But for this _reason_ I have come to this hour!

###### v28
Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have both glorified _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and I will glorify _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] again."

###### v29
Now the crowd that stood _there_ and heard _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] said _it had thundered_. ^[Literally "thunder had happened"] Others were saying, "An angel has spoken to him!"

###### v30
Jesus answered and said, "This voice has not happened for my sake, but _for_ your sake.

###### v31
Now is the judgment of this world! Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out!

###### v32
And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all _people_ to myself."

###### v33
(Now he said this to indicate by what sort of death he was going to die.)

###### v34
Then the crowd replied to him, "We have heard from the law that the Christ remains _forever_! ^[Literally "for the age"; probably an allusion to [[Ps-89#v35|Ps 89:35–37]][[Ps-89#v36|]][[Ps-89#v37|]] (in common usage "law" could refer to the entire Old Testament)] And how do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?"

###### v35
So Jesus said to them, "Yet a little time the light is with you! Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness does not overtake you! And the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.

###### v36
While you have the light, believe in the light, in order that you may become sons of light." Jesus said these _things_, and _then_ he went away _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went away") has been translated as a finite verb] was hidden from them.

###### v37
But as many signs _as_ he had performed before them, they did not believe in him,

###### v38
in order that the word of the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said,
"Lord, who has believed our message?
And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" ^[A quotation from [[Isa-53#v1|Isa 53:1]]]

###### v39
For this _reason_ they were not able to believe, because again Isaiah said,

###### v40
"He has blinded their eyes
and hardened their hearts,
lest they see with _their_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] eyes
and understand with _their_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hearts
and turn, and I heal them." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-06#v10|Isa 6:10]]]

###### v41
Isaiah said these _things_ because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him.

###### v42
Yet despite that, even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue.

###### v43
For they loved the praise of men more than praise from God.

###### v44
But Jesus cried out and said, "The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me,

###### v45
and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me.

###### v46
I have come _as_ a light into the world, in order that everyone who believes in me will not remain in the darkness.

###### v47
And if anyone hears my words and does not observe _them_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] I will not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.

###### v48
The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has one who judges him; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.

###### v49
For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father himself who sent me _has commanded me_ ^[Literally "has given me commandment"] what I should say and what I should speak.

###### v50
And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So _the things_ that I say, just as the Father said to me, thus I say."
