###### v1
Now before the feast of Passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied in keeping with English style] having loved _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] own in the world, loved them to the end.

###### v2
And _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was taking place")] a dinner was taking place, _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("put")] the devil had already put into the heart of Judas _son_ of Simon Iscariot that he should betray him,

###### v3
_because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("knew") which is understood as causal] knew that the Father had given him all _things_ into _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hands, and that he had come forth from God and was going away to God,

###### v4
he got up from the dinner and took off _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] outer clothing, and taking a towel, tied _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] around himself.

###### v5
Then he poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] dry with the towel _which he had tied around himself_. ^[Literally "with which he was girded"]

###### v6
Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"

###### v7
Jesus answered and said to him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand after these _things_."

###### v8
Peter said to him, "You will never wash my feet _forever_!" ^[Literally "for the age"] Jesus replied to him, "Unless I wash you, you do not have a share with me."

###### v9
Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also _my_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hands and _my_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] head!"

###### v10
Jesus said to him, "The one who has bathed _only needs_ ^[Literally "does not have need except"] to wash _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not all _of you_."

###### v11
(For he knew the one who would betray him; because of this he said, "Not all _of you_ are clean.")

###### v12
So when he had washed their feet and taken his outer clothing and reclined at table again, he said to them, "Do you understand what I have done for you?

###### v13
You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and you speak correctly, for I am.

###### v14
If then I--_your_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] Lord and Teacher--wash your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.

###### v15
For I have given you an example, that just as I have done for you, you also do.

###### v16
Truly, truly I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor a messenger greater than the one who sent him.

###### v17
If you understand these _things_, you are blessed if you do them.

###### v18
"I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, 'The one who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.' ^[A quotation from [[Ps-41#v9|Ps 41:9]]]

###### v19
From now _on_ I am telling you before _it_ happens, in order that when _it_ happens you may believe that I am _he_. ^[*Here the predicate nominative ("_he_") is understood, but must be supplied in the translation]

###### v20
Truly, truly I say to you, the one who receives anyone I send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me."

###### v21
_When he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had said") which is understood as temporal] had said these _things_, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified and said, "Truly, truly I say to you that one of you will betray me."

###### v22
The disciples began looking ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began looking")] at one another, uncertain about whom he was speaking.

###### v23
One of his disciples--the one whom Jesus loved--was reclining _close beside_ ^[Literally "in the bosom of" (a position dictated by ancient banqueting practice)] Jesus.

###### v24
So Simon Peter gestured for this one to inquire who it was about whom he was speaking.

###### v25
He leaned back ^[Some manuscripts have "Then he leaned back"] accordingly against Jesus' chest _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("leaned back") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, "Lord, who is it?"

###### v26
Jesus replied, "It is he to whom I dip the piece of bread and give _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to him." Then _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("dipping") which is understood as temporal] dipping the piece of bread, he gave _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] ^[Some manuscripts have "after dipping the piece of bread, he took _it_ and gave _it_"] to Judas _son_ of Simon Iscariot.

###### v27
And after the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, "What you are doing, do quickly!"

###### v28
(Now no one of those reclining at table knew for what _reason_ he said this to him.

###### v29
For some were thinking because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, "Purchase _what we need_ ^[Literally "of which we have need"] for the feast," or that he should give something to the poor.)

###### v30
So _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had taken") which is understood as temporal] had taken the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.

###### v31
Then, when he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.

###### v32
If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will glorify him immediately.

###### v33
Children, yet a little _time_ I am with you. You will seek me and just as I said to the Jews, "Where I am going you cannot come," now I say also to you.

###### v34
"A new commandment I give to you: that you love one another--just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.

###### v35
By this everyone will know that you are my disciples--if you have love for one another."

###### v36
Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus replied, ^[Some manuscripts have "replied to him"] "Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later."

###### v37
Peter said to him, "Lord, why am I not able to follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!"

###### v38
Jesus replied, "Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly I say to you, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times!
