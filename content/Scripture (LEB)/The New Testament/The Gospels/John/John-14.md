###### v1
"Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe ^[Or simply "Believe"; the verb form can be either indicative (e.g., KJV, NAB, NLT) or imperative (e.g., NIV, NRSV, ESV)] in God; believe ^[Like the previous verb "believe" this form could also be either indicative or imperative, though most English versions regard it as imperative] also in me.

###### v2
In my Father's house there are many dwelling places; but if not, I would have told you, because ^[A large number of manuscripts, many of them later, lack "because"] I am going away to prepare a place for you.

###### v3
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, so that where I am, you may be also.

###### v4
And you know the way where I am going."

###### v5
Thomas said to him, "Lord, we do not know where you are going. How are we able to know the way?"

###### v6
Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

###### v7
If you had known me, you would have known ^[Some manuscripts have "If you have known me, you will know"] my Father also. From now on ^[Some manuscripts have "And from now on"] you know him and have seen him."

###### v8
Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us."

###### v9
Jesus said to him, "Am I with you so long a time and you have not known me, Philip? The one who has seen me has seen the Father! How can you say, 'Show us the Father?'

###### v10
Do you not believe that I _am_ in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from myself, but the Father residing in me does his works.

###### v11
Believe me that I _am_ in the Father and the Father _is_ in me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves.

###### v12
Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes in me, the works that I am doing he will do also, and he will do greater _works_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] than these because I am going to the Father.

###### v13
And _whatever_ ^[Literally "anything which"] you ask in my name, I will do this, in order that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

###### v14
If you ask me anything in my name, I will do _it_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v15
"If you love me, you will keep my commandments.

###### v16
And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, in order that he may be with you _forever_ ^[Literally "for the age"]--

###### v17
the Spirit of truth, whom the world is not able to receive, because it does not see him or know _him_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] You know him, because he resides with you and will be in you.

###### v18
"I will not leave you _as_ orphans; I am coming to you.

###### v19
Yet a little _time_ and the world will see me no longer, but you will see me; because I live, you also will live.

###### v20
On that day you will know that I _am_ in my Father, and you _are_ in me, and I _am_ in you.

###### v21
The one who has my commandments and keeps them--that one is the one who loves me. And the one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will reveal myself to him."

###### v22
Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, why ^[Some manuscripts have "and why"] is it that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?"

###### v23
Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves me he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and _will take up residence with him_. ^[Literally "will make abode with him"]

###### v24
The one who does not love me does not keep my words, and the word that you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.

###### v25
These _things_ I have spoken to you _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("residing") which is understood as temporal] residing with you.

###### v26
But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name--that one will teach you all _things_, and will remind you of everything that I said to you.

###### v27
"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you--not as the world gives, I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] be afraid.

###### v28
You have heard that I said to you, 'I am going away, and I am coming to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I _am_.

###### v29
And now I have told you before _it_ happens, so that when it happens, you may believe.

###### v30
I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has _no power_ ^[Literally "nothing"] _over_ ^[Literally "in"] me.

###### v31
But so that the world may know that I love the Father, and just as the Father has commanded me, thus I am doing. Get up, let us go from here!
