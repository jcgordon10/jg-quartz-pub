###### v1
"I have said these _things_ to you so that you will not fall away.

###### v2
_They will expel you from the synagogue_, ^[Literally "they will make you expelled from the synagogue"] but an hour is coming that everyone who kills you will think they are offering service to God.

###### v3
And they will do these _things_ because they do not know the Father or me.

###### v4
But I have said these _things_ to you so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you about them.
"And I have not said these _things_ to you from the beginning, because I was with you.

###### v5
But now I am going away to the one who sent me, and none of you is asking me, 'Where are you going?'

###### v6
But because I have said these _things_ to you, sorrow has filled your hearts.

###### v7
But I tell you the truth, it is better for you that I go away. For if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.

###### v8
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("comes") which is understood as temporal] comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment:

###### v9
concerning sin, because they do not believe in me,

###### v10
and concerning righteousness, because I am going away to the Father and you will see me no more,

###### v11
and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.

###### v12
I still have many _things_ to say to you, but you are not able to bear _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] now.

###### v13
But when he--the Spirit of truth--comes, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak from himself, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will proclaim to you the things to come.

###### v14
He will glorify me, because he will take from what _is_ mine and will proclaim _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to you.

###### v15
Everything that the Father has is mine. For this _reason_ I said that he takes from what _is_ mine and will proclaim _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to you.

###### v16
"A little _while_ and you will see me no more, and again a little _while_ and you will see me.

###### v17
So some of his disciples said to one another, "What is this that he is saying to us, 'A little _while_ and you will not see me, and again a little _while_ and you will see me,' and 'Because I am going away to the Father'?"

###### v18
So they kept on saying, "What is this that he is saying, 'A little _while_'? We do not understand what he is speaking about!"

###### v19
Jesus knew that they were wanting to ask him, and he said to them, "Are you deliberating with one another about this--that I said, 'A little _while_, and you will not see me, and again a little _while_ and you will see me'?

###### v20
Truly, truly I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will change to joy.

###### v21
A woman, when she gives birth, experiences pain because her hour has come. But when _her_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] child is born, she no longer remembers the affliction, on account of the joy that a human being has been born into the world.

###### v22
So you also are experiencing sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy from you.

###### v23
And on that day you will ask me nothing. Truly, truly I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you.

###### v24
Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.

###### v25
"I have said these _things_ to you in figurative sayings. An hour is coming when I will speak to you in figurative sayings no longer, but I will tell you plainly about the Father.

###### v26
On that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf.

###### v27
For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.

###### v28
I have gone out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and am going to the Father."

###### v29
His disciples said, "Behold, now you are speaking _plainly_ ^[Literally "with plainness"] and are telling _us_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] no figurative saying!

###### v30
Now we know that you know everything and do not _need for_ ^[Literally "have need that"] anyone to ask you _questions_. ^[*Here the word "_questions_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] By this we believe that you have come from God."

###### v31
Jesus replied to them, "Now do you believe?

###### v32
Behold, an hour is coming--and has come--that you will be scattered each one to his own _home_, ^[Or "to his own things"; or "to his own people" (i.e., family); the Greek text is somewhat ambiguous here] and you will leave me alone. And I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

###### v33
I have said these _things_ to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but have courage! I have conquered the world."
