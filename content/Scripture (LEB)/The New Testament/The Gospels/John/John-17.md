###### v1
Jesus said these _things_, and lifting up his eyes to heaven he said, "Father, the hour has come! Glorify your Son, in order that your Son may glorify you--

###### v2
just as you have given him authority over all flesh, in order that he would give eternal life to them--everyone whom you have given him.

###### v3
Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.

###### v4
I have glorified you on earth _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("completing") which is understood as means] completing the work that you have given me _to do_. ^[Literally "that I may do it"]

###### v5
And now, Father, you glorify me _at your side_ ^[Literally "by the side of yourself"] with the glory that I had _at your side_ ^[Literally "by the side of you"] before the world existed.

"I have revealed your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me, and they have kept your word.

###### v7
Now they understand that all _the things_ that ^[Literally "whatever"] you have given me are from you,

###### v8
because the words that you gave to me I have given to them, and they received _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and know truly that I have come from you, and they have believed that you have sent me.

###### v9
I am asking on behalf of them. I am not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those whom you have given me, because they are yours,

###### v10
and all my _things_ are yours, and your _things_ _are_ mine, and I have been glorified in ^[Or "by"; or "through"] them.

###### v11
And I am no longer in the world, and they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given to me, so that they may be one, just as we _are_.

###### v12
When I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given to me, and guarded _them_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and none of them has perished except the son of destruction, in order that the scripture would be fulfilled.

###### v13
And now I am coming to you, and I am saying these _things_ in the world so that they may have my joy completed in themselves.

###### v14
I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world just as I am not of the world.

###### v15
I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from the evil one.

###### v16
They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

###### v17
Sanctify them in the truth--your word is truth.

###### v18

###### v22
And the glory that you have given to me, I have given to them, in order that they may be one, just as we _are_ one--

###### v23
I in them, and you in me, in order that they may be completed in one, so that the world may know that you sent me, and you have loved them just as you have loved me.

###### v24
