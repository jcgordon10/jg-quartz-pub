###### v1
_When_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had said") which is understood as temporal] Jesus had said these _things_, he went out with his disciples to the other side of the ravine of the Kidron, where _there_ was a garden into which he and his disciples entered.

###### v2
(Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, also knew about the place, because Jesus often gathered there with his disciples.)

###### v3
So Judas, taking the cohort and officers from the chief priests and from the Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.

###### v4
Then Jesus, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("knew") which is understood as causal] knew all the things that were coming upon him, went out and said to them, "Who are you looking for?"

###### v5
They replied to him, "Jesus the Nazarene." He said to them, "I am _he_." ^[*Here the predicate nominative is supplied from context in the English translation] (Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, was also standing with them.)

###### v6
So when he said to them, "I am _he_," ^[*Here the predicate nominative is supplied from context in the English translation] _they drew back_ ^[Literally "they went to the back"] and fell to the ground.

###### v7
Then he asked them again, "Who are you looking for?" And they said, "Jesus the Nazarene."

###### v8
Jesus replied, "I said to you that I am _he_! ^[*Here the predicate nominative is supplied from context in the English translation] So if you are looking for me, let these _men_ go,"

###### v9
in order that the word that he had spoken would be fulfilled: "Those whom you have given to me--I have not lost anyone of them." ^[A paraphrase of the statement in [[John-17#v12|John 17:12]]]

###### v10
Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. (Now the name of the slave was Malchus.)

###### v11
So Jesus said to Peter, "Put the sword into _its_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] sheath! The cup that the Father has given me--shall I not drink it?"

###### v12
Then the cohort and the military tribune and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and tied him up,

###### v13
and brought _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.

###### v14
(Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was better _that_ one man die for the people.)

###### v15
So Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. (Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.)

###### v16
But Peter was standing by the door outside. So the other disciple _who was_ known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.

###### v17
Then the female slave _who was_ the doorkeeper said to Peter, "You are not also _one_ of the disciples of this man, _are you_?" ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_are you_"] He said, "I am not!"

###### v18
(Now the slaves and the officers were standing there, having made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. And Peter was also standing there with them and warming himself.)

###### v19
So the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.

###### v20
Jesus replied to him, "I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple _courts_ ^[Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] where all the Jews assemble, and I have said nothing in secret.

###### v21
Why are you asking me? Ask those who heard what I have said to them! Behold, these _people_ know what I said."

###### v22
Now _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("had said")] he had said these _things_, one of the officers who was standing by gave a slap in the face to Jesus, saying, "Do you reply to the high priest in this way?"

###### v23
Jesus replied to him, "If I have spoken wrongly, testify about what _is_ wrong! But if _I have spoken_ ^[The phrase "I have spoken" is an implied repetition of the earlier phrase in this verse] correctly, why do you strike me?"

###### v24
Then Annas sent him, tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest.

###### v25
Now Simon Peter was standing there and warming himself. So they said to him, "You are not also _one_ of his disciples, _are you_?" ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_are you_"] He denied _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and said, "I am not!"

###### v26
One of the slaves of the high priest, who was related to the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?"

###### v27
So Peter denied _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] again, and immediately a rooster crowed.

###### v28
Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's residence. Now it was early, and they did not enter into the governor's residence so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover.

###### v29
So Pilate came outside to them and said, "What accusation do you bring against this man?"

###### v30
They answered and said to him, "If this man were not doing evil, we would not have handed him over to you!"

###### v31
So Pilate said to them, "You take him and judge him according to your law!" The Jews said to him, "It is not permitted for us to kill anyone,"

###### v32
in order that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled that he had spoken, indicating by what sort of death he was going to die.

###### v33
Then Pilate entered again into the governor's residence and summoned Jesus and said to him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"

###### v34
Jesus replied, "Do you say this from yourself, or have others said _this_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to you about me?"

###### v35
Pilate replied, "I am not a Jew, _am I_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_am I_"] Your people and the chief priests handed you over to me! What have you done?"

###### v36
Jesus replied, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here."

###### v37
Then Pilate said to him, "So then you are a king!" Jesus replied, "You say that I am a king. For this _reason_ I was born, and for this reason I have come into the world: in order that I can testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice."

###### v38
Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had said") which is understood as temporal] had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, "I find no basis for an accusation against him.

###### v39
But it is your custom that I release for you one _prisoner_ ^[The word "_prisoner_" is not in the Greek text, but is implied] at the Passover. So do you want _me_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to release for you the king of the Jews?"

###### v40
Then they shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" (Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.) ^[Or perhaps "robber"]
