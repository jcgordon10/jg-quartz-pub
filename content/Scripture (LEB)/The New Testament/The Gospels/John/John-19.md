###### v1
So then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. ^[*This verb has causative force in context; Pilate did not personally carry out the sentence]

###### v2
And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and placed _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] on his head, and put a purple robe on him,

###### v3
and were coming up to him and saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" and were giving him slaps in the face.

###### v4
And Pilate came outside again and said to them, "Behold, I am bringing him outside to you, so that you will know that I find no basis for an accusation against him."

###### v5
Then Jesus came outside wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, and he said to them, "Behold the man!"

###### v6
So when they saw him, the chief priests and the officers shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify!" Pilate said to them, "You take him and crucify _him_! ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] For I do not find a basis for an accusation against him."

###### v7
The Jews replied to him, "We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be the Son of God!"

###### v8
So when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid,

###### v9
and he entered into the governor's residence again and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus did not give him an answer.

###### v10
So Pilate said to him, "Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?"

###### v11
Jesus replied to him, "You would not have any authority over me unless it was given to you from above. For this _reason_ the one who handed me over to you has greater sin."

###### v12
From this _point on_ Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews shouted, saying, "If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar! Everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar!"

###### v13
So Pilate, _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard these words, brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat, in the place called The Stone Pavement (but _Gabbatha_ in Aramaic).

###### v14
(Now it was the day of preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, "Behold your king!"

###### v15
Then those shouted, "Away _with him_! Away _with him_! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your king?" The chief priests replied, "We do not have a king except Caesar!"

###### v16
So then he handed him over to them in order that he could be crucified.
So they took Jesus,

###### v17
and carrying for himself the cross, he went out to the _place_ called The Place of a Skull (which is called _Golgotha_ in Aramaic),

###### v18
where they crucified him, and with him two others, _one on each side_, ^[Literally "from here and from here"] and Jesus in the middle.

###### v19
And Pilate also wrote a notice and placed _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] on the cross, and it was written: "Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews."

###### v20
So many of the Jews read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, _and_ in Greek.

###### v21
Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write 'The king of the Jews,' but, 'He said, I am king of the Jews.'"

###### v22
Pilate replied, "What I have written, I have written."

###### v23
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothing and made four shares--for each soldier a share--and the tunic. (Now the tunic was seamless, woven from the top _in a single piece_.) ^[Literally "through the whole"]

###### v24
So they said to one another, "Let us not tear it apart, but cast lots for it, _to see_ whose it will be," so that the scripture would be fulfilled that says,
"They divided my garments among themselves,
and for my clothing they cast lots." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-22#v18|Ps 22:18]]]
Thus the soldiers did these _things_.

###### v25
Now his mother and the sister of his mother, Mary the _wife_ of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene were standing near the cross of Jesus.

###### v26
So Jesus, seeing _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, said to _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] mother, "Woman, behold your son!"

###### v27
Then he said to the disciple, "Behold your mother!" And from that hour the disciple took her into his own _home_.

###### v28
After this, Jesus, knowing that now at last everything was completed, in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty."

###### v29
A jar full of sour wine was standing there, so _they_ put a sponge full of the sour wine on a _branch of_ hyssop _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("put") has been translated as a finite verb] brought _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to his mouth.

###### v30
Then when he had received the sour wine, Jesus said, "It is completed," ^[Or (traditionally) "it is finished"] and bowing _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] head, he gave up _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] spirit.

###### v31
Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an important day), asked Pilate that their legs could be broken and they could be taken away.

###### v32
So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him.

###### v33
But _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came") which is understood as temporal] came to Jesus, after they saw he was already dead, they did not break his legs.

###### v34
But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water came out immediately.

###### v35
And the one who has seen _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] has testified, and his testimony is true, and that person knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.

###### v36
For these _things_ happened in order that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not a bone of his will be broken." ^[A quotation from [[Exod-12#v46|Exod 12:46]], [[Num-09#v12|Num 9:12]], and [[Ps-34#v20|Ps 34:20]]]

###### v37
And again another scripture says, "They will look on _the one_ whom they have pierced." ^[A quotation from [[Zech-12#v10|Zech 12:10]]]

###### v38
And after these _things_, Joseph _who was_ from Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but a secret one for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate allowed _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] so he came and took away his body.

###### v39
And Nicodemus--the one who had come to him formerly at night--also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes _weighing_ about a hundred pounds. ^[The Greek term refers to a Roman pound, 327.45 grams (approximately 12 ounces)]

###### v40
So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in _strips of_ linen cloth with the fragrant spices, as is the Jews' custom to prepare for burial.

###### v41
Now _there_ was a garden at the place where he was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one was yet buried.

###### v42
So there, on account of the day of preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was close by, they buried Jesus.
