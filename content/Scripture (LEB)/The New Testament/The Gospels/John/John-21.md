[[John-20|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
After these _things_ Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. Now he revealed _himself_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] in this way:

###### v2
Simon Peter and Thomas (who was called Didymus) ^[The Greek term means "the Twin"] and Nathanael from Cana in Galilee and the _sons_ of Zebedee and two others of his disciples were together.

###### v3
Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing!" They said to him, "We also are coming with you." They went out and got into the boat, and during that night they caught nothing.

###### v4
Now _when it_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was")] was already early morning, Jesus stood on the beach. However, the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.

###### v5
So Jesus said to them, "Children, you do not have any fish to eat, _do you_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_do you_"] They answered him, "No."

###### v6
And he said to them, "Throw the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find _some_." ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] So they threw _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and were no longer able to haul it in from the large number of the fish.

###### v7
Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" So Simon Peter, _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard that it was the Lord, tied around himself his outer garment (for he was naked) ^[I.e., "he was naked underneath the outer garment," which he tucked into his belt; alternatively, this could mean "for he was stripped for work"] and threw himself into the sea.

###### v8
But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net of fish, because they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits ^[Approximately 100 yards or 92 meters, based on a cubit of 18 inches.] away.

###### v9
So when they got out on the land, they saw a charcoal fire laid _there_, and a fish lying on _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and bread.

###### v10
Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught."

###### v11
So Simon Peter got into _the boat_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and hauled the net to the land, full of large fish--one hundred fifty-three--and _although there_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as concessive] were so many, the net was not torn.

###### v12
Jesus said to them, "Come, eat breakfast!" But none of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("knew") which is understood as causal] knew that it was the Lord.

###### v13
Jesus came and took the bread and gave _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to them, and the fish likewise.

###### v14
This _was_ now _the_ third _time_ Jesus was revealed to the disciples _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had been raised") which is understood as temporal] had been raised from the dead.

###### v15
Now when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon _son_ of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs!"

###### v16
He said to him again a second time, "Simon _son_ of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Shepherd my sheep!"

###### v17
He said to him a third _time_, "Simon _son_ of John, do you love me?" Peter was distressed because he said to him a third _time_, "Do you love me?" and he said to him, "Lord, you know everything! You know that I love you!" Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep!

###### v18
Truly, truly I say to you, when you were young, you tied _your clothes_ ^[The words "_your clothes_" are not in the Greek text but are implied] around yourself and walked wherever you wanted. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will tie you up and carry _you_ where you do not want _to go_. ^[*The words "_to go_" are not in the Greek text but are implied]

###### v19
(Now he said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God.) And _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had said") which is understood as temporal] had said this, he said to him, "Follow me!"

###### v20
Peter turned _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("turned") has been translated as a finite verb] saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] (who also leaned back on his chest at the dinner and said, "Lord, who is the one betraying you?")

###### v21
So _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw this one, Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, but what about this one?"

###### v22
Jesus said to him, "If I want him to remain until I come, what _is that_ ^[The words "_is that_" are not in the Greek text but are supplied in keeping with English style] to you? You follow me!"

###### v23
So this saying went out to the brothers that that disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but "If I want him to remain until I come, what _is that_ ^[The words "_is that_" are not in the Greek text but are supplied in keeping with English style] to you?"

###### v24
This is the disciple who is testifying about these _things_, and who has written down these _things_. And we know that his testimony is true.

###### v25
Now there are also many other _things_ that Jesus did, which--if they were written down one after the other--I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written.
