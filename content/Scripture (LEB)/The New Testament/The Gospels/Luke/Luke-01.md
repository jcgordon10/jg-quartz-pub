###### v1
Since many have attempted to compile an account concerning the events that have been fulfilled among us,

###### v2
just as those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning passed on to us,

###### v3
it seemed best to me also--_because I_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have followed") which is understood as causal] have followed all _things_ carefully from the beginning--to write _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] down in orderly sequence for you, most excellent Theophilus,

###### v4
so that you may know the certainty concerning the things about which you were taught.

###### v5
It happened that in the days of Herod, king of Judea, _there was_ a certain priest, Zechariah by name, of the division of Abijah. And _he had a wife_ ^[Literally "a wife to him"] from the daughters of Aaron, and her name _was_ Elizabeth.

###### v6
And they were both righteous in the sight of God, living blamelessly in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord.

###### v7
And _they did not have_ ^[Literally "there was not to them"] a child, because Elizabeth was barren. And they were both advanced _in years_. ^[Literally "in their days"]

###### v11
And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.

###### v12
And Zechariah was terrified _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw _the angel_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and fear fell upon him.

###### v13
But the angel said to him,
"Do not be afraid, Zechariah,
because your prayer has been heard,
and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son,
and you will call his name John.

###### v14
And _you will experience joy and exultation_, ^[Literally "joy and exultation will be to you"]
and many will rejoice at his birth.

###### v15
For he will be great in the sight of the Lord,
and he must never drink wine or beer,
and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit
_while he is_ ^[Here the phrase "while he is," including the verb, is understood in Greek and is supplied in the translation] still in his mother's womb.

###### v16

to the Lord their God.

###### v17
And he will go on before him
in the spirit and power of Elijah,
to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,
and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous,
to prepare for the Lord a people made ready."

###### v18
And Zechariah said to the angel, "By what will I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced _in years_!" ^[Literally "in her days"]

###### v20
And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day these _things_ take place, _because_ ^[Literally "in return for which"] you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time."

###### v22
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came out") which is understood as temporal] came out he was not able to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them, and remained unable to speak.

###### v23
And it happened that when the days of his service came to an end, he went away to his home.

###### v24
Now after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she kept herself in seclusion _for_ five months, saying,

###### v25

And the angel answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to her,
