###### v1
Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around him and hearing the word of God, he was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret, ^[Another name for the Sea of Galilee]

###### v2
and he saw two boats there beside the lake, but the fishermen had gotten out of them _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("had gotten out") has been translated as a finite verb] were washing their nets.

###### v3
And he got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("got") has been translated as a finite verb] asked him to put out from the land a little. And he sat down _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("sat down") has been translated as a finite verb] began to teach ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to teach")] the crowds from the boat.

###### v4
And when he stopped speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch."

###### v5
And Simon answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Master, _although we_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("worked hard") which is understood as concessive] worked hard through the whole night, we caught nothing. But at your word I will let down the nets."

###### v6
And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("did") which is understood as temporal] did this, they caught a very large number of fish, and their nets began to tear. ^[*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to tear")]

###### v7
And they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("come") has been translated as a finite verb] help them, and they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink.

###### v8
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] Simon Peter fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, Lord, because I am _a sinful man_!" ^[Literally "a man, a sinner"]

###### v9
For amazement had seized him and all those _who were_ with him at the catch of fish that they had caught,

###### v10
and so also _were_ James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were business partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid! From now on you will be catching people!"

###### v11
And _after they_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("brought") which is understood as temporal] brought _their_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] boats to the land, they left everything _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("left") has been translated as a finite verb] followed him.

###### v12
And it happened that while he was in one of the towns, _there was_ ^[Literally "behold"] a man _covered with leprosy_. ^[Literally "full of leprosy"] And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw Jesus, he fell down on _his_ face _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("fell down") has been translated as a finite verb] begged him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you are able to make me clean."

###### v13
And extending _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hand he touched him, saying, "I am willing; be clean." And immediately the leprosy went away from him.

###### v14
And he ordered him, "Tell no one, but go _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("go") has been translated as a finite verb] show yourself to the priest and bring _the offering_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] for your cleansing just as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.

###### v15
But the report about him spread even more, and large crowds were gathering to hear _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and to be healed of their illnesses.

###### v16
But he himself was withdrawing in the wilderness and praying.

###### v17
And it happened that on one of the days as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting _there_ who _had come_ ^[Literally "were having come"] from every village of Galilee and Judea and _from_ Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was _there_ in order _for_ him to heal.

###### v18
And behold, men _came_ carrying on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and place _him_ ^[Some manuscripts Some manuscripts include the pronoun "him" after "place"] ^[Since Greek routinely omits direct objects when they are clear from context, the pronoun is not necessary here in the Greek text, but it must be supplied in the English translation] before him.

###### v19
And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("find") which is understood as temporal] did not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went up") has been translated as a finite verb] let him down through the roof tiles with the stretcher into the midst _of them_, in front of Jesus.

###### v20
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven you."

###### v21
And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?"

###### v22
But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to them, "Why are you reasoning in your hearts?

###### v23
Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Get up and walk?'

###### v24
But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins," he said to the one who was paralyzed, "I say to you, 'Get up and pick up your stretcher _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("pick up") has been translated as a finite verb] go to your home.'"

###### v25
And immediately he stood up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participles ("stood up" and "picked up") have been translated as finite verbs] went away to his home, glorifying God.

###### v26
And amazement seized _them_ all, and they began to glorify ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to glorify")] God. And they were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen wonderful things today!"

###### v27
And after these _things_, he went out and saw a tax collector _named_ ^[Literally "by name"] Levi sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, "Follow me!"

###### v28
And leaving everything behind, he got up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("got up") has been translated as a finite verb] began to follow ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to follow")] him.

###### v32
I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance."

###### v33
And they said to him, "The disciples of John fast often and make prayers--likewise also the _disciples_ ^[The word "_disciples_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] of the Pharisees--but yours are eating and drinking!"

###### v34
So he ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] said ^[Some manuscripts have "So Jesus said"] to them, "You are not able to make the _bridegroom's attendants_ ^[Literally "sons of the bridal chamber"] fast as long as the bridegroom is with them, _are you_? ^[*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_are you_"]

###### v35
But days will come, and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days."

###### v36
And he also told a parable to them: "No one tears a patch from a new garment _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("tears") has been translated as a finite verb] puts _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] on an old garment. Otherwise, he will have torn the new also, and the old will not match the patch _that is_ from the new.

###### v37
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed.

And no one _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("drinking") which is understood as temporal] drinking old _wine_ ^[The word "_wine_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] wants new, because he says, 'The old is _just_ fine!'"
