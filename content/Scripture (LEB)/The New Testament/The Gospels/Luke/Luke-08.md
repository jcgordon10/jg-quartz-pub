###### v1
And it happened that _afterward_ ^[Literally "in what follows"] also he was going about from _one_ town and village _to another_ preaching and proclaiming the good news concerning the kingdom of God, and the twelve _were_ with him,

###### v2
and some women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (who was called Magdalene), from whom seven demons had gone out,

###### v3
and Joanna the wife of Chuza (Herod's household manager), and Susanna, and many others who were helping to support them from their possessions.

###### v4
And _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was gathering")] a large crowd was gathering and _they_ were going to him from town _after town_, he spoke by means of a parable:

###### v5
"The sower went out to sow his seed, and while he was sowing, _some seed_ ^[Literally "some of which"] fell on the side of the path and was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.

###### v6

###### v8
And other _seed_ fell on the good soil, and _when it_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came up") which is understood as temporal] came up, it produced a hundred times as much grain." _As he_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("said") which is understood as temporal] said these _things_, he called out, "The one who has ears to hear, let him hear!"

###### v9
And his disciples asked him what this parable meant.

###### v10
And he said, "To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest _they are_ in parables, so that
'Seeing they may not see,
and hearing they may not understand.' ^[A quotation from [[Isa-06#v9|Isa 6:9]]]

###### v11
Now the parable means this: the seed is the word of God,

###### v12
and those beside the path are the ones who have heard. Then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("believe") has been translated as a finite verb] be saved.

###### v13

###### v14
And the _seed_ that fell into the thorn plants--these are the ones who hear and _as they_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("go along") which is understood as temporal] go along are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life, and they do not bear fruit to maturity.

###### v15
But the _seed_ on the good soil--these are the ones who, _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("hearing") which is understood as temporal] hearing the word, hold fast to _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] with a noble and good heart, and bear fruit with patient endurance.
