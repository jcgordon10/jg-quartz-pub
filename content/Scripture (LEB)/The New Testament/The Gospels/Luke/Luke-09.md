###### v1
And summoning the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases,

###### v2
and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

###### v3
And he said to them, "Take along nothing for the journey--neither a staff, nor a traveler's bag, nor bread, nor money, nor to have two tunics apiece.

###### v4
And into whatever house you enter, stay there and depart from there.

###### v5
And _as for_ all those who do not welcome you--_when you_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("depart") which is understood as temporal] depart from that town, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them."

###### v6
So they departed _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("departed") has been translated as a finite verb] went throughout the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere.

###### v7
Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John has been raised from the dead,

###### v8
and by some that Elijah had appeared, and others that some prophet of ancient times had risen.

###### v9
And Herod said, "John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?" And he was wanting to see him.

###### v10
And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("returned") which is understood as temporal] returned, the apostles described to him all that they had done. And he took them along _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took … along") has been translated as a finite verb] withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida.

###### v11
But _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("found out") which is understood as temporal] the crowds found out, they followed him, and welcoming them, he began to speak ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to speak")] to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who had need of healing.

###### v12
Now the day began to be far spent, and the twelve came up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, "Send away the crowd so that they can go into the surrounding villages and farms to obtain lodging and find provisions, because we are here in a desolate place.

###### v13
But he said to them, "You give them _something_ to eat!" And they said, "_We have no_ ^[Literally "there is not to us"] more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("go") has been translated as a finite verb] purchase food for all these people."

###### v14
(For there were about five thousand men.) So he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."

###### v15
And they did so, and had _them_ all sit down.

###### v16
And taking the five loaves and the two fish, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied before the participle ("looking up") in keeping with English style] looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them and began giving ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began giving")] _them_ ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to speak")] to the disciples to set before the crowd.

###### v17
And _they_ all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over was picked up by them--twelve baskets of broken pieces.

###### v18
And it happened that while he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, saying, "Who do the crowds say _that_ I am?"

###### v19
And they answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "John the Baptist, but others, Elijah, and others, that one of the ancient prophets has risen."

###### v20
And he said to them, "But who do you say _that_ I am?" And Peter answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "The Christ of God."

###### v21
But he warned _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("warned") has been translated as a finite verb] commanded them to tell this to no one,

###### v22
saying, "It is necessary _for_ the Son of Man to suffer many _things_ and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day.

###### v23
And he said to _them_ all, "If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross every day and follow me.

###### v24
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me, this person will save it.

###### v25
For what is a person benefited _if he_ ^[Here "_if_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("gains") which is understood as conditional] gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?

###### v26
For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of this person when he comes in his glory and the _glory_ ^[Here "_glory_" is an understood repetition of the same word earlier in this verse] of the Father and of the holy angels.

###### v27
But I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God."

###### v28
Now it happened that about eight days after these words, he took along Peter and John and James _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took along") has been translated as a finite verb] went up on the mountain to pray.

###### v29
And as he was praying, the appearance of his face became different, and his clothing _became_ white, gleaming like lightning. ^[Or "became brilliant as light"; or "became dazzling white"]

###### v30
And behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,

###### v31
who appeared in glory _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("appeared") has been translated as a finite verb] were speaking _about_ his departure which he was about to fulfill ^[Or "to accomplish"] in Jerusalem.

###### v32
Now Peter and those with him were _very sleepy_, ^[Literally "burdened with sleep"] but _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("became fully awake") which is understood as temporal] became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.

###### v33
And it happened that as they were going away from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good _for_ us to be here. And let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah," not knowing what he was saying.

###### v34
And _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("saying")] he was saying these _things_, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.

###### v35
And a voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, _my_ Chosen One. Listen to him!"

###### v36
And after the voice had occurred, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.

###### v37
Now it happened that on the next day, _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("had come down")] they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.

###### v38
And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look with concern on my son, because he is my only _son_!

###### v39
And behold, a spirit seizes him and suddenly he screams, and it convulses him with foam and rarely withdraws from him, battering him severely.

###### v40
And I begged your disciples that they would expel it, and they were not able _to do so_."

###### v41
So Jesus answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "O unbelieving and perverted generation! _How long_ ^[Literally "until when"] will I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!"

###### v42
And _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("approaching")] he was still approaching, the demon threw him down and convulsed _him_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.

###### v43
And they were all astounded at the impressiveness of God.
But _while they_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("marveling")] were all marveling at all _the things_ that he was doing, he said to his disciples,

###### v44
"_You take these words to heart_, ^[Literally "you put these words into your ears"] for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men."

###### v45
But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they could not understand it. And they were afraid to ask him about this statement.

###### v46
And an argument developed among them as to who of them might be greatest.

###### v47
But Jesus, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("knew") which is understood as causal] knew the thoughts of their hearts, took hold of a child and had him stand beside him

###### v48
and said to them, "Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For the one who is least among you all--this one is great."

###### v49
And John answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Master, we saw someone expelling demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow in company with us."

###### v50
But Jesus said to him, "Do not prevent _him_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] because whoever is not against you is for you."

###### v51
Now it happened that when the days were approaching _for him to be taken up_, ^[Literally "of his taking up"] he set _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] face to go to Jerusalem.

###### v52
And he sent messengers before _him_, ^[Literally "his face"] and they went _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went") has been translated as a finite verb] entered into a village of the Samaritans in order to prepare for him.

###### v53
And they did not welcome him because _he was determined to go_ ^[Literally "his face was going"] to Jerusalem.

###### v54
Now _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] the disciples James and John saw _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] they said, "Lord, do you want us to call fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"

###### v55
But he turned around _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("turned around") has been translated as a finite verb] rebuked them,

###### v56
and they proceeded to another village.

###### v57
And _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were going")] they were traveling on the road, someone said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go!"

###### v58
And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have dens and birds of the sky _have_ nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] head."

###### v59
And he said to another, "Follow me!" But he said, "Lord, first allow me to go _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("go") has been translated as an infinitive] bury my father."

###### v60
But he said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead! But you go _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("go") has been translated as a finite verb] proclaim the kingdom of God."

###### v61
And another _person_ also said, "I will follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say farewell to those in my house."

###### v62
But Jesus said, ^[Some manuscripts have "said to him"] "No one who puts _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hand on the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God!"
