###### v1
And it happened that while he was in a certain place praying, when he stopped a certain one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples."

###### v2
And he said to them, "When you pray, say,
"Father,
may your name be treated as holy.
May your kingdom come.

###### v3
Give us each day our daily bread.

###### v4
And forgive us our sins,
for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.
And do not lead us into temptation."

###### v5
And he said to them, "Who of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves,

###### v6
because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I do not have anything to set before him.'

###### v7
And that one will answer from inside _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("will answer") has been translated as a finite verb] say, 'Do not cause me trouble! The door has already been shut and my children are with me in bed! I am not able to get up to give you _anything_.' ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v8
I tell you, even if he does not give him _anything_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("gets up") which is understood as temporal] gets up because _he_ is his friend, at any rate because of his impudence ^[Or "shamelessness"; some translate as "persistence" based on the context, though this is not the normal meaning of the word] he will get up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("will get up") has been translated as a finite verb] give him whatever he needs.

###### v9
And I tell you, ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened for you.

###### v10
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.

###### v11
But what father from among you, _if his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] son will ask for a fish, instead of a fish will give him a snake?

###### v12
Or also, _if_ he will ask for an egg, will give him a scorpion?

###### v13
Therefore if you, _although you_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as concessive] are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"

###### v14
And he was expelling a mute demon. ^[Some manuscripts have "a demon, and it was mute"] Now it happened that _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("came out")] the demon came out, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowds were astonished.

###### v15
But some of them said, "By Beelzebul the ruler of demons he expels demons!"

###### v16
And others, _in order to_ ^[Here "_in order to_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("test") which is understood as purpose] test _him_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] were demanding from him a sign from heaven.

###### v17
But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and _a divided household_ ^[Literally "house against house"] falls.

###### v18
So if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say _that_ I expel demons by Beelzebul.

###### v19
But if I expel demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons expel _them_? ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] For this _reason_ they will be your judges!

###### v20
But if I expel demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you!

###### v21
When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his possessions are _safe_. ^[Literally "in peace"]

###### v22
But when a stronger man attacks him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("attacks") has been translated as a finite verb] conquers him, he takes away his full armor in which he trusted and distributes his plunder.

###### v23
The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters.

###### v24
"Whenever an unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it travels through waterless places searching for rest, and does not find _it_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] It says, ^[Some manuscripts have "Then it says"] 'I will return to my house from which I came out.'

###### v25
And _when it_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("arrives") which is understood as temporal] arrives it finds _the house_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] swept and put in order.

###### v26
Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and _they_ go in _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("go in") has been translated as a finite verb] live there. And the last _state_ of that person becomes worse than the first!"

###### v27
Now it happened that as he said these _things_, a certain woman from the crowd raised _her_ voice _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("raised") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, "Blessed _is_ the womb that bore you, and _the_ breasts _at_ which you nursed!"

###### v28
But he said, "On the contrary, blessed _are_ those who hear the word of God and follow _it_!" ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v29
And _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were increasing")] the crowds were increasing, he began to say, "This generation is an evil generation! It demands a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah!

###### v30
For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.

###### v31
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, _something_ ^[Here "something" is supplied in the translation because the adjective is neuter gender] greater than Solomon _is_ here!

###### v32
The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah, and behold, _something_ ^[Here "something" is supplied in the translation because the adjective is neuter gender] greater than Jonah _is_ here!

###### v33
"No one _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("lighting") which is understood as temporal] lighting a lamp puts _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] in a cellar or under a bushel basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who come in can see the light.

###### v34
Your eye is the lamp of the body. When your eye is sincere, your whole body is full of light also. But when it is evil, your body _is_ dark also.

###### v35
Therefore pay careful attention _that_ the light in you is not darkness!

###### v36
If therefore your whole body _is_ full of light, not having any part dark, it will be completely full of light, as when the lamp with _its_ light gives light to you."

###### v37
And as he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him _to have a meal_ ^[Literally "that he would have a meal"] with him, and he went in _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went in") has been translated as a finite verb] reclined at table.

###### v38
And the Pharisee, _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] was astonished that he did not first wash before the meal.

###### v39
But the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but your inside is full of greediness and wickedness.

###### v40
Fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?

###### v41
But give _as_ charitable giving the things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you.

###### v42
"But woe to you, Pharisees, because you pay a tenth of mint and rue and every garden herb, and neglect justice and love for God! But it was necessary to do these _things_ without neglecting those things also.

###### v43
Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the best seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces!

###### v44
Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, and the people who walk over _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] do not know _it_! ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v45
And one of the legal experts answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, "Teacher, _when you_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("say") which is understood as temporal] say these _things_, you insult us also!"

###### v46
So he said, "Woe to you also, legal experts, because you load people _with_ burdens hard to bear, and _you_ yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers!

###### v47
Woe to you, because you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them!

###### v48
As a result you are witnesses, and you approve of the deeds of your fathers, because they killed them and you build _their tombs_! ^[A large number of later manuscripts add the words "their tombs" here, with variations of wording; although the words are not likely to be original, it is necessary to supply them in keeping with English style]

###### v49
For this _reason_ also the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles, and _some_ of them they will kill and persecute,'

###### v50
so that the blood of all the prophets that has been shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,

###### v51
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the temple building. ^[Literally "the house," here a reference to the temple] Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation!

###### v52
Woe to you, legal experts, because you have taken away the key to knowledge! You did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering!"

###### v53
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("departed")] he departed from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly hostile, and to question him closely about many _things_,

###### v54
plotting to catch him with reference to something _he might say_. ^[Literally "from his mouth"]
