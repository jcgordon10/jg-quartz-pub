During _this time_ ^[Literally "which time"] _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("had gathered together")] a crowd of many thousands had gathered together, so that they were trampling one another, he began to say to his disciples first, "Beware for yourselves of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

###### v2
But nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, and secret that will not be made known.

###### v3

###### v4
"And I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after these _things_ do not have anything more to do.

###### v5
But I will show you whom you should fear: fear the one who has authority, after the killing, to throw _you_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] into hell! Yes, I tell you, fear this one!

###### v6
Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.

###### v7
But even the hairs of your head are all numbered! Do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.

###### v8
"And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before people, the Son of Man also will acknowledge him before the angels of God,

###### v9
but the one who denies me before people will be denied before the angels of God.

###### v10
And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but to the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.

###### v11
But when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious how or what you should speak in your own defense or what you should say,

###### v12

###### v15
And he said to them, "Watch out and guard yourselves from all greediness, because not _even_ when someone has an abundance _does_ ^[Literally "is"] his life _consist_ of his possessions."

###### v16
And he told a parable to them, saying, "The land of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest.

###### v17
And he reasoned to himself, saying, 'What should I do? For I do not have anywhere I can gather in my crops.'

###### v18
And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and I will gather in there all my grain and possessions.

###### v19
And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have many possessions stored up for many years. Relax, eat, drink, celebrate!"'

###### v20
But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your life ^[The same Greek word can be translated "soul" or "life" depending on the context] is demanded from you, and _the things_ which you have prepared--whose will they be?'

###### v21
So _is_ the one who stores up treasure for himself, and who is not rich toward God!"

###### v22
And he said to his disciples, "For this _reason_ I tell you, do not be anxious for _your_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] life, what you will eat, or for _your_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] body, what you will wear.

###### v23
For life is more than food, and the body _more than_ clothing.

###### v24

And which of you _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("being anxious") which is understood as means] being anxious is able to add an hour ^[Or "a cubit" (the literal meaning); most scholars understand this to refer figuratively to an "hour" of life here, though some take it as a literal measurement of height] to his life span?

###### v26
If then you are not even able _to do_ a very little thing, why are you anxious about the rest?

###### v27
Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not toil or spin, but I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these.

###### v28
But if God clothes the grass in the field in this way, _although it_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is") which is understood as concessive] is _here_ today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more _will he do so for_ ^[The phrase "_will he do so for_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] you, you of little faith?

###### v29
And you, do not consider what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not be anxious.

###### v30
For all the nations of the world seek after these _things_, and your Father knows that you need these _things_.

###### v32

For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

###### v35
"_You must be prepared for action_ ^[Literally "your loins must be girded"] and _your_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] lamps burning.

###### v40
You also must be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think _he will come_." ^[*The words "_he will come_" are not in the Greek text but are implied]

###### v41

###### v47
And that slave who knew the will of his master and did not prepare or do according to his will _will be given a severe beating_. ^[Literally "will be beaten much"]

###### v48
But the one who did not know and did _things_ deserving blows _will be given a light beating_. ^[Literally "will be beaten a few times"] And from everyone to whom much has been given, much will be demanded, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will ask him _for_ even more.

###### v49

###### v50

Do you think that I have come to grant peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division!

###### v52
