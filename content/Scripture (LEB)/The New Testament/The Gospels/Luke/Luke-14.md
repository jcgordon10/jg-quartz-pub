###### v1
And it happened that when he came to the house of a certain one of the leaders of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat _a meal_, ^[Literally "bread"] they were watching him closely.

###### v2
And behold, a certain man was in front of him, suffering from edema.

###### v3
And Jesus answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to the legal experts and Pharisees, saying, "Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath, or not?"

###### v4
But they remained silent. And he took hold of _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took hold of") has been translated as a finite verb] healed him, and sent _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] away.

###### v5
And he said to them, "Who among you, _if your_ ^[The words "_if your_" are not in the Greek text but are implied] son or _your_ ox falls into a well ^[Or "cistern"] on the day of the Sabbath, will not immediately pull him out?"

###### v6
And they were not able to make a reply to these _things_.

###### v7
Now he told a parable to those who had been invited _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("noticed") which is understood as temporal] noticed how they were choosing for themselves the places of honor, saying to them,

###### v8
"When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, ^[Or perhaps simply "a feast"] do not recline at the table in the place of honor, lest _someone_ more distinguished than you has been invited by him,

###### v9
and the one who invited you _both_ ^[Literally "and him"] will come _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("will come") has been translated as a finite verb] say to you, 'Give the place to this person,' and then with shame you will begin to take the last place.

###### v10
But when you are invited, go _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("go") has been translated as a finite verb] recline at the table in the last place, so that when the one who invited you comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then it will be an honor to you in the presence of all those who are reclining at the table with you.

###### v11
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted."

###### v12
And he also said to the one who had invited him, "When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or wealthy neighbors, lest they also invite you _in return_, and repayment come to you.

###### v13
But whenever you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,

###### v14
and you will be blessed, because they are not able to repay you. For it will be paid back to you at the resurrection of the righteous."

###### v15
Now _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] one of those reclining at the table with _him_ heard these _things_, he said to him, "Blessed _is_ _everyone who_ ^[Literally "whoever"] will eat bread in the kingdom of God!"

###### v16
But he said to him, "A certain man was giving a large banquet and invited many.

###### v17
And he sent his slave at the hour of the banquet to say to those who have been invited, 'Come, because now it is ready!'

###### v18
And they all _alike_ ^[Literally "by one"] began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, 'I have purchased a field, and _I must_ ^[Literally "I have necessity"] go out to look at it. I ask you, consider me excused.'

###### v19
And another said, 'I have purchased five yoke of oxen, and I am going to examine them. I ask you, consider me excused.'

###### v20
And another said, 'I have married a wife, and for this _reason_ I am not able to come.'

###### v21
And the slave came _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came") has been translated as a finite verb] reported these _things_ to his master. Then the master of the house became angry _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("became angry") has been translated as a finite verb] said to his slave, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame!'

###### v22
And the slave said, 'Sir, what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.'

###### v23
And the master said to the slave, 'Go out into the highways and hedges and press _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to come in, so that my house will be filled!

###### v24
For I say to you that none of those persons who were invited will taste my banquet!'"

###### v25
Now large crowds were going along with him, and he turned around _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("turned around") has been translated as a finite verb] said to them,

###### v26
"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and furthermore, even his own life, _he cannot be_ ^[Literally "he is not able to be"] my disciple.

###### v27
Whoever does not carry his own cross and _follow_ ^[Literally "come after"] me _cannot be_ ^[Literally "is not able to be"] my disciple.

###### v28
For which of you, wanting to build a tower, does not first sit down _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("sit down") has been translated as a finite verb] calculate the cost _to see_ if he has _enough_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] _to complete it_? ^[Literally "for completion"]

###### v29
_Otherwise_ ^[Literally "so that lest"] _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("has laid")] he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] all who see _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] will begin to ridicule him,

###### v30
saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish!'

###### v31
Or what king, going out to engage another king in battle, does not sit down first _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("sit down") has been translated as a finite verb] deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand.

###### v32
But if not, _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("is")] _the other_ is still far away, he sends an ambassador _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("asks") has been translated as a finite verb] asks _for terms of_ ^[Literally "the things with reference to"] peace.

###### v33
In the _same_ way, therefore, every _one_ of you who does not renounce all his own possessions _cannot be_ ^[Literally "is not able to be"] my disciple.

###### v34
"Now salt _is_ good, but if salt becomes tasteless, with what will it be made salty?
