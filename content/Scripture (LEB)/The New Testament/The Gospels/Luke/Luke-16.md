###### v1
And he also said to the disciples, "A certain man was rich, who had a manager. And charges were brought to him that this person was squandering his possessions.

###### v2
And he summoned him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("summoned") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give the account of your management, because you can no longer manage.'

###### v3
And the manager said to himself, 'What should I do, because my master is taking away the management from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg.

###### v4
I know what I should do, so that when I am removed from the management they will welcome me into their homes!'

###### v5
And he summoned each one of his own master's debtors _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("summoned") has been translated as a finite verb] said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'

###### v6
And he said, 'A hundred measures of olive oil.' So he said to him, 'Take your promissory note and sit down quickly _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("sit down") has been translated as a finite verb] write fifty.'

###### v7
Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' And he said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your promissory note and write eighty.'

###### v8
And the master praised the dishonest manager, because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are shrewder than the sons of light with regard to their own generation. ^[Or "kind"]

###### v9
And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it runs out they will welcome you into the eternal dwellings.

###### v10
"The one who _is_ faithful in very little is also faithful in much, and the one who _is_ dishonest in very little is also dishonest in much.

###### v11
If then you have not been faithful with unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true _riches_? ^[*The word "_riches_" is not in the Greek text but is implied]

###### v12
And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you your own?

###### v13
No domestic slave is able to serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and will despise the other. You are not able to serve God and money."

###### v14
Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these _things_, and they ridiculed him.

###### v15
And he said to them, "You are the ones who justify themselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts! For _what is_ _considered_ exalted among men _is_ an abomination in the sight of God.

###### v16
"The law and the prophets _were_ until John; from that time _on_ the kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone is urgently pressed ^[The verb is translated here as a passive; some English versions translate the verb as active ("forces _their way_ into it")] into it.

###### v17
But it is easier _for_ heaven and earth to pass away than _for_ one stroke of a letter of the law to become invalid.

###### v18
"Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and the one who marries a woman divorced from _her_ husband commits adultery.

###### v19
"Now a certain man was rich, and dressed _in_ purple cloth and fine linen, feasting sumptuously every day.

###### v20
And a certain poor man _named_ ^[Literally "by name"] Lazarus, covered with sores, lay at his gate,

###### v21
and was longing to be filled with what fell from the table of the rich man. But even the dogs came _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came") has been translated as a finite verb] licked his sores.

###### v22
Now it happened that the poor man died, and he was carried away by the angels to _Abraham's side_. ^[Literally "the bosom of Abraham"] And the rich man also died and was buried.

###### v23
And in Hades he lifted up his eyes _as he_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as temporal] was in torment _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("lifted up") has been translated as a finite verb] saw Abraham from a distance, and Lazarus _at his side_. ^[Literally "in his bosom"]

###### v24
And he called out _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("called out") has been translated as a finite verb] said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he could dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am suffering pain in this flame!'

###### v25
But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you received your good _things_ during your life, and Lazarus likewise bad _things_. But now he is comforted here, but you are suffering pain.

###### v26
And in _addition to_ all these _things_, a great chasm has been established between us and you, so that those who want to cross over from here to you are not able _to do so_, ^[*The words "to do so" are not in the Greek text but are implied] nor can they cross over from there to us.'

###### v27
So he said, 'Then I ask you, father, that you send him to my father's house,

###### v28
for I have five brothers, so that he could warn them, in order that they also should not come to this place of torment!'

###### v29
But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the prophets; they must listen to them.'

###### v30
And he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent!'

###### v31
But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone rises from the dead.'"
