###### v1
And he told them a parable to _show that_ they must always pray and not be discouraged,

###### v2
saying, "There was a certain judge in a certain town who did not fear God and did not respect people.

###### v3
And there was a widow in that town, and she kept coming to him, saying, 'Grant me justice against my adversary!'

###### v4
And he was not willing for a time, but after these _things_ he said to himself, 'Even if I do not fear God or respect people,

###### v5
yet because this widow is causing trouble for me, I will grant her justice, so that she does not wear me down in the end _by her_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("coming back") which is understood as means] coming back!'"

###### v6
And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge is saying!

###### v7
And will not God surely _see to it that justice is done_ ^[Literally "carry out the giving of justice"] to his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night, and will he delay toward them?

###### v8
I tell you that _he will see to it that justice is done_ ^[Literally "he will carry out the giving of justice"] for them soon! Nevertheless, _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("comes") which is understood as temporal] the Son of Man comes, then will he find faith on earth?"

###### v9
And he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and looked down on _everyone else_: ^[Literally "the rest"]

###### v10
"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.

###### v11
The Pharisee stood _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("stood") has been translated as a finite verb] prayed these _things_ with reference to himself: 'God, I give thanks to you that I am not like other people--swindlers, unrighteous _people_, adulterers, or even like this tax collector!

###### v12
I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get.'

###### v13
But the tax collector, standing far away, did not want even to raise his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'

###### v14
I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than that one! For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."

###### v15
Now they were bringing even _their_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] babies to him so that he could touch them. But _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] the disciples saw _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] they rebuked them.

###### v16
But Jesus called them to himself, saying, "Allow the children to come to me, and do not forbid them, _for to such belongs_ ^[Literally "for of such is"] the kingdom of God.

###### v17
Truly I say to you, whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it."

###### v18
And a certain ruler asked him, saying, "Good Teacher, _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("doing") which is understood as means] doing what will I inherit eternal life?"

###### v19
And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one _is_ good except God alone.

###### v20
You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.'" ^[A quotation from [[Exod-20#v12|Exod 20:12–16]][[Exod-20#v13|]][[Exod-20#v14|]][[Exod-20#v15|]][[Exod-20#v16|]]; [[Deut-05#v16|Deut 5:16–20]][[Deut-05#v17|]][[Deut-05#v18|]][[Deut-05#v19|]][[Deut-05#v20|]]]

###### v21
And he said, "All these I have observed from my ^[Some manuscripts omit "my"] youth."

###### v22
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard _this_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] Jesus said to him, "_You still lack one thing_: ^[Literally "one still lacking to you"] Sell all that you have, and distribute _the proceeds_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to the poor--and you will have treasure in heaven--and come, follow me."

###### v23
But _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard these _things_ he became very sad, because he was extremely wealthy.

###### v24
And Jesus took notice of him ^[Some manuscripts add "becoming very sad"] _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took notice of") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "How _difficult it is for_ ^[Literally "with difficulty"] those who possess wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!

###### v25
For it is easier _for_ a camel to go through the eye of a needle than _for_ a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God.

###### v26
So those who heard _this_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] said, "And who can be saved?"

###### v27
But he said, "_What is_ impossible with men is possible with God."

###### v28
And Peter said, "Behold, we have left _all that is ours_ ^[Literally "our own"] _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("have left") has been translated as a finite verb] followed you."

###### v29
And he said to them, "Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children on account of the kingdom of God,

###### v30
who will not receive many times more in this time and in the age to come, eternal life."

###### v31

For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and mistreated and spit on,

###### v33
and _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("flogging") which is understood as temporal] flogging _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise."

And they understood none of these _things_, and this saying was concealed from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said.

###### v35
Now it happened that as he drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting on the side of the road begging.

###### v36
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant.

###### v37
And they told him, "Jesus the Nazarene is passing by."

###### v38
And he called out, saying, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"

###### v39
And those who were in front rebuked him, that he should be silent, but he cried out _even more loudly_, ^[Literally "by much more"] "Son of David, have mercy on me!"

###### v40
So Jesus stopped _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("stopped") has been translated as a finite verb] ordered him to be brought to him.

###### v41
"What do you want me to do for you?" And he said, "Lord, that I may regain _my_ sight.
