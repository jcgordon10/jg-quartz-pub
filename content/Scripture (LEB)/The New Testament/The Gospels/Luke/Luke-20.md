###### v1
And it happened that on one of the days _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was teaching")] he was teaching the people in the temple _courts_ ^[Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes approached together with the elders

###### v2
and said, saying to him, "Tell us, by what authority you are doing these _things_, or who is the one who gave you this authority?

###### v3
And he answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to them, "I also will ask you a question, and you tell me:

###### v4
The baptism of John--was _it_ from heaven or from men?

###### v5
And they discussed _this_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] with one another, saying, "If we say 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe him?'

###### v6
But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us to death, because they are convinced _that_ John was a prophet."

###### v7
And they replied _that they_ did not know where _it was_ from.

###### v8
And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these _things_."

###### v9
And he began to tell the people this parable: "A man ^[Some manuscripts have "A certain man"] planted a vineyard, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey for a long time.

###### v10
And at the proper time he sent a slave to the tenant farmers, so that they would give him _some_ of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenant farmers sent him away empty-handed _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("beating") which is understood as temporal] beating _him_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v11
And he proceeded to send another slave, but they beat and dishonored that one also, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the two previous participles ("beat" and "dishonored") have been translated as finite verbs] sent _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] away empty-handed.

###### v12
And he proceeded to send a third, but they wounded _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("wounded") has been translated as a finite verb] threw out this one also.

###### v13
So the owner of the vineyard said, 'What should I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.'

###### v14
But _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] the tenant farmers saw him, they began to reason ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to reason")] with one another, saying, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance will become ours!'

###### v15
And they threw him out of the vineyard _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("threw") has been translated as a finite verb] killed _him_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

###### v16
He will come and destroy those tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others." And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard _this_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] they said, "_May this_ never happen!"

###### v17
But he looked intently at them _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("looked intently at") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "What then is this that is written:
'The stone which the builders rejected,
this has become _the cornerstone_.' ^[Literally "the head of the corner"]

###### v18
Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and _the one_ on whom it falls--it will crush him!"

###### v19
And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay _their_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hands on him at _that_ same hour, and they were afraid of the people, for they knew that he had told this parable with reference to them.

###### v20
And they watched _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] closely _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("watched closely") has been translated as a finite verb] sent spies who pretended they were upright, in order that they could catch him in a statement, so that they could hand him over to the authority and the jurisdiction of the governor.

###### v21
And they asked him, saying, "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and do not _show partiality_, ^[Literally "receive face"] but teach the way of God in truth.

###### v22
Is it permitted _for_ us to pay taxes ^[Or "the tribute tax"] to Caesar or not?"

###### v23
But seeing through their craftiness, he said to them,

###### v24
"Show me a denarius! Whose image and inscription does it have?" And they answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, ^[Some manuscripts have "And they said"] "Caesar's."

###### v25
So he said to them, "Well then, give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!"

###### v26
And they were not able to catch _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] ^[Some manuscripts explicitly state "him"] in a statement in the sight of the people, and astonished at his answer, they became silent.

###### v27
Now some of the Sadducees--who deny _that there is a resurrection_ ^[Literally "resurrection not to exist"]--came up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] asked him,

###### v28
saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us if someone's brother dies having a wife, and this man is childless, that his brother should take the wife and _father_ ^[Literally "raise up"] descendants for his brother.

###### v29
Now there were seven brothers, and the first took a wife _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took") has been translated as a finite verb] died childless,

###### v30
and the second,

###### v31
and the third took her, and likewise also the seven did not leave children and died.

###### v32
Finally the woman also died.

###### v33
Therefore in the resurrection, the woman--whose wife will she be? For the seven had her _as_ wife."

###### v34
And Jesus said to them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,

###### v35
but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and _to_ the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,

###### v36
for they are not even able to die any longer, because they are like the angels and are sons of God, _because they_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as causal] are sons of the resurrection.

###### v37
But that the dead are raised, even Moses revealed in _the passage about_ ^[The words "_the passage about_" are not in the Greek text but are implied; here a common form of rabbinic citation is being used to refer to an Old Testament passage] the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and _the_ God of Isaac and _the_ God of Jacob.

###### v38
Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him!"

###### v39
And some of the scribes answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Teacher, you have spoken well."

###### v40
For they no longer dared to ask him anything.

###### v41
But he said to them, "In what sense do they say _that_ the Christ is David's son?

###### v42
For David himself says in the book of Psalms,
'The Lord said to my Lord,
"Sit at my right hand,

###### v43
until I make your enemies
a footstool for your feet."' ^[A quotation from [[Ps-110#v1|Ps 110:1]]]

###### v44
David therefore calls him 'Lord,' and how is he his son?"

###### v45
And _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were listening")] all the people were listening, he said to the disciples, ^[Some manuscripts have "to his disciples"]

###### v46
"Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets,

###### v47
who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy _prayers_ for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!"
