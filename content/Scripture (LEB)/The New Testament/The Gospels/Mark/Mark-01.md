Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah,
"Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face,
who will prepare your way,

the voice of one shouting in the wilderness,
'Prepare the way of the Lord,
make straight his paths!'" ^[A quotation from [[Isa-40#v3|Isa 40:3]]]

###### v4
John was there baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming ^[Some manuscripts have "and proclaiming"] a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

###### v5
And all the Judean region and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.

###### v6
And John was dressed in camel's hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.

###### v7
And he was preaching, saying, "One _who is_ more powerful than I is coming after me, of whom I am not worthy to bend down _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("bend down") has been translated as an infinitive] untie the strap of his sandals.

###### v8
I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."

###### v9
And it happened that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.

###### v10
And immediately _as he_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was coming up") which is understood as temporal] was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being split apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him.

###### v11
And a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."

###### v12
And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.

###### v13
And he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.

###### v14
And after ^[Some manuscripts have "Now after"] John _had been taken into custody_, ^[Literally "had been handed over"] Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God

###### v15
and saying, "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the gospel!"

###### v16
And _as he_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was passing by") which is understood as temporal] was passing by along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon's brother, casting _a net_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] into the sea (for they were fishermen).

###### v17
And Jesus said to them, "_Follow_ ^[Literally "come after"] me and I will make you become fishers of people."

###### v18
And immediately they left their nets _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("left") has been translated as a finite verb] followed him.

###### v19
And going on a little _farther_, he saw James the _son_ of Zebedee and his brother John, and they _were_ in the boat mending the nets.

###### v20
And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("left") has been translated as a finite verb] went away after him.

###### v21
And they went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue. ^[Some manuscripts have "he went into the synagogue and began to teach"]

###### v22
And they were amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like the scribes.

###### v23
And so then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,

###### v24
saying, "_Leave us alone_, ^[Literally "what to us and to you"] Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"

###### v25
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"

###### v26
And _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("convulsing") which is understood as temporal] convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, the unclean spirit came out of him.

###### v27
And they were all amazed, so that _they began_ to discuss with one another, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him."

###### v28
And the report about him then went out everywhere in the whole surrounding region of Galilee.

###### v29
And so then he departed from the synagogue _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("departed") has been translated as a finite verb] came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.

###### v30
Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying down, suffering with a fever, and at once they told him about her.

###### v32
Now _when it_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was")] was evening, when the sun had set, they began bringing ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began bringing")] to him all those _who were sick_ ^[Literally "who were having badly"] and those who were demon-possessed.

###### v33
And the whole town was gathered together at the door.

###### v34
And he healed many _who were sick_ ^[Literally "who were having badly"] with various diseases and expelled many demons. And he did not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.

###### v35
And getting up early in the morning _while it was_ very dark, he departed and went to a deserted place, and there he was praying.

###### v36
And Simon and those _who were_ with him searched diligently for him.

###### v37
And they found him and said to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"

###### v38
And he said to them, "Let us go elsewhere, into the neighboring rural towns, so that I can preach there also, because I have come out for this _very_ reason."

###### v39
And he went into all Galilee preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons.

###### v40
And a leper came to him, entreating him and kneeling down, saying ^[Some manuscripts have "and saying"] to him, "If you are willing, you are able to make me clean."

###### v41
And becoming angry, ^[Some manuscripts have "having compassion"] he stretched out his hand _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("stretched out") has been translated as a finite verb] touched _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation], and said to him, "I am willing; be made clean."

And warning him sternly, he sent him away at once.

###### v44
And he said to him, "See to it that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and bring for your cleansing _the things_ which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.

###### v45
But he went out _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went out") has been translated as a finite verb] began to proclaim _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] freely and to spread abroad the account, so that he was no longer able to enter publicly into a town. But he was staying outside in deserted places, and they were coming to him from all directions.
