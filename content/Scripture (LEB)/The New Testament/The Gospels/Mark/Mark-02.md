###### v1
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("entered") which is understood as temporal] entered again into Capernaum after _some_ days, it became known that he was at home.

###### v2
And many had gathered, so that _there was_ no longer room, not even at the door, and he was speaking the word to them.

###### v3
And they came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four _of them_.

###### v4
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("able") which is understood as temporal] they were not able to bring _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. And _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("digging through") which is understood as temporal] digging through, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying.

###### v5
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Child, your sins are forgiven."

###### v6
Now some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,

###### v7
"Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?"

###### v8
And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves, said to them, "Why are you considering these _things_ in your hearts?

###### v9
Which is easier to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say 'Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk'?

###### v10
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,"--he said to the paralytic--

###### v11
"I say to you, get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home."

###### v12
And he got up and immediately picked up his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] stretcher _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("picked up") has been translated as a finite verb] went out in front of _them_ all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We have never seen _anything_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] like this!"

###### v13
And he went out again beside the sea, ^[That is, the Sea of Galilee] and all the crowd was coming to him, and he began to teach ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to teach")] them.

###### v14
And _as he_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was passing by") which is understood as temporal] was passing by, he saw Levi the _son_ of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, "Follow me!" And he stood up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("stood up") has been translated as a finite verb] followed him.

###### v15
And it happened that he _was dining_ ^[Literally "was reclining for a meal"] in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners _were dining with_ ^[Literally "were reclining at table with"] Jesus and his disciples, for there were many and they were following him.

###### v16
And the scribes of the Pharisees, _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, began to say ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"

###### v17
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] Jesus heard _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation], he said to them, "Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those _who are sick_. ^[Literally "having badly"] I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."

###### v18
And John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to him, "_Why_ ^[Literally "for what" _reason_] do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"

###### v19
And Jesus said to them, "The _bridegroom's attendants_ ^[Literally "the sons of the bridal chamber"] are not able to fast while the bridegroom is with them, _are they_? ^[The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_are they_"] As long a time _as_ they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast.

###### v20
But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.

###### v21
No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. _Otherwise_ ^[Literally "but if not"] the patch pulls away from it--the new from the old--and the tear becomes worse.

###### v22
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. _Otherwise_ ^[Literally "but if not"] the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine is destroyed and the wineskins _too_. But new wine _is put_ into new wineskins."

###### v23
And it happened that he was going through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to make _their_ way _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("picking") which is understood as temporal] plucking off the heads of grain.

###### v24
And the Pharisees began to say ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to say")] to him, "Behold, why are they doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath?"

###### v25
And he said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he had need and he and those _who were_ with him were hungry--

###### v26
how he entered into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the presentation, which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests) and also gave _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to those who were with him?"

###### v27
And he said to them, "The Sabbath was established for people, and not people for the Sabbath.

###### v28
So then, the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
