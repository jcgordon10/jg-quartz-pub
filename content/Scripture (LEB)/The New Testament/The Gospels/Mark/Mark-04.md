###### v1
And again he began to teach beside the sea, ^[That is, the Sea of Galilee] and a very large crowd was gathered to him, so that he got into a boat _and_ ^[Here "and" is supplied because the previous participle ("got") has been translated as a finite verb] sat on the sea, and the whole crowd was at the sea on the land.

###### v2
And he began to teach ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to teach")] them many _things_ in parables, and was saying to them in his teaching,

###### v3
"Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow.

###### v4
And it happened that while _he_ was sowing, _some seed_ ^[Literally "_some of_ which"] fell on the side of the path, and the birds came and devoured it.

###### v5
And other _seed_ fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once, because it did not have _any_ depth of soil.

###### v6
And when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it did not have _enough_ root, it withered.

###### v7
And other _seed_ fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it, and it did not produce grain. ^[Literally "fruit," describing here the grain harvested from the healthy plants; in contemporary English this would more naturally be expressed by terms like "grain" or "crop"]

###### v8
And other _seed_ fell on the good soil, and produced grain, ^[Literally "fruit," describing here the grain harvested from the healthy plants; in contemporary English this would more naturally be expressed by terms like "grain" or "crop"] coming up and increasing, and it bore _a crop_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]--one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred _times as much_. ^[The phrase "_times as much_" is not in the Greek text but is implied]

###### v9
And he said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!"

###### v10
And when he was alone, those around him together with the twelve began asking ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began asking")] him about the parables.

###### v11
And he said to them, "To you has been granted the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside everything is in parables,

###### v12
so that
'_they may look closely_ ^[Literally "seeing they may see"] and not perceive,
and _they may listen carefully_ ^[Literally "hearing they may hear"] and not understand,
lest they turn and it be forgiven them.'" ^[A quotation from [[Isa-06#v9|Isa 6:9–10]][[Isa-06#v10|]]]

###### v13
And he said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? And how will you understand all the parables?

###### v14
The sower sows the word.

###### v15
And these are the ones beside the path where the word is sown, and whenever they hear _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.

###### v16
And these are like ^[Some manuscripts omit "like"] the ones sown on the rocky ground, who whenever they hear the word immediately receive it with joy.

###### v17
And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("comes")] affliction or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away.

###### v18
And others are the ones sown among the thorn plants--these are the ones who hear the word,

###### v19
and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other _things_ come in _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("come in") has been translated as a finite verb] choke the word and it becomes unproductive.

###### v20
And those are the ones sown on the good soil, who hear the word and receive _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and bear fruit--one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred _times as much_." ^[The phrase "_times as much_" is not in the Greek text but is implied]

###### v21
And he said to them, "Surely a lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a bushel basket or under a bed, _is it_? ^[The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase "_is it_"] _Is it_ not ^[The negative construction in Greek anticipates a positive answer here] so that it may be put on a lampstand?

###### v22
For nothing is secret except so that it may be revealed, nor has become hidden except so that it will come to light.

###### v23
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"

###### v24
And he said to them, "Take care what you hear! With the measure by which you measure out, it will be measured out to you, and will be added to you.

###### v25
For whoever has, _more_ will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."

###### v26
And he said, "The kingdom of God is like this: like a man scatters seed on the ground.

###### v27
And he sleeps and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows--_he does not know how_. ^[Literally "_in such a way_ as he does not know"]

###### v28
By itself the soil produces a crop: first the grass, then the head of grain, then the full grain in the head.

###### v29
But when the crop permits, he sends _in_ the sickle right away, because the harvest has come."

###### v30
And he said, "With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or by what parable can we present it?

###### v31
_It is_ like a mustard seed that when sown on the ground, _although it_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is") which is understood as concessive] is the smallest of all the seeds that _are_ on the ground,

###### v32
but when it is sown it grows up and becomes the largest of all the garden herbs, and sends out large branches so that the birds of the sky are able to nest in its shade."

###### v33
And with many parables such as these he was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear _it_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v34
And he did not speak to them without a parable, but in private he explained everything to his own disciples.

###### v35
And on that day, _when it_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was")] was evening, he said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side."

###### v36
And leaving the crowd, they took him along, as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.

###### v37
And a great storm of wind developed, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already being filled _with water_. ^[*The words "_with water_" are not in the Greek text but are implied]

###### v38
And he was in the stern sleeping on the cushion, and they woke him up and said to him, "Teacher, is it not a concern to you that we are perishing?"

###### v39
And he woke up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("woke up") has been translated as a finite verb] rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Be quiet! Be silent!" And the wind abated and there was a great calm.

###### v40
And he said to them, "Why are you fearful? Do you not yet have faith?"

###### v41
