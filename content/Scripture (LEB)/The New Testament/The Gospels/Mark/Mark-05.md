###### v1
And they came to the other side of the sea, ^[That is, the Sea of Galilee] to the region of the Gerasenes. ^[Most later manuscripts read "Gadarenes," while other manuscripts read "Gergesenes" here]

###### v2
And _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was getting out")] he was getting out of the boat, immediately from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit went to meet him,

###### v3
who _lived_ ^[Literally "had his dwelling"] among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him any longer, not even with a chain,

###### v4
because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles had been shattered. And no one was strong _enough_ to subdue him.

###### v5
And during every night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.

###### v6
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before him.

###### v7
And crying out with a loud voice he said, "_What have I to do with you_ ^[Literally "what to me and to you"], Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me!"

###### v8
(For he was saying to him, "Come out of the man, unclean spirit!")

###### v9
And he was asking him "_What is your name_?" ^[Literally "what name to you"] And he said to him, "My name _is_ Legion, because we are many."

###### v10
And he was imploring him many _times_ that he would not send them out of the region.

###### v11
Now a large herd of pigs was there at the hill feeding,

###### v12
and they implored him, saying, "Send us to the pigs so that we may enter into them."

###### v13
And he permitted them. And the unclean spirits came out _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came out") has been translated as a finite verb] entered into the pigs, and the herd--about two thousand--rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea.

###### v14
And their herdsmen fled and reported _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] in the town and in the countryside, and they came to see what it was that had happened.

###### v15
And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting _there_ clothed and in his right mind--the one who had had the legion--and they were afraid.

###### v16
And those who had seen _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and about the pigs.

###### v17
And they began to urge him to depart from their region.

###### v18
And _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was getting")] he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed began to implore ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to implore")] him that he could go with him.

###### v19
And he did not permit him, but said to him, "Go to your home to your _people_ and tell them all that the Lord has done for you, and _that_ he has had mercy on you."

###### v20
And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him, and they were all astonished.

###### v21
And _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("had crossed over")] Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered to him, and he was beside the sea.

###### v22
And one of the rulers of the synagogue came--Jairus by name--and _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw him, he fell down at his feet.

###### v23
And he was imploring him many _times_, saying, "My little daughter _is at the point of death_! ^[Literally "has finally"] Come, lay your ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hands on her, so that she will get well and will live."

###### v24
And he went with him, and a large crowd was following him and pressing around him.

###### v25
And _there was_ a woman who was _suffering from hemorrhages_ ^[Literally "with a flow of blood"] twelve years.

###### v26
And she had endured many _things_ under many physicians, and had spent _all that she had_ ^[Literally "all with her"] and had received no _help_ at all, but instead _became worse_. ^[Literally "came back for the worse"]

###### v27
_When she_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind _him_ _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] touched his cloak,

###### v28
for she was saying, "If I touch just his clothing, I will be healed!"

###### v29
And immediately her _hemorrhage stopped_ ^[Literally "flow of blood was dried up"] and she realized in her ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] body that she was healed of her ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] suffering.

###### v30
And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself _that_ power had gone out from himself, turned around in the crowd _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("turned around") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Who touched my clothing?"

###### v31
And his disciples said to him, "You see the crowd pressing upon you, and you say 'Who touched me?'"

###### v32
And he was looking around to see the one who had done this.

###### v33
So the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.

###### v34
But he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well from your suffering."

###### v35
_While_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("speaking")] he was still speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler's _house_ ^[Here "_house_" is implied since the synagogue ruler himself is directly addressed (and therefore present) in the remainder of this verse] saying, "Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher further?"

###### v36
But Jesus, ignoring ^[Or "overhearing"] _what was said_, ^[Literally "the report that was spoken"] told the ruler of the synagogue, "Do not be afraid--only believe!"

###### v37
And he did not allow anyone to follow along with him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.

###### v38
And they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and saw a commotion, and _people_ weeping and wailing loudly.

###### v39
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("entered") which is understood as temporal] entered, he said to them, "Why are you agitated and weeping? The child is not dead, but is sleeping."

###### v40
And they began laughing ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began laughing")] at him. But he sent _them_ all out _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("sent … out") has been translated as a finite verb] took along the father and mother of the child, and those _who were_ with him, and went in to where the child was.

###### v41
And taking hold of the child's hand, he said to her, "_Talitha koum!_" (which is translated, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!"),

###### v42
and immediately the girl stood up and began walking around ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began walking around")] (for she was twelve years old). And _immediately they were utterly and completely astonished_. ^[Literally "immediately they were astonished with great astonishment"]

###### v43
And he commanded them strictly that no one should learn of this, and said to give her _something_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to eat.
