###### v1
And the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered to him.

###### v2
And they saw that some of his disciples were eating their ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] bread with unclean--that is, unwashed--hands.

###### v3
(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands _ritually_, ^[Literally "with the fist"; although the exact meaning of the phrase is uncertain, there is general agreement it has to do with the ritual or ceremonial nature of the handwashing] _thus_ ^[Here "_thus_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("holding fast to") which is understood as result] holding fast to the traditions of the elders.

###### v4
And _when they come_ ^[The phrase "_when they come_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other _traditions_ ^[The word "_traditions_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] which they have received _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("have received") has been translated as a finite verb] hold fast to--_for example,_ ^[The phrase "_for example_" is not in the Greek text but is supplied as a clarification in the English translation] the washing of cups and pitchers and bronze kettles and dining couches.) ^[Several important manuscripts omit "and dining couches"]

###### v5
And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] bread with unclean hands?"

###### v6
So he said to them, "Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written,
'This people honors me with their ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] lips,
but their heart is far, far away from me.

###### v7
And they worship me in vain,
teaching _as_ doctrines the commandments of men.' ^[A quotation from [[Isa-29#v13|Isa 29:13]]]

###### v8
Abandoning the commandment of God, you hold fast to the tradition of men."

###### v9
And he said to them, "You splendidly ignore the commandment of God so that you can keep ^[Some manuscripts have "you can maintain"] your tradition.

###### v10
For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' ^[A quotation from [[Exod-20#v12|Exod 20:12]]; [[Deut-05#v16|Deut 5:16]]] and, 'The one who speaks evil of father or mother _must certainly die_ ^[Literally "let him die the death"].' ^[A quotation from [[Exod-21#v17|Exod 21:17]]; [[Lev-20#v9|Lev 20:9]]]

###### v11
But you say, 'If a man says to his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] father or to his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] mother, "Whatever _benefit you would have received_ ^[Literally "you would have been benefited"] from me _is_ _corban_" ^[A Hebrew term referring to something consecrated as a gift to God and thus not available for ordinary use] (that is, a gift _to God_),

###### v12
you no longer permit him to do anything for his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] father or his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] mother,

###### v13
_thus_ ^[Here "_thus_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("making void") which is understood as result] making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down, and you do many similar _things_ such as this."

###### v14
And summoning the crowd again, he said to them, "Listen to me, all _of you_, and understand:

###### v15
There is nothing outside of a person that is able to defile him _by_ ^[Here "_by_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("going") which is understood as means] going into him. But the things that go out of a person are the things that defile a person." ^[Most later manuscripts add v. [[Mark-07#v16|16]], "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."]

###### v17
And when he entered into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable.

###### v18
And he said to them, "So are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything _that is_ outside that goes into a person _is_ not able to defile him?

###### v19
For it does not enter into his heart but into his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] stomach, and goes out into the latrine"--_thus_ ^[Here "_thus_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("declaring") which is understood as result] declaring all foods clean.

###### v20
And he said, "What comes out of a person, that defiles a person.

###### v21
For from within, from the heart of people, come evil plans, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders,

###### v22
adulteries, _acts of_ greed, malicious _deeds_, deceit, licentiousness, _envy_, ^[Literally "the evil eye"] abusive speech, pride, foolishness.

###### v23
All these evil _things_ come from within and defile a person."

###### v24
And from there he set out _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("set out") has been translated as a finite verb] went to the region of Tyre. And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("entered") which is understood as temporal] entered into a house, he wanted no one to know, and _yet_ he was not able to escape notice.

###### v25
But immediately a woman whose young daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, _when she_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard about him, came _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came") has been translated as a finite verb] fell down at his feet,

###### v26
Now the woman was a Greek--a Syrophoenician by nationality--and she was asking him that he would expel the demon from her daughter.

###### v27
And he said to her, "Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to the dogs!"

###### v28
But she answered and said to him, "Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."

###### v29
And he said to her, "Because of this statement, go! The demon has gone out of your daughter."

###### v30
And _when she_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("went") which is understood as temporal] went to her home, she found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone.

###### v31
And again he went away from the region of Tyre _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went away") has been translated as a finite verb] came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of the Decapolis.

###### v32
And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they were imploring him that he would place his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hand on him.

###### v33
And he took him away from the crowd by himself _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took … away") has been translated as a finite verb] put his fingers into his ears, and _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("spitting") which is understood as temporal] spitting, he touched his tongue.

###### v34
And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, "_Ephphatha!_" (that is, "Be opened!").

###### v35
And ^[Some manuscripts have "And immediately"] his ears were opened and _his difficulty in speaking was removed_ ^[Literally "the bond of his tongue was loosened"] and he began to speak normally.

###### v36
And he ordered them that they should say nothing, but as much as he ordered them _not to_, they proclaimed _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] even more instead.

###### v37
And they were amazed beyond all measure, saying, "He has done all _things_ well! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!"
