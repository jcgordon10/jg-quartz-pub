###### v1
In those days there was ^[Here the participle ("was") is translated as a finite verb because of English style] again a large crowd, and they did not have ^[Here the participle ("have") is translated as a finite verb because of English style] anything they could eat. Summoning the disciples, he said to them,

###### v2
"I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat.

###### v3
And if I send them away hungry to their homes they will give out on the way, and some of them have come from far away."

###### v4
And his disciples answered him, "Where is anyone able to feed these _people_ with bread here in the desert?"

###### v5
And he asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" So they said, "Seven."

###### v6
And he commanded the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground, and taking the seven loaves, _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had given thanks") which is understood as temporal] had given thanks he broke _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and began giving ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began giving")] _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to his disciples so that they could set _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] before _them_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] And they set _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] before the crowd.

###### v7
And they had a few small fish, and _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("giving thanks") which is understood as temporal] giving thanks for them, he said to set these _before them_ also.

###### v8
And they ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces that were left, seven baskets _full_.

###### v9
Now there were about four thousand. And he sent them away.

###### v10
And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("got") has been translated as a finite verb] went to the district of Dalmanutha.

###### v11
And the Pharisees came and began to argue with him, demanding from him a sign from heaven _in order to_ ^[Here "_in order to_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("test") which is understood as purpose] test him.

###### v12
And sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, "Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation!"

###### v13
And he left them, got into _the boat_ ^[Here the words "_the boat_" are not in the Greek text but must be supplied] again, _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participles ("left" and "got into") have been translated as finite verbs] went to the other side.

###### v14
And they had forgotten to take bread, and except _for_ one loaf, they did not have _any_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] with them in the boat.

###### v15
And he ordered them, saying, "Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod!"

###### v16
And they began to discuss with one another that they had no bread.

###### v17
And knowing _this_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] he said to them, "Why are you discussing that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Have your hearts been hardened?

###### v18
_Although you_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as concessive] have eyes, do you not see? And _although you_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as concessive] have ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?

###### v19
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?" They said to him, "Twelve."

###### v20
"When _I_ also ^[Some manuscripts omit "also"] _broke_ ^[The words "_I broke_" are not in the Greek text, but are understood based on the previous verse] the seven _loaves_ ^[The word "_loaves_" is not in the Greek text, but is understood based on the previous verse] for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?" And they said to him, "Seven."

###### v21
And he said to them, "Do you not yet understand?"

###### v22
And they came to Bethsaida. And they brought to him a blind man and implored him that he would touch him.

###### v23
And he took hold of the blind man's hand _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took hold of") has been translated as a finite verb] led him outside the village, and _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("spitting") which is understood as temporal] spitting in his eyes, he placed his hands on him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("placed") has been translated as a finite verb] asked him, "Do you see anything?"

###### v24
And looking up he said, "I see people, for I see _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] like trees walking around."

###### v25
Then he placed his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hands on his eyes again, and he opened his eyes and was cured, and could see everything clearly.

###### v26
And he sent him to his home, saying, "Do not even go into the village."

###### v27
And Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, "Who do people say _that_ I am?"

###### v28
And they told him, saying, "John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others that _you are_ one of the prophets."

###### v29
And he asked them, "But who do you say _that_ I am?" Peter answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, "You are the Christ!"

###### v30
And he warned them that they should tell no one about him.

###### v31
And he began to teach them that it was necessary _for_ the Son of Man to suffer many _things_ and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise.

###### v32
And he was speaking openly _about_ the subject, and Peter took him aside _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took … aside") has been translated as a finite verb] began to rebuke him.

###### v33
But turning around and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, "Get behind me, Satan, because you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but the things of people!"

###### v34
And summoning the crowd together with his disciples, he said to them, "If anyone wants to come ^[Some manuscripts have "to follow"] after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.

###### v35
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me and of the gospel will save it.

###### v36
For what does it benefit a person to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?

###### v37
For what can a person give in exchange for his life?

###### v38
For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
