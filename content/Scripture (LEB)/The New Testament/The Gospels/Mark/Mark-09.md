###### v2
And after six days, Jesus took along Peter and James and John, and led them to a high mountain by themselves alone. And he was transfigured before them,

###### v3
and his clothing became radiant--extremely white, like no cloth refiner on earth can _make so white_. ^[Literally "make white like this"]

###### v4
And Elijah appeared to them together with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.

###### v5
And Peter answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good _that_ we are here! And let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."

###### v9
And _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were coming down")] they were coming down from the mountain, he ordered them that they should tell no one _the things_ that they had seen, except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead.

###### v12
And he said to them, "Elijah indeed does come first _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("does come") has been translated as a finite verb] restores all _things_. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man that he should suffer many _things_ and be treated with contempt?

But I tell you that indeed Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him."

And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down and he foams at the mouth and grinds his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] teeth and becomes paralyzed.

###### v19
And he answered them _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "O unbelieving generation! _How long_ ^[Literally "until when"] will I be with you? _How long_ ^[Literally "until when"] must I put up with you? Bring him to me!"

###### v20
And they brought him to him. And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw him, the spirit immediately convulsed him, and falling on the ground, he began to roll around, foaming at the mouth.

###### v21
And he asked his father how long it was since this had been happening to him. And he said, "From childhood.

###### v22

###### v26
And it came out, screaming and convulsing _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] greatly, and he became as if _he were_ dead, so that most _of them_ said, "He has died!"

###### v27
But Jesus took hold of his hand _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took hold of") has been translated as a finite verb] raised him up, and he stood up.
