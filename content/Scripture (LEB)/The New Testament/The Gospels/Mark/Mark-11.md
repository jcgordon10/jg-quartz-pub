And if anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say ^[Some manuscripts omit "that" after "say" here; though understood to be present in the underlying Greek text, it introduces direct discourse here and is left untranslated, functioning much like English quotation marks] 'The Lord has need of it, and will send it here again at once.'"
