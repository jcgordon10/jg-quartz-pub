###### v1
And he began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard, and put a fence _around it_, and dug a trough for the winepress, and built a watchtower, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey.

###### v2
And he sent a slave to the tenant farmers at the proper time, so that he could collect _some_ of the fruit of the vineyard from the tenant farmers.

###### v3
And they seized him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("seized") has been translated as a finite verb] beat _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and sent _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] away empty-handed.

###### v4
And again he sent to them another slave, and that one they struck on the head and dishonored.

###### v5
And he sent another, and that one they killed. And _he sent_ ^[The words "_he sent_" are not in the Greek text, but are an implied repetition from earlier in the verse] many others, _some_ of whom they beat and _some_ of whom they killed.

###### v6
He had one more, a beloved son. Last _of all_ he sent him to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'

###### v7
But those tenant farmers said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours!'

###### v8
And they seized _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("seized") has been translated as a finite verb] killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.

###### v9
What ^[Some manuscripts have "What then"] will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others.

###### v10
Have you not read this scripture:
'The stone which the builders rejected,
this has become _the cornerstone_. ^[Literally "the head of the corner"]

###### v11
This came about from the Lord,
and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" ^[A quotation from [[Ps-118#v22|Ps 118:22–23]][[Ps-118#v23|]]]

###### v12
And they were seeking to arrest him, and they were afraid of the crowd, because they knew that he had told the parable with reference to them. And they left him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("left") has been translated as a finite verb] went away.

###### v13
And they sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him so that they could catch him unawares in a statement.

###### v14
And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came") which is understood as temporal] came, they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and _you do not care what anyone thinks_, ^[Literally "it is not a care to you concerning anyone"] _because you do not regard the opinion of people_ ^[Literally "because you do not look at the face of men"] but teach the way of God in truth. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or should we not pay?"

###### v15
But _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("knew") which is understood as causal] knew their hypocrisy, he said to them, "Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius so that I can look at _it_!" ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v16
So they brought _one_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] And he said to them, "Whose image and inscription _is_ this?" And they said to him, "Caesar's."

###### v17
And Jesus said to them, "Give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!" And they were utterly amazed at him.

###### v18
And Sadducees--who say there is no resurrection--came up to him and began to ask ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to ask")] him, saying,

###### v19
"Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if someone's brother dies and he leaves behind a wife and does not leave a child, that his brother should take the wife and _father_ ^[Literally "raise up"] descendants for his brother.

###### v20
There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife. And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("died") which is understood as temporal] died, he did not leave descendants.

###### v21
And the second took her, and he died without leaving descendants. And the third likewise.

###### v22
And the seven did not leave descendants. Last of all the woman also died.

###### v23
In the resurrection, when they rise, _whose_ ^[Literally "who of them"] wife will she be? For the seven had her _as_ wife.

###### v24
Jesus said to them, "Are you not deceived because of this, _because you_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal] do not know the scriptures or the power of God?

###### v25
For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.

###### v26
Now concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses _in the passage about the bush_ ^[Literally "at the bush"] how God spoke to him, saying, 'I _am_ the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'? ^[A quotation from [[Exod-03#v6|Exod 3:6]]]

###### v27
He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are very much mistaken!"

###### v28
And one of the scribes came up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] heard them debating. _When he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw that he answered them well, he asked him, "Which commandment is the most important of all?"

###### v29
Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Listen, Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one.

###### v30
And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.' ^[A quotation from [[Deut-06#v4|Deut 6:4–5]][[Deut-06#v5|]]; [[Josh-22#v5|Josh 22:5]]]

###### v31
The second _is_ this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' ^[A quotation from [[Lev-19#v18|Lev 19:18]]] There is no other commandment greater than these."

###### v32
And the scribe said to him, "That is true, Teacher. You have said _correctly_ ^[Literally "in accordance with truth"] that he is one and there is no other except him.

###### v33
And to love him from your ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] whole heart and from your ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] whole understanding and from your ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] whole strength, and to love your ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] neighbor as yourself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."

###### v34
And Jesus, _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw that he had answered thoughtfully, said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And no one dared to put a question to him any longer.

###### v35
And continuing, Jesus said _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("teaching") which is understood as temporal] teaching in the temple _courts_, ^[*Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] "How can the scribes say that the Christ is David's son?

###### v36
David himself said by the Holy Spirit,
'The Lord said to my Lord,
"Sit at my right hand,
until I put your enemies
under your feet."' ^[A quotation from [[Ps-110#v1|Ps 110:1]]]

###### v37
David himself calls him 'Lord,' and how is he his son?" And the large crowd was listening to him gladly.

###### v38
And in his teaching he said, "Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and greetings in the marketplaces

###### v39
and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets,

###### v40
who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy _prayers_ for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!"

###### v41
And he sat down opposite the contribution box _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("sat down") has been translated as a finite verb] was observing how the crowd was putting coins into the contribution box. And many rich people were putting in many _coins_. ^[Although often translated "large sums," the plural here suggests large numbers of individual coins, which would make an impressive noise]

###### v42
And one poor widow came _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came") has been translated as a finite verb] put in two small copper coins ^[This coin was the _lepton_, worth 1/128 of a denarius] (that is, a penny). ^[This coin was the _quadrans_, the smallest Roman coin, worth 2 _lepta_]

###### v43
And summoning his disciples, he said to them, "Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all those who put _offerings_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] into the contribution box.

###### v44
For they all _contributed_ ^[Literally "put in"] out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everything she had, her whole means of subsistence."
