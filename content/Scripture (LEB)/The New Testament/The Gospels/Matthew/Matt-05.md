###### v1
Now _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw the crowds, he went up the mountain and _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("sat down") which is understood as temporal] sat down, his disciples approached him.

###### v2
And opening his mouth he began to teach them, saying,

###### v3
"Blessed _are_ the poor in spirit,
because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

###### v4
Blessed _are_ the ones who mourn,
because they will be comforted.

###### v5
Blessed _are_ the meek,
because they will inherit the earth.

###### v6
Blessed _are_ the ones who hunger and thirst _for_ righteousness,
because they will be satisfied.

###### v7
Blessed _are_ the merciful,
because they will be shown mercy.

###### v8
Blessed _are_ the pure in heart,
because they will see God.

###### v9
Blessed _are_ the peacemakers,
because they will be called sons of God.

###### v10
Blessed _are_ those who are persecuted because of righteousness,
because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

###### v11
Blessed are you
when they insult you and persecute _you_ and say all kinds of evil things against you, lying on account of me.

###### v12
Rejoice and be glad, because your reward _is_ great in heaven, for in the _same_ way they persecuted the prophets before you.

###### v13
"You are the salt of the earth. But if salt becomes tasteless, by what will it be made salty? It is good for nothing any longer except to be thrown outside _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("thrown") has been translated as a finite verb] trampled under foot by people.

###### v14
You are the light of the world. A city located on top of a hill cannot be hidden,

###### v15
nor do they light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house.

###### v16
In the _same_ way let your light shine before people, so that they can see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

###### v17
"Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy _them_ but to fulfill _them_.

###### v18
For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one tiny letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all takes place.

###### v19
Therefore whoever abolishes one of the least of these commandments and teaches people to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever keeps _them_ and teaches _them_, this person will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

###### v20
For I say to you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses _that_ of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven.

###### v21
"You have heard that it was said to the _people of old_, ^[Literally "ancients"] 'Do not commit murder,' ^[A quotation from [[Exod-20#v13|Exod 20:13]]; [[Deut-05#v17|Deut 5:17]]] and 'whoever commits murder will be subject to judgment.'

###### v22
But I say to you that everyone who is angry at his brother will be subject to judgment, and whoever says to his brother, 'Stupid fool!' ^[Greek "Raca," a term of verbal abuse involving lack of intelligence] will be subject to the council, and whoever says, 'Obstinate fool!' ^[Perhaps with the idea of obstinate, godless foolishness; some take the word to be a Greek transliteration of the Hebrew word for "rebel" ([[Deut-21#v18|Deut 21:18]], [[Deut-21#v20|20]])] will be subject to fiery hell.

###### v23
Therefore if you present your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,

###### v24
leave your gift there before the altar and first go be reconciled to your brother, and then come _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("come") has been translated as a finite verb] present your gift.

###### v25
_Settle the case quickly with your accuser_ ^[Literally "be making friends quickly with your accuser"] while you are with him on the way, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.

###### v26
Truly I say to you, you will never come out of there until you have paid back the last penny!

###### v27
"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' ^[A quotation from [[Exod-20#v14|Exod 20:14]]; [[Deut-05#v17|Deut 5:17]]]

###### v28
But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

###### v29
And if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw _it_ from you! For it is better for you that one of your members be destroyed than your whole body be thrown into hell.

###### v30
And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw _it_ from you! For it is better for you that one of your limbs be destroyed than your whole body go into hell.

###### v31
"And it was said, 'Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' ^[A quotation from [[Deut-24#v1|Deut 24:1]]]

###### v32
But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for a matter of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

###### v33
"Again you have heard that it was said to the _people of old_, ^[Literally "ancients"] 'Do not swear falsely, ^[Or "do not break your oath"] but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.' ^[A quotation from [[Lev-19#v12|Lev 19:12]]]

###### v34
But I say to you, do not swear at all, either by heaven, because it is the throne of God,

###### v35
or by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet, or by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great king.

###### v36
And do not swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.

###### v37
But let your statement be 'Yes, yes; no, no,' and anything beyond these is from the evil one. ^[Or "is of evil"]

###### v38
"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' ^[A quotation from [[Exod-21#v24|Exod 21:24]]; [[Lev-24#v20|Lev 24:20]]]

###### v39
But I say to you, do not resist the evildoer, but whoever strikes you on the right cheek, ^[Some manuscripts have "your right cheek"] turn the other to him also.

###### v40
And the one who wants to go to court with you and take your tunic, _let him have_ ^[Literally "leave to him"] your outer garment also.

###### v41
And whoever forces you to go one mile, ^[A Roman mile was originally a thousand paces, but was later fixed at eight stades (1,478.5 meters)] go with him two.

###### v42
Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

###### v43
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor' ^[A quotation from [[Lev-19#v18|Lev 19:18]]] and 'Hate your enemy.' ^[An allusion to [[Deut-23#v3|Deut 23:3–6]][[Deut-23#v4|]][[Deut-23#v5|]][[Deut-23#v6|]]]

###### v44
But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,

###### v45
in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, because he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust.

###### v46
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not the tax collectors also do the same?

###### v47
And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing that is remarkable? Do not the Gentiles also do the same?

###### v48
Therefore you be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.
