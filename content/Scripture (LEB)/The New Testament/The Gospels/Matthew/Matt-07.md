###### v1
"Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.

###### v2
For by what judgment you judge, you will be judged, and by what measure you measure out, it will be measured out to you.

###### v3
And why do you see the speck _that is_ in your brother's eye, but do not notice the beam of wood in your _own_ eye?

###### v4
Or how will you say to your brother, 'Allow _me_ to remove the speck from your eye,' and behold, the beam of wood _is_ in your _own_ eye?

###### v5
Hypocrite! First remove the beam of wood from your _own_ eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye!

###### v6
"Do not give what is holy to dogs, or throw your pearls in front of pigs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn around _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("turn around") has been translated as a finite verb] tear you to pieces.

###### v7
"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened for you.

###### v8
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.

###### v9
Or what man is _there_ among you, _if_ his son will ask him _for_ bread, will give him a stone?

###### v10
Or also _if_ he will ask for a fish, will give him a snake?

###### v11
Therefore if you, _although you_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as concessive] are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?

###### v12
Therefore _in_ all _things_, whatever you want that people should do to you, thus also you do to them. For this is the law and the prophets.

###### v13
"Enter through the narrow gate, because broad _is_ the gate and spacious _is_ the road that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it,

###### v14
because narrow ^[Some manuscripts have "how narrow"] _is_ the gate and constricted _is_ the road that leads to life, and there are few who find it!

###### v15
"Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inside are ravenous wolves.

###### v16
You will recognize them by their fruits: they do not gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles, _do they_? ^[The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated by "_do they_"]

###### v17
In the _same_ way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit.

###### v18
A good tree is not able to produce bad fruit, nor a bad tree to produce good fruit.

###### v19
Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

###### v20
As a result, you will recognize them by their fruits.

###### v21
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

###### v22
On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many miracles in your name?'

###### v23
And then _I will say to them plainly_, ^[Literally "I will declare to them"] 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness!'

###### v24
"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.

###### v25
And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it did not collapse, because its foundation was laid on the rock.

###### v26
And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.

###### v27
And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it collapsed, and its fall was great."

###### v28
And it happened when Jesus finished these words the crowds were amazed at his teaching,

###### v29
because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like their scribes.
