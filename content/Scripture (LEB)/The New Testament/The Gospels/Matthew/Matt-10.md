###### v4
Simon the Zealot, ^[Literally "the Cananean," but according to BDAG 507 s.v., this term has no relation at all to the geographical terms for Cana or Canaan, but is derived from the Aramaic term for "enthusiast, zealot" (see [[Luke-06#v15|Luke 6:15]]; [[Acts-01#v13|Acts 1:13]])] and Judas Iscariot--the one who also betrayed him.

###### v5

###### v10
Do not _take_ a traveler's bag for the road, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff, for the worker _is_ deserving of his provisions.

###### v11
And into whatever town or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay _there_ until you depart.

###### v12
And _when you_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("enter") which is understood as temporal] enter into the house, greet it.

###### v15
Truly I say to you, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town!

###### v16

###### v24
"A disciple is not superior to his teacher, nor a slave superior to his master.
