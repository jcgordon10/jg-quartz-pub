###### v1
And it happened that when Jesus had finished giving orders to his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and to preach in their towns.

###### v2
Now _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] John ^[That is, John the Baptist] heard in prison the deeds of Christ, he sent _word_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] by his disciples

###### v3
_and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("sent" in the previous verse) has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"

###### v4
And Jesus answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to them, "Go _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("go") has been translated as a finite verb] tell John what you hear and see:

###### v5
the blind receive sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor have good news announced to _them_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v6
And whoever is not offended by me is blessed."

###### v7
Now _as_ ^[Here "_as_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were going away")] these were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

###### v8
But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings.

###### v9
But why did you go out? To see a prophet? ^[Some manuscripts have "But what did you go out to see? A prophet?"] Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet!

###### v10
It is this man about whom it is written:
'Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face,
who will prepare your way before you.' ^[A quotation from [[Mal-03#v1|Mal 3:1;]] cf. [[Mark-01#v2|Mark 1:2]]]

###### v11
Truly I say to you, among _those_ born of women there has not arisen _one_ greater than John the Baptist. But the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

###### v12
But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven is treated violently, and the violent claim ^[Or "seize"] it.

###### v13
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John,

###### v14
and if you are willing to accept _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] he is Elijah, the one who is going to come.

###### v15
The one who has ears, let him hear!

###### v16
"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to one another,

###### v17
saying,
'We played the flute for you and you did not dance;
we sang a lament and you did not mourn.'

###### v18
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon!'

###### v19
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a man _who is_ a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds." ^[Many Greek manuscripts, including most later ones, read "children"]

###### v20
Then he began to reproach the towns in which the majority of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent:

###### v21
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

###### v22
Nevertheless I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon on the day of judgment than for you!

###### v23
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.

###### v24
Nevertheless I tell you that it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you!"

###### v25
At that time Jesus answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these _things_ from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to young children. ^[Or perhaps "to the childlike," or "to the innocent"]

###### v26
Yes, Father, for _to do_ so _was your gracious will_. ^[Literally "was pleasing before you"]

###### v27
All _things_ have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and _anyone to whom_ ^[Literally "to whomever"] the Son wants to reveal _him_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v28
Come to me, all _of you_ who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.

###### v29
Take my yoke on you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

For my yoke _is_ easy to carry and my burden is light."
