###### v1
On that day Jesus went out of the house _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went out") has been translated as a finite verb] was sitting by the sea. ^[That is, the Sea of Galilee]

###### v2
And large crowds gathered close around him, so that he got into a boat to sit down, and all the crowd was standing on the shore.

###### v3
And he spoke many _things_ to them in parables, saying, "Behold, the sower went out to sow,

###### v4
and while he was sowing, _some seed_ ^[Literally "some of which"] fell on the side of the path, and the birds came _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came") has been translated as a finite verb] devoured it.

###### v5
And other _seed_ fell on the rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once because it did not have _any_ depth of soil.

###### v6
But _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("rose")] the sun rose it was scorched, and because it did not have _enough_ root, it withered.

###### v7
And other _seed_ fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it.

###### v8
But other _seed_ fell on the good soil and produced grain, ^[Literally "fruit," describing here the grain harvested from the healthy plants; in contemporary English this would more naturally be expressed by terms like "grain" or "crop"] this one a hundred _times as much_ and this one sixty and this one thirty.

###### v9
The one who has ears, let him hear!"

###### v10
And the disciples came up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, "_Why_ ^[Literally "because of what"] do you speak to them in parables?"

###### v11
And he answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to them, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to those _people_ it has not been granted.

###### v12
For whoever has, to him _more_ will be given, and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.

###### v13
For this _reason_ I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand,

###### v14
and with reference to them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says,
"_You will listen carefully_ ^[Literally "with hearing you will hear"] and will never understand,
and _you will look closely_ ^[Literally "seeing you will see"] and will never perceive.

###### v15
For the heart of this people has become dull,
and with their ears they hear with difficulty,
and they have shut their eyes,
so that they would not see with their eyes
and hear with their ears
and understand with their heart
and turn, and I would heal them." ^[A quotation from [[Isa-06#v9|Isa 6:9–10]][[Isa-06#v10|]]]

###### v16
But your eyes _are_ blessed because they see, and your ears because they hear.

###### v17
For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous _people_ longed to see what you see, and did not see _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and to hear what you hear, and did not hear _it_! ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v18
"You, therefore, listen to the parable of the sower:

###### v19
_When_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("hears")] anyone hears the word about the kingdom and does not understand _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown on the side of the path.

###### v20
And what was sown on the rocky ground--this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.

###### v21
But he does not have a root in himself, but _lasts only a little while_, ^[Literally "is temporary"] and _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("happens")] affliction or persecution happens because of the word, immediately he falls away.

###### v22
And what was sown into the thorn plants--this is the one who hears the word, and the anxiety of this world ^[Some manuscripts have "of the world"] and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word and it becomes unproductive.

###### v23
But what was sown on the good soil--this is the one who hears the word and understands _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] who indeed bears fruit and produces, this one a hundred _times as much_, and this one sixty, and this one thirty."

###### v24
He put before them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.

###### v25
But while his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed darnel ^[A weed that looks similar to wheat but has poisonous seeds] in the midst of the wheat and went away.

###### v26
So when the _wheat_ ^[Literally "grass," "hay," but in this context referring to the good plants as opposed to the weeds] sprouted and yielded grain, then the darnel appeared also.

###### v27
So the slaves of the master of the house came _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, 'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have darnel?'

###### v28
And he said to them, 'An enemy has done this!' So the slaves said to him, 'Then do you want us to go _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("go") has been translated as an English infinitive] gather them?'

###### v29
But he said, "No, lest _when you_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("gather") which is understood as temporal] gather the darnel you uproot the wheat together with it.

###### v30
Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the season of the harvest I will tell the reapers, "First gather the darnel and tie it into bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my storehouse."'"

###### v31
He put before them another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took") has been translated as a finite verb] sowed in his field.

###### v32
_It_ ^[Literally "which," but a new sentence is started here in the English translation] is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it is grown it is larger than the garden herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches."

###### v33
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took") has been translated as a finite verb] put into three measures of wheat flour until the whole _batch_ was leavened."

###### v34
Jesus spoke all these _things_ to the crowds in parables, and he was saying nothing to them without a parable,

###### v35
in order that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled, who said,
"I will open my mouth in parables;
I will proclaim what has been hidden since the creation." ^[A quotation from [[Ps-78#v2|Ps 78:2]]] ^[Some manuscripts have "since the creation of the world"]

###### v36
Then he left the crowds _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("left") has been translated as a finite verb] came into the house, and his disciples came to him saying, "Explain the parable of the darnel in the field to us."

###### v37
So he answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,

###### v38
and the field is the world. And the good seed--these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil one.

###### v39
And the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.

###### v40
Thus just as the darnel is gathered and burned ^[Some manuscripts have "burned up"] with fire, so it will be at the end of the age.

###### v41
The Son of Man will send out his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all the causes of sin and those who do lawless deeds,

###### v42
and throw them into the fiery furnace. ^[An allusion to [[Dan-03#v6|Dan 3:6]]] In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!

###### v43
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. ^[An allusion to [[Dan-12#v3|Dan 12:3]]] The one who has ears, let him hear!

###### v44
"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, that a man found _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("found") has been translated as a finite verb] concealed, and in his joy he goes and sells everything that he has and buys that field.

###### v45
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.

###### v46
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("found") which is understood as temporal] found one very valuable pearl, he went _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went") has been translated as a finite verb] sold everything that he possessed and purchased it.

###### v47
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was thrown into the sea and gathered _fish_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] of every kind,

###### v48
which when it was filled they pulled to shore and sat down _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("sat down") has been translated as a finite verb] collected the good _fish_ ^[Here the word "_fish_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] into containers, but the bad they threw out.

###### v49
Thus it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out and separate the evil from among the righteous

###### v50
and throw them into the fiery furnace. ^[An allusion to [[Dan-03#v6|Dan 3:6]]] In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!

###### v51
"Have you understood all these _things_?" They said to him, "Yes."

###### v52
And he said to them, "For this _reason_ every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of the house who brings out of his storeroom new _things_ and old _things_."

###### v53
And it happened that when Jesus had finished these parables he went away from there.

###### v54
And he came to his hometown _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came") has been translated as a finite verb] began to teach ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to teach")] them in their synagogue, so that they were amazed and said, "From where did this man _get_ this wisdom and these miracles?

###### v55
Is not this one the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?

###### v56
And are not all his sisters with us? From where then did this man _get_ all these _things_?"

###### v57
And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his _own_ hometown and in his _own_ household."

###### v58
And he did not perform many miracles in that place because of their unbelief.
