###### v1
Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,

###### v2
"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat _a meal_." ^[Literally "bread"]

###### v3
So he answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to them, "Why do you also break the commandment of God because of your tradition?

###### v4
For God said, 'Honor your ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] father and your ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] mother,' ^[A quotation from [[Exod-20#v12|Exod 20:12]]; [[Deut-05#v16|Deut 5:16]]] and 'The one who speaks evil of father or mother _must certainly die_ ^[Literally "let him die the death"].' ^[A quotation from [[Exod-21#v17|Exod 21:17]]; [[Lev-20#v9|Lev 20:9]]]

###### v5
But you say, 'Whoever says to his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] father or his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] mother, "Whatever _benefit you would have received_ ^[Literally "you would have been benefited"] from me _is_ a gift _to God_,"

###### v6
need not honor his father,' ^[Most later manuscripts add "or his mother"] and you make void the word of God for the sake of your tradition.

###### v7
Hypocrites! Isaiah correctly prophesied about you saying,

###### v8
'This people honors me with their ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] lips,
but their heart is far, far away from me,

###### v9
and they worship me in vain,
teaching _as_ doctrines the commandments of men.'" ^[A quotation from [[Isa-29#v13|Isa 29:13]]]

###### v10
And summoning the crowd, he said to them, "Hear and understand:

###### v11
It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth--this defiles a person."

###### v12
Then the disciples came _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard this saying?"

###### v13
And he answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.

###### v14
Let ^[Or "Depart from"] them! They are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit."

###### v15
But Peter answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, "Explain this parable to us."

###### v16
But he said, "Are you also still without understanding?

###### v17
Do you not understand that everything that enters into the mouth goes into the stomach and is evacuated into the latrine?

###### v18
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these defile the person.

###### v19
For from the heart come evil plans, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, abusive speech.

###### v20
These are the things that defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person!"

###### v21
And departing from there, Jesus went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon.

###### v22
And behold, a Canaanite woman from that district came _and_ cried out, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter _is_ severely possessed by a demon!"

###### v23
But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] asked him, saying, "Send her away, because she is crying out after us!"

###### v24
But he answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."

###### v25
But she came _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came") has been translated as a finite verb] knelt down before him, saying, "Lord, help me!"

###### v26
And he answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to the dogs!"

###### v27
So she said, "Yes, Lord, for even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table."

###### v28
Then Jesus answered _and_ said to her, "O woman, your faith _is_ great! Let it be done for you as you want." And her daughter was healed from that hour.

###### v29
And departing from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and he went up on the mountain _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went up") has been translated as a finite verb] was sitting there.

###### v30
And large crowds came to him, having with them _the_ mute, blind, lame, crippled, ^[Some manuscripts have "_the_ lame, blind, crippled, mute"] and many others, and they put them down at his feet, and he healed them.

###### v31
So then the crowd was astonished _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel.

###### v32
And Jesus summoned his disciples _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("summoned") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat, and I do not want to send them away hungry lest they give out on the way."

###### v33
And the disciples said to him, "Where in _this_ desolate place _can we get_ ^[Literally "for us"] so much bread that such a great crowd could be satisfied?"

###### v34
And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" So they said, "Seven, and a few little fish."

###### v35
And commanding the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground,

###### v36
he took the seven loaves and the fish and _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had given thanks") which is understood as temporal] had given thanks, he broke _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and began giving ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began giving")] _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to the disciples, and the disciples _gave them_ to the crowds.

###### v37
And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.

###### v38
Now those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children.

###### v39
And _after he_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had given thanks") which is understood as temporal] sent away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
