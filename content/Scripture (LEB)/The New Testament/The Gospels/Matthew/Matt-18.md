###### v1
At that time the disciples came up to Jesus, saying, "Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"

###### v2
And calling a child _to himself_, he had him stand in their midst

###### v3
and said, "Truly I say to you, unless you turn around and become like young children, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven!

###### v4
Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child, this person is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,

###### v5
and whoever welcomes one child such as this in my name welcomes me.

###### v6
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him that _a large millstone_ ^[Literally "a millstone of a donkey"] be hung on ^[Some manuscripts have "around"] his neck and he be drowned in the depths of the sea.

###### v7
Woe to the world because of causes for stumbling, for _it is_ a necessity _that_ causes for stumbling come; nevertheless, woe to the person through whom the cause for stumbling comes.

###### v8
And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] from you! It is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than, having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire!

###### v9
And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] from you! It is better for you to enter into life one-eyed than, having two eyes, to be thrown into fiery hell!

###### v10
"See to it that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven constantly see the face of my Father _who is_ in heaven. ^[Many later Greek manuscripts include vs. [[Matt-18#v11|11]], "For the Son of Man came to save those who are lost."]

###### v12
What do you think? If _a certain man has_ ^[Literally "there are to a certain man"] a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("go") has been translated as a finite verb] look for the one that wandered away?

###### v13
And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not wander away.

###### v14
In the _same_ way it is not the will _of_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] your Father _who is_ in heaven that one of these little ones perish.

###### v15
"Now if your brother sins against you, go correct him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.

###### v16
But if he does not listen, take with you in addition one or two _others_, so that by _the testimony_ ^[Literally "the mouth"] of two or three witnesses every matter may be established.

###### v17
And if he refuses to listen to them, tell _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to the church. But if he refuses to listen to the church also, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.

###### v18
"Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.

###### v19
Again, truly I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about any matter that they ask, it will be done for them from my Father _who is_ in heaven.

###### v20
For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there in the midst of them."

###### v21
Then Peter came up to him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] said, ^[Some manuscripts have "Then Peter came up _and_ said to him"] "Lord, how many times will my brother sin against me and I will forgive him? Up to seven times?"

###### v22
Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven! ^[Or "seventy-seven times"]

###### v23
"For this _reason_ the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man--a king--who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.

###### v24
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("began")] he began to settle _them_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] someone was brought to him who owed ten thousand talents.

###### v25
And _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as causal] he did not have _enough_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to repay _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] the master ordered him to be sold, and his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] wife and his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] children and everything that he had, and to be repaid.

###### v26
Then the slave threw himself to the ground _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("threw himself to the ground") has been translated as a finite verb] began to do obeisance to him, saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay back everything to you!'

###### v27
So the master of that slave, _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("had compassion") which is understood as causal] had compassion, released him and forgave him the loan.

###### v28
But that slave went out _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went out") has been translated as a finite verb] found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and taking hold of him, he began to choke _him_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] saying, 'Pay back everything that you owe!'

###### v29
Then his fellow slave threw himself to the ground _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("threw himself to the ground") has been translated as a finite verb] began to implore ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to implore")] him, saying, 'Be patient with me and I will repay you!'

###### v30
But he did not want to, but rather he went _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went") has been translated as a finite verb] threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed.

###### v31
So _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal] his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were extremely distressed, and went _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went") has been translated as a finite verb] reported to their master everything that had happened.

###### v32
Then his master summoned him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("summoned") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, 'Wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you implored me!

###### v33
Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I also showed mercy to you?'

###### v34
And _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was angry") which is understood as causal] was angry, his master handed him over to the merciless jailers ^[Or "torturers"] until he would repay everything that was owed.

###### v35
So also my heavenly Father will do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from your hearts!"
