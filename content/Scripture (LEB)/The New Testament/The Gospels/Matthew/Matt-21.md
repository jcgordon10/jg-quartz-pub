###### v13

###### v16
And they said to him, "Do you hear what these _children_ ^[The word "_children_" is not in the Greek text but is implied] are saying?"

###### v31
Which of the two did the will of _his_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the kingdom of God!

For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did believe him.

"Listen to another parable: There was a man--a master of a house--who planted a vineyard, and put a fence _around_ it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey.

###### v34
And when the season of fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the tenant farmers to collect his fruit.

Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the scriptures,
'The stone which the builders rejected,
this has become _the cornerstone_. ^[Literally "the head of the corner"]
This came about from the Lord,
and it is marvelous in our eyes'? ^[A quotation from [[Ps-118#v22|Ps 118:22–23]][[Ps-118#v23|]]]
