###### v1
And continuing, Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,

###### v2
"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man--a king--who gave a wedding celebration for his son.

###### v3
And he sent his slaves to summon those who had been invited to the wedding celebration, and they did not want to come.

###### v4
Again he sent other slaves, saying, 'Tell those who have been invited, "Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened _cattle_ have been slaughtered, and everything _is_ ready. Come to the wedding celebration!"'

###### v5
But they paid no attention _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("paid no attention") has been translated as a finite verb] went away--this one to his own field, that one to his business.

###### v6
And the others, seizing his slaves, mistreated _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and killed _them_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v7
And the king was angry and sent his troops _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("sent") has been translated as a finite verb] destroyed those murderers and burned their city.

###### v8
Then he said to his slaves, 'The wedding celebration is ready, but those who had been invited were not worthy.

###### v9
Therefore, go out to the _places where_ the roads exit the city and invite to the wedding celebration as many _people_ as you find.'

###### v10
And those slaves went out into the roads _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went out") has been translated as a finite verb] gathered everyone whom they found, both evil and good, and the wedding celebration was filled _with dinner guests_. ^[Literally "with those reclining at table"]

###### v11
But _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came in") which is understood as temporal] the king came in to see the _dinner guests_, ^[Literally "ones reclining at table"] he saw a man there not dressed _in_ wedding clothes.

###### v12
And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here, not having wedding clothes?' But _he could say nothing_. ^[Literally "he was silent"]

###### v13
Then the king said to the servants, 'Tie him up _hand and foot_ ^[Literally "feet and hands"] _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("tie") has been translated as a finite verb] throw him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!'

###### v14
For many are called but few _are_ chosen."

###### v15
Then the Pharisees went _and consulted_ ^[Literally "took counsel"] so that they could entrap him with a statement.

###### v16
And they sent their disciples to him with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and _you do not care what anyone thinks_, ^[Literally "it is not a care to you concerning anyone"] _because you do not regard the opinion of people_. ^[Literally "because you do not look at the face of men"]

###### v17
Therefore tell us what you think. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"

###### v18
But _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("knew") which is understood as causal] knew their maliciousness, Jesus said, "Hypocrites! Why are you testing me?

###### v19
Show me the coin for the tax!" So they brought him a denarius.

###### v20
And he said to them, "Whose image and inscription _is_ this?"

###### v21
They said to him, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Therefore give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!"

###### v22
And _when they_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] heard _this_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] they were astonished, and they left him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("left") has been translated as a finite verb] went away.

###### v23
On that day Sadducees--who say there is no resurrection--came up to him and asked him,

###### v24
saying, "Teacher, Moses said if someone dies without having children, his brother is to marry his wife and _father_ ^[Literally "raise up"] descendants for his brother.

###### v25
Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first died _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("getting married") which is understood as temporal] getting married, and _because he_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as causal] did not have descendants, he left his wife to his brother.

###### v26
So also the second and the third, up to the seventh.

###### v27
And last of all the woman died.

###### v28
In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her _as wife_." ^[*The words "_as wife_" are not in the Greek text but are implied]

###### v29
But Jesus answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to them, "You are mistaken, _because_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal] you do not know the scriptures or the power of God!

###### v30
For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God ^[Some manuscripts omit "of God"] in heaven.

###### v31
Now concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said,

###### v32
"I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob"? ^[A quotation from [[Exod-03#v6|Exod 3:6]]] He is not the God of the dead, but of the living!"

###### v33
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] the crowds heard _this_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] they were amazed at his teaching.

###### v34
Now _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("heard") which is understood as temporal] the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they assembled at the same _place_. ^[Or "they assembled together"]

###### v35
And one of them, a legal expert, put a question to _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to test him:

###### v36
"Teacher, which commandment _is_ greatest in the law?"

###### v37
And he said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' ^[A quotation from [[Deut-06#v5|Deut 6:5]]]

###### v38
This is the greatest and first commandment.

###### v39
And the second _is_ like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' ^[A quotation from [[Lev-19#v18|Lev 19:18]]]

###### v40
On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets."

###### v41
Now _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("assembled")] the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,

###### v42
saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "David's."

###### v43
He said to them, "How then does David, by the Spirit, call him 'Lord,' saying,

###### v44
'The Lord said to my Lord,
"Sit at my right hand
until I put your enemies
under your feet"'? ^[A quotation from [[Ps-110#v1|Ps 110:1]]]

###### v45
If then David calls him 'Lord,' how is he his son?"

###### v46
And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day _on_ to ask him any more _questions_. ^[*The word "_questions_" is not in the Greek text but is implied]
