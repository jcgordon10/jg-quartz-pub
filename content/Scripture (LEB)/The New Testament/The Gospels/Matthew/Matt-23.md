###### v3
Therefore do and observe everything that they tell you, but do not do as _they do_, ^[Literally "their deeds"] for they tell _others to do something_ ^[The words "_others to do something_" are not in the Greek text but are implied] and do not do _it themselves_. ^[*The words "_it themselves_" are not in the Greek text but are implied]

###### v4
And they tie up heavy burdens ^[Some manuscripts have "burdens that are heavy and hard to bear"] and put _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] on people's shoulders, but _they_ themselves are not willing with their finger to move them.

"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees--hypocrites!--because you shut the kingdom of heaven before people!

###### v15
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees--hypocrites!--because you travel around the sea and the dry _land_ to make one convert, and when he becomes _one_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] you make him twice as much a son of hell _as_ you _are_!

###### v16

###### v23
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees--hypocrites!--because you pay a tenth of mint and dill and cumin, and neglect the more important _matters_ of the law--justice and mercy and faithfulness! It was necessary ^[Some manuscripts have "But it was necessary"] to do these _things_ _while not neglecting those_. ^[Literally "and those not to neglect"]

###### v24
Blind guides who filter out a gnat and swallow a camel!

###### v25
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees--hypocrites!--because you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence!

And you--fill up the measure of your fathers!

###### v33
Serpents! Offspring of vipers! How will you escape from the condemnation to hell?

###### v34
For this _reason_, behold, I am sending to you prophets and wise men and scribes. _Some_ of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and will pursue from town to town,

###### v35
so that upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of righteous Abel up to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.

How many times I wanted to gather your children together _the way_ ^[Literally "in the manner in which"] a hen gathers her young together under _her_ ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] wings, and you were not willing!

###### v38
