###### v1
"Then the kingdom of heaven may be compared to ten virgins who took their lamps _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("took") has been translated as a finite verb] went out to meet the bridegroom.

###### v2
Now five of them were foolish and five _were_ wise.

###### v3
For _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("took") which is understood as temporal] the foolish ones took their lamps, they did not take olive oil with them.

###### v4
But the wise ones took olive oil in flasks with their lamps.

###### v5
And _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was delayed")] the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to sleep", "fell asleep")]

###### v6
But in the middle of the night there was a shout, 'Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'

###### v7
Then all those virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.

###### v8
And the foolish ones said to the wise ones, 'Give us _some_ of your olive oil, because our lamps are going out!'

###### v9
But the wise ones answered saying, "Certainly there will never be enough for us and for you! Go instead to those who sell _olive oil_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and buy _some_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] for yourselves.'

###### v10
But _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("had gone away")] they had gone away to buy _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] the bridegroom arrived, and those who were ready went inside with him to the wedding celebration, and the door was shut.

###### v11
And later the other virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, lord, open _the door_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] for us!'

###### v12
But he answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you!'

###### v13
Therefore be on the alert, because you do not know the day or the hour!

###### v14
For _it is_ like a man going on a journey. He summoned his own slaves and handed over his property to them.

###### v15
And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each one according to his own ability, and he went on a journey immediately.

###### v16
The one who had received the five talents went out _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went out") has been translated as a finite verb] traded with them and gained five more.

###### v17
In the same way the one _who had_ the two gained two more.

###### v18
But the one who had received the one went away _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went away") has been translated as a finite verb] dug up the ground and hid his master's money.

###### v19
Now after a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.

###### v20
And the one who had received the five talents came up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] brought five more talents, saying, 'Master, you handed over to me five talents. See, I have gained five more talents!'

###### v21
His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few _things_; I will put you _in charge_ over many _things_. Enter into the joy of your master!'

###### v22
And the one _who had_ the two talents also came up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] said, 'Master, you handed over to me two talents. See, I have gained two talents more!'

###### v23
His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few _things_; I will put you _in charge_ over many _things_. Enter into the joy of your master!'

###### v24
And the one who had received the one talent came up also _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] said, 'Master, _because I_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("knew") which is understood as causal] knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering from where you did not scatter _seed_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v25
And _because I_ ^[Here "_because_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was afraid") which is understood as causal] was afraid, I went away _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went away") has been translated as a finite verb] hid your talent in the ground. See, you have _what is_ yours!'

###### v26
But his master answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, 'Evil and lazy slave! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather from where I did not scatter _seed_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v27
Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and _when I_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("returned") which is understood as temporal] returned I would have gotten back _what was_ mine with interest!

###### v28
Therefore take the talent from him and give _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to the one who has the ten talents.

###### v29
For to everyone who has, _more_ will be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.

###### v30
And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness--in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!'

###### v31
Now when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.

###### v32
And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them from one another like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

###### v33
And he will place the sheep on his right and the goats on the left.

###### v34
Then the king will say to those on his right, 'Come, _you_ who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world!

###### v35
For I was hungry and you gave me _something_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me _something_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me as a guest,

###### v36
I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you cared for me, I was in prison and you came to me.'

###### v37
Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed _you_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] or thirsty and give _you something_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to drink?

###### v38

###### v39
And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?'

And the king will answer _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("will answer") has been translated as a finite verb] say to them, 'Truly I say to you, in as much as you did _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to me.'

###### v41
Then he will also say to those on _his_ left, 'Depart from me, _you_ accursed ones, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels!

###### v42
For I was hungry and you did not give me _anything_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to eat, I was thirsty and you did not give me _anything_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to drink,

###### v43

###### v46
