For _when_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("poured") which is understood as temporal] this woman poured this ointment on my body, she did _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] in order to prepare me for burial.

Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests

###### v15
_and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the participle in the previous verse ("went") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "What are you willing to give me if I in turn deliver him to you?" So they set out for him thirty silver coins.

###### v16
And from that time on, he began seeking a favorable opportunity in order that he could betray him.

###### v17

And he answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "The one who dips his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hand in the bowl with me--this one will betray me.

He said to him, "You have said _it_." ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v26
Now _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("were eating")] they were eating Jesus took bread and, _after_ ^[Here "_after_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("giving thanks") which is understood as temporal] giving thanks, he broke _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and giving _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to the disciples, he said, "Take, eat, this is my body."

###### v31
Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me during this night, for it is written,
'I will strike the shepherd
and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' ^[A quotation from [[Zech-13#v7|Zech 13:7]]]

###### v32
But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."

###### v34
Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you that during this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times!"

###### v35
Peter said to him, "Even if it is necessary for me to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the disciples said the same _thing_.

###### v36
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go over there _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("go") has been translated as a finite verb] pray."

###### v37
And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be distressed and troubled.

###### v38
Then he said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me."

###### v39
And going forward a little he fell down on his face, praying and saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you _will_." ^[*Here the verb "_will_" is an understood repetition of the verb earlier in this verse]

###### v40
And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "So, were you not able to stay awake with me one hour?

###### v41
Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit _is_ willing, but the flesh _is_ weak!"

###### v42
Again for the second time he went away _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went away") has been translated as a finite verb] prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will must be done."

###### v43
And he came again _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came again") has been translated as a finite verb] found them sleeping, _for they could not keep their eyes open_. ^[Literally "for their eyes were weighed down"]

###### v44
And leaving them again, he went away _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went away") has been translated as a finite verb] prayed for the third _time_, saying the same thing again.

###### v45
Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.

###### v46
Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!"

###### v47
And _while_ ^[Here "_while_" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("was … speaking")] he was still speaking, behold, Judas--one of the twelve--arrived, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

###### v48
Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, "_The one_ whom I kiss--he is _the one_. ^[*Here the predicate nominative ("_the one_") is implied] Arrest him!"

###### v49
And he came up to Jesus immediately _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "Greetings, Rabbi," and kissed him.

###### v50
And Jesus said to him, "Friend, _do that_ ^[The words "_do that_" are not in the Greek text but are implied] for which you have come." ^[The meaning of this phrase is disputed: (1) some take it as a declarative (as in the translation); (2) others understand it as some form of a question, often with supplied words: (a) "Friend, _are you misusing the kiss_ for that _purpose_ for which you are here?" (b) "Friend, in connection with that for which you have appeared _do you kiss me_?" (c) "Friend, are you here for this purpose?" (d) "Friend, what are you here for?"; this last option, though often suggested, is doubtful because of lack of evidence for the relative pronoun used as an interrogative in direct questions] Then they came up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.

###### v51
And behold, one of those with Jesus extended his ^[Literally "the"; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun] hand _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("extended") has been translated as a finite verb] drew his sword, and striking the slave of the high priest, cut off his ear.

###### v52
Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place! For all who take up the sword will die by the sword.

###### v53
Or do you think that I cannot call upon my Father, and he would put at my disposal at once more than twelve legions of angels?

###### v54
How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen in this way?"

###### v55
At that time Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to arrest me? Every day in the temple _courts_ ^[Here "_courts_" is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself] I sat teaching, and you did not arrest me!

###### v56
But all this has happened in order that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled." Then the disciples all abandoned him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("abandoned") has been translated as a finite verb] fled.

###### v57
Now those who had arrested Jesus led _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.

###### v58
But Peter was following him from a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And he went inside _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went") has been translated as a finite verb] was sitting with the officers to see the outcome.

###### v59
Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order that they could put him to death.

###### v60
And they did not find _it_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] _although_ ^[Here "_although_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came forward") which is understood as concessive] many false witnesses came forward. And finally two came forward

###### v61
_and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the participle in the previous verse ("came forward") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] within three days.'"

###### v62
And the high priest stood up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("stood up") has been translated as a finite verb] said to him, "Do you reply nothing? What are these _people_ testifying against you?"

###### v63
But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, "I put you under oath by the living God, that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!"

###### v64
Jesus said to him, "You have said _it_. ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] But I tell you, from now _on_ you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power ^[An indirect way of referring to God] and coming on the clouds of heaven."

###### v65
Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have just now heard the blasphemy!

###### v66
What do you think?" And they answered _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "_He deserves death_!" ^[Literally "he is deserving of death"]

###### v67
Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists, and they slapped _him_, ^[*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v68
saying, "Prophesy for us, _you_ Christ! Who is it who hit you?"

###### v69
Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a female slave came up to him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."

###### v70
But he denied _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] in the presence of _them_ all, saying, "I do not know what you mean!"

###### v71
And _when he_ ^[Here "_when_" is supplied as a component of the participle ("went out") which is understood as temporal] went out to the gateway, another _female slave_ ^[The words "_female slave_" are not in the Greek text but are implied by the feminine singular form] saw him and said to those _who were_ there, "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."

###### v72
And again he denied _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] with an oath, "I do not know the man!"

###### v73
And after a little _while_ those who were standing there came up _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("came up") has been translated as a finite verb] said to Peter, "You really are _one_ of them also, because even your accent _reveals who you are_." ^[Literally "makes you evident"]

###### v74
Then he began to curse and to swear with an oath, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.

###### v75
And Peter remembered the statement Jesus had said, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times," and he went outside _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("went") has been translated as a finite verb] wept bitterly.
