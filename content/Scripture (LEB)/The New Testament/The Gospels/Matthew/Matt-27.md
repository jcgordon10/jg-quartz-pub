###### v30
And they spat on him _and_ ^[Here "_and_" is supplied because the previous participle ("spat") has been translated as a finite verb] took the reed and repeatedly struck ^[The imperfect tense has been translated as iterative here ("repeatedly struck")] _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] on his head.
