[[Eccl-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
The words of the Teacher, ^[Hebrew "Qohelet"] the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

###### v2
"Vanity of vanities!" says the Teacher, ^[Hebrew "Qohelet"]
"Vanity of vanities! All _is_ vanity!"

###### v3
What does a person gain in all his toil
with which he toils under the sun?

###### v4
A generation goes, and a generation comes,
but the earth stands forever.

###### v5
The sun rises, and the sun goes down;
to its place it hurries, ^[The MT reads "_it_ gasps _for breath_," which is supported by LXX "to draw _breath_"; the BHS editors suggest "_it_ returns again"] and there it rises again.

###### v6
The wind goes to the south and goes around to the north;
around and around it goes, and on its circuit the wind returns.

###### v7
All the streams flow to the sea,
but the sea is never full;
to the place where the streams flow,
there they continue to flow.

###### v8
All things toil continuously; ^[Or "are wearisome"]
no one can ever finish describing this. ^[The MT reads "no one is able to speak." The BHS editors suggest "no one can finish speaking." On the basis of internal evidence, the latter is adopted in the translation, since it makes better sense in the light of the immediate context]
The eye is never ^[Or "not"] satisfied with seeing,
and the ear is never ^[Or "not"] filled with hearing.

###### v9
What has been--it is what will be;
what has been done--it is what will be done;
there is nothing new under the sun.

###### v10
There is a thing _of_ which it is said, "Look at this! This is new!"
_But_ it already existed in ages past before us.

###### v11
There is neither remembrance of former generations,
nor will there be remembrance of future generations.

###### v12
I, the Teacher, ^[Hebrew "Qohelet"] _was_ king over Israel in Jerusalem.

###### v13
I applied my mind to seek and to search by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. ^[MT reads "under the heavens," which is supported by LXX; however, several versions (Syriac Peshitta, Aramaic Targum, Latin Vulgate) as well as the Cairo Geniza manuscript read, "under the sun," cf. 1:3, 9, etc.] It _is_ a grievous task God has given to _humans_. ^[Literally "the sons of the man"]

###### v14
I saw all the works that are done under the sun. Look! Everything _is_ vanity and chasing wind.

###### v15
What is twisted cannot be straightened, ^[The MT reads the active "to be straight"; however, the BHS editors suggest the passive "to be straightened," which is supported by LXX, which reflects a passive form]
and what is lacking cannot be counted. ^[The MT reads "to be numbered"; however, the BHS editors suggest "to be supplied," comparing 1:15b with similar wording in the Babylonian Talmud: "May the Almighty replenish your loss" (_b. Berachot_ 16b)]

###### v16
_I said to myself_, ^[Literally "I myself said to my heart"] "Look! I have become great and have increased _in_ wisdom more than anyone who _has preceded_ ^[Literally "before me"] me over Jerusalem. _I have acquired a great deal of wisdom and knowledge_." ^[Literally "And my mind has seen much wisdom and knowledge"]

###### v17
So _I dedicated myself_ ^[Literally "[[Song-01|So I]] gave my heart"] to learn about wisdom and _to_ learn about delusion and folly. However, I discovered ^[Or "I knew"] that this also _is_ chasing wind.

###### v18
For in much wisdom _is_ much frustration, ^[Or "vexation"]
and whoever increases knowledge increases sorrow.
