###### v1
I said _to myself_, ^[Literally "to my heart"] "Come! I will test ^[The MT reads "I will test you," but the BHS editors propose "I will test …" Whether or not one adopts MT, Qohelet is speaking to himself] pleasure _to see whether it is worthwhile_." ^[Literally "and look at goodness"; this idiom refers to the enjoyment of life] But look, "This also _is_ vanity!"

###### v2
I said of laughter, "_It is_ folly!" and of pleasure, "_What does it accomplish?_" ^[Literally "What does it give?"]

###### v3
I also _explored_ ^[Literally "I searched in my mind"] _the effects of indulging my flesh_ ^[Literally "to cheer my flesh"] with wine. My mind guiding me with wisdom, _I investigated_ ^[Literally "laid hold of"] folly so that I might discover what _is_ good under heaven ^[Follows MT; two medieval Hebrew manuscripts, LXX, Peshitta read, "under the sun," cf. 1:3, 9, etc.] for _humans_ ^[Literally "the sons of the man"] to do _during the days of their lives_. ^[Literally "the number of the days of their lives"]

###### v4
_I accomplished great things_. ^[Literally "I made great my works"] I built for myself houses; I planted for myself vineyards.

###### v5
I made for myself gardens and parks, and I planted all _sorts of_ fruit trees in them.

###### v6
I made for myself pools of water from which to irrigate a grove of flourishing trees.

###### v7
I acquired male slaves and female slaves, as well as children _born in my_ house. I also had livestock, cattle, and flocks more than anyone who _was_ before me in Jerusalem.

###### v8
I also gathered to myself silver and gold--the royal and provincial treasuries. I acquired for myself male and female singers, as well as the delight of _men_, ^[Literally "the sons of the man"] _voluptuous concubines_. ^[Literally "a breast and breasts," as a synecdoche for beautiful women in the king's harem]

###### v9
Thus, _I accomplished far more_ ^[Literally "I became great and I surpassed"] than anyone who _was_ before me in Jerusalem--indeed, my wisdom stood by me.

###### v10
I neither withheld anything from my eyes that they desired, nor did I deprive any pleasure from my heart. My heart rejoiced in all my toil, for this was my reward from all my toil.

###### v11
Yet when I considered ^[Or "turned to"] all the effort which I expended and the toil with which I toiled to do, then behold, "Everything _is_ vanity and chasing wind! There is nothing profitable under the sun!"

###### v12
Next, I considered wisdom, as well as delusion and folly. What can anyone _do_ who will come after the king that has not already been done?

###### v13
I realized that wisdom has an advantage over folly, just as light has an advantage over darkness.

###### v14
_The wise man can see where he is walking_, ^[Literally "The eyes of the wise _are_ in his head"] but the fool walks in darkness. Yet I also realized that both of them suffer the same fate.

###### v15
So I said _to myself_, ^[Literally "in my heart"] "_If I also suffer the same fate as the fool_, ^[Literally "Just as the fate of the fool--so it will happen to me!"] _what advantage is my great wisdom_?" ^[Literally "why have I been so exceedingly wise?"] So I said _to myself_, ^[Literally "in my heart"] "This also _is_ vanity!"

###### v16
Certainly no one will remember the wise man or the fool in _future generations_. ^[Literally "the futures"] When _future_ days come, both will have been forgotten already. How _is it that_ the wise man dies the same as the fool?

###### v17
So I hated life because the work done under the sun _is_ grievous to me. For everything _is_ vanity and chasing wind!

###### v18
So I hated all my toil with which I have toiled under the sun, for I must leave it behind to someone who will be after me.

###### v19
And who knows _whether_ he will be wise or foolish? Yet he will exercise control of all _the fruit of_ my toil with which I toiled wisely under the sun. This also _is_ vanity!

###### v20
So _I began to despair_ ^[Literally "I myself turned to cause my heart to despair"] of all the toil with which I toiled under the sun.

###### v21
For although a person may toil with great wisdom and skill, he must leave his reward to someone who has not toiled for it. This also _is_ vanity and a great calamity.

###### v22
For what does a person receive for all his toil and in the longing of his heart with which he toils under the sun?

###### v23
All his days _are_ painful, his labor _brings_ grief, and his heart cannot rest at night. This also _is_ vanity!

###### v24
There is nothing better for a person than to eat and drink and _find delight_ ^[Literally "to see good"] in his toil. For I also realized that this _is_ from the hand of God!

###### v25
For who can eat _and drink_, and who can enjoy _life_ apart from him? ^[The MT reads "more than me," which is supported by Aramaic Targum and Latin Vulgate, but several medieval Hebrew manuscripts read "from him"]

###### v26
For to the person who _is_ good in his eyes, he gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and heaping up only to give _it_ to _him who is_ pleasing to him. This also _is_ vanity and chasing wind!
