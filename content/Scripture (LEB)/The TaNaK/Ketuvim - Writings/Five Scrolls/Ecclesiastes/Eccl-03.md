###### v1
For everything there _is_ an appointed time, a time for every matter under heaven:

###### v2
a time to bear ^[Or "a time to be born"; MT reads the active form "to bear _children_"] and a time to die;
a time to plant and a time to root up _what is_ planted;

###### v3
a time to kill and a time to heal;
a time to break down and a time to build up;

###### v4
a time to weep and a time to laugh;
a time to mourn and a time to dance;

###### v5
a time to throw away stones and a time to gather stones;
a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;

###### v6
a time to seek and a time to lose;
a time to keep and a time to throw away;

###### v7
a time to tear and a time to sew;
a time to be silent and a time to speak;

###### v8
a time to love and a time to hate;
a time _for_ war and a time _for_ peace.

###### v9
What does the worker gain in his toil?

###### v10
I have seen the busyness God gives to _humans_ ^[Literally "the sons of the man"] to preoccupy ^[Or "to be busy"] them.

###### v11
He has made everything suitable in its time. He also has put _the past_ ^[Literally "eternity"] in their hearts, yet no one can grasp what God does from the beginning to the end.

###### v12
So I realized that there is _nothing better_ ^[Literally "no good"] for them than to _rejoice and enjoy themselves_ ^[Literally "to rejoice and to do good"] during their lives.

###### v13
And for anyone to eat and drink, that is, _to enjoy the fruit of all his toil_, ^[Literally "to see good in all his toil"] this also is a gift of God.

###### v14
I know everything God does endures forever;
nothing can be added to it, and nothing can be taken from it,
for God so acts that humans ^[Or "they"] might stand in awe before him.

###### v15
What is--it already was,
and what will be--it already is,
for _God will do what he has done._ ^[Literally "God seeks _what_ is pursued"]

###### v16
I saw something else under the sun: instead of justice _there was_ evil; instead of righteousness _there was_ wickedness.

###### v17
So I said _to myself_, ^[Literally "in my heart"] "God will surely judge the righteous and the wicked, for he has appointed ^[The MT reads שָׁם "there," but repointing to שָׂם, "he has appointed," makes better sense] a time _of judgment_ for every deed and every work."

###### v18
I said to myself concerning _humans_, ^[Literally "the sons of the man"] "God sifts ^[Or "tests"] them in order to show ^[The MT reads active "to see," but causative "to show" is reflected by LXX, Syriac Peshitta, and Latin Vulgate] them that they are like beasts."

###### v19
For the fate of _humans_ ^[Literally "the sons of the man"] and the fate of the beast is _the same_. ^[Literally "_is_ one"] The death of the one is like the death of the other, for _both are mortal_. ^[Literally "and one breath _is_ for all"] Man has no advantage over the beast, for both are fleeting.

###### v20
Both go to one place--both came from dust and both return to dust.

###### v21
For no one knows _whether_ the spirit of a human ascends _to heaven_ and _whether_ the spirit of the beast descends to the ground!

###### v22
So I concluded that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy _the fruit of_ his labor, for this is his lot in life. _For no one knows what will happen in the future._ ^[Literally "For who can bring him to see in what will be after him?"]
