###### v1
I looked again, and I saw all the oppression that occurs under the sun.
_I saw the tears of the oppressed--_
_no one comforts them!_
_Those who oppress them are powerful--_
_no one can comfort them_! ^[Literally "And look! The tears of the oppressed, and there is no comforting for them, and from the hand of oppressors _of_ them _was_ power, and there is no comforting for them"]

###### v2
So I deemed the dead who have already died
more _fortunate_ than the living who are still alive.

###### v3
But better _off_ than both of them is the one who has not yet been born
and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.

###### v4
I also realized that all _of the_ toil and all _of_ the skillful work that is done--it _is_ envy between one man and _another_. ^[Literally "his friend"] This also _is_ vanity and chasing wind!

###### v5
_The fool refuses to work with his hands,_
_so he has nothing to eat except his own skin_! ^[Literally "The fool folds his hands and eats his flesh"]

###### v6
Better _is_ one handful with peace
than two fists full with toil and chasing wind.

###### v7
I turned again and saw another vanity under the sun.

###### v8
Sometimes a man is all alone with no companion; he also has neither son nor brother. Yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eye is not satisfied with wealth. _He laments,_ "For whom am I toiling and depriving _myself_ ^[Literally "his soul"] of pleasure?" This also _is_ vanity--it is an unhappy business!

###### v9
Two _are_ better than the one, for they enjoy a better reward for their toil.

###### v10
For if one falls, his companion may help him up. But pity the one who falls and there is _no one_ ^[Literally "there is not a second"] to help him up.

###### v11
Also if two lie together, _they can keep each other warm_. ^[Literally "and it will be warm for them"] But how can one person be warm?

###### v12
_Although an assailant may overpower one person, two may withstand him_. ^[Literally "And even though he will prevail against him, the one; the second, they will withstand opposite him"] A threefold cord _is not easily broken_! ^[Literally "will not be broken in haste"]

###### v13
A poor but wise youth _is_ better than an old but foolish king who no longer knows _how to receive advice_. ^[Literally "how to be warned"]

###### v14
For he came out of the prison house to reign, _since he was born poor in his kingdom_. ^[Literally "for all in his kingdom he was born poor"]

###### v15
I saw all the living who move about under the sun with the youth; the second who will stand in his place.

###### v16
There is no end to all the people, to all who were before him. Yet the later generation will not rejoice in him, for this also _is_ vanity and chasing wind!
