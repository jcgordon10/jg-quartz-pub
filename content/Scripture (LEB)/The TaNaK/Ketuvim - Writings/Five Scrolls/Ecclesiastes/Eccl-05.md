###### v1
 ^[[[Eccl-05|Ecclesiastes 5:1–20]] in the English Bible is 4:17–5:19 in the Hebrew Bible] Guard your steps when you go to the house of God;
draw near to listen _rather_ than to offer a sacrifice of fools,
for they do not know that they are doing evil.

###### v2
Do not be rash with your mouth,
and do not let your heart be quick to utter a word before God.
For God is in heaven, and you _are_ on earth;
therefore, let your words be few.

###### v3
For a dream comes with many cares,
and the voice of a fool with many words.

###### v4
When you make a vow to God,
do not delay in fulfilling it,
for _he takes no pleasure_ ^[Literally "there is no desire"] in fools.
Fulfill what you vow!

###### v5
It is better that you not vow
than that you vow and not fulfill it.

###### v6
Do not let your mouth lead your flesh into sin,
and do not tell the messenger that it _was_ a mistake.
Why anger God at your words,
so that he destroys the work of your hands?

###### v7
For with many dreams _come_ vanities and numerous words.
Therefore, fear God!

###### v8
Do not be surprised if you see the poor being oppressed with violence
or _do not see_ justice and righteousness in the province.
For one official is watched by a higher official,
and _there are_ even higher officials over them!

###### v9
The produce of the land is exploited by everyone;
_even the king profits from the field _of the poor__! ^[Literally "for the field is even worked for the king"]

###### v10
Whoever loves money is not satisfied _with_ money,
and whoever loves wealth _is_ not _satisfied with_ profit.
This also _is_ vanity!

###### v11
When prosperity increases,
those who consume it increase.
_So its owner gains nothing,_
_except to see his wealth before it is spent_. ^[Literally "And what gain has its owner but to see it with his eyes?"]

###### v12
The sleep of the laborer _is_ pleasant, whether he eats little or much,
but the wealth of the rich man does not allow him to rest.

###### v13
There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth _hoarded_ ^[Literally "kept "] by its owner to his harm.

###### v14
That wealth was lost in a bad venture. Although he has borne a child, _he has nothing to leave to him_. ^[Literally "he has nothing in his hand"]

###### v15
Just as he came from his mother's womb naked, _he will depart_ ^[Literally "return to go"] just as he came; he will take nothing with him for his toil.

###### v16
This also _is_ a grievous illness. Exactly as he came, so he will go. What profit _does_ he gain for all his toil for the wind?

###### v17
Also, he eats in darkness all his days; he is frustrated _in_ much sickness and resentment.

###### v18
Look! I have discovered what is good and fitting: to eat and to drink and _to enjoy_ ^[Literally "to see goodness"] all _the fruit of_ the toil with which one toils under the sun during the number of the days of his life that God gives to him--for this _is_ his lot. ^[Or "fate"]

###### v19
This indeed is a gift of God: everyone to whom God gives wealth and possessions, he also empowers him _to enjoy them_, ^[Literally "to eat from it"] to accept his lot, and to rejoice in _the fruit of_ his toil.

###### v20
For he does not remember the _brief_ days of his life, for God keeps his heart preoccupied with enjoyment _of life_.
