###### v1
Here is another misfortune that I have seen under the sun, and it _is_ prevalent among humankind.

###### v2
God gives a man wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires; yet God does not enable him to enjoy it--instead someone else ends up enjoying it. This _is_ vanity--indeed, it _is_ a grievous ill!

###### v3
Even if a man fathers a hundred _children_ and lives many years so that the days of his years are many, if his heart ^[Or "his soul"] is not satisfied with _his prosperity_ ^[Literally "the good"] and _he does not receive a proper burial_, ^[Literally "and also there is no burial for him"] I deem the stillborn better than him.

###### v4
For he comes into vanity and departs into darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness.

###### v5
He has neither seen nor known the sun, yet he has more rest than him.

###### v6
Even if a man ^[Hebrew "he"] lives a thousand years twice, if he ^[Hebrew "and"] does not enjoy _prosperity_, ^[Literally "good"] _both suffer the same fate_! ^[Literally "are not the all going to the same place?"]

###### v7
All of a man's toil _is_ for his mouth--
yet his appetite is never satisfied.

###### v8
So do the wise _really_ have an advantage over fools?
_Can the poor _really_ gain anything by knowing how to act in front of others_? ^[Literally "What _is there_ for the poor knowing _how_ to conduct themselves before the living?"]

###### v9
_Better to be content with what your eyes see_
_than for your soul to constantly crave more_. ^[Literally "Sight of the eyes _is_ better than wandering of desire"]
This also _is_ vanity and chasing wind!

###### v10
Whatever is--it was already determined,
_what will be--it has already been decided_. ^[Literally "and his name is known what he _is_ man"]
As for man, he cannot argue
against what is more powerful than him.

###### v11
_Increasing words only multiplies futility_, ^[Literally "_Where_ there _are_ numerous words, _it_ makes numerous vanity"]
how does that profit anyone?

###### v12
For who knows what _is_ good for a man in his life during the few days of his fleeting life, which are fleeting as a shadow? For who can tell anyone what will happen _in the future_ ^[Literally "after him"] under the sun?
