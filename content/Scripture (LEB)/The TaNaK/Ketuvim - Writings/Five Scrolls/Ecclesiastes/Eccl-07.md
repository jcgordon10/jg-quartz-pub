[[Eccl-06|Previous Chapter]] | [[Eccl-08|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
A good name _is_ better than precious ointment,
and the day of death _is better_ than the day of one's birth.

###### v2
Better to go to the house of mourning
than to go to the house of feasting,
for _death is_ the end of every person,
and the living should take _it_ to his heart.

###### v3
Sorrow _is_ better than laughter,
for by sadness of countenance the heart is made good.

###### v4
The heart of the wise _is_ in the house of mourning,
but the heart of fools _is_ in the house of mirth.

###### v5
Better to listen to _the_ rebuke of _the_ wise
than for a man to listen to _the_ song of fools.

###### v6
Like the sound of thorns under a pot,
so also the laughter of fools.
This also _is_ vanity!

###### v7
Surely oppression makes a fool of the wise,
and a bribe corrupts the heart.

###### v8
The end of a matter _is_ better than its beginning;
_better to be slow to anger than hot-headed_. ^[Literally "_one who is_ long of spirit _is_ better than _one who is_ high of spirit"]

###### v9
Do not be quick in your spirit to anger,
for anger lodges in the bosom of fools.

###### v10
Do not say, "Why were the former days better than these?"
For _it is_ not from wisdom _that_ you ask this.

###### v11
Wisdom _is_ good with an inheritance;
_it benefits the living_. ^[Literally "to those who see the sun"]

###### v12
_For wisdom offers protection like money offers protection_. ^[Literally "For in the shade of wisdom _is_ the shade of money"]
But knowledge _has_ an advantage--wisdom restores life to its possessor.

###### v13
Consider the work of God.
For who is able to make straight what he made crooked?

###### v14
In the day of prosperity, rejoice!
But in the day of adversity, consider!
For God made one in place of another
so that mortals cannot find out what will happen _in the future_. ^[Literally "after him"]

###### v15
I have seen all these things in my vain life:
Sometimes a righteous man perishes in _spite of_ his righteousness,
and sometimes a wicked man lives a long life in _spite of_ his evil.

###### v16
Do not be excessively ^[Or "abundantly"] righteous,
and do not act excessively wise, lest you destroy yourself.

###### v17
Do not act excessively wicked,
and do not be a fool, lest you die before your time.

###### v18
_It is_ good to take hold of the one and also must not let go of the other;
for whoever fears God will hold both of them secure.

###### v19
Wisdom gives more strength to the wise
than ten rulers who are in the city.

###### v20
Surely there is no one righteous on the earth
who _continually_ does good and never sins.

###### v21
Do not pay attention to everything people say,
lest you hear your own servant curse you.

###### v22
For your heart knows
that you also have cursed others many times.

###### v23
All this I have tested with wisdom. I said, "I will be wise!" but _it was beyond my grasp_. ^[Literally "it _was_ far from me"]

###### v24
_Whatever is--it is far beyond comprehension_. ^[Literally "That which is--it _is_ far and deep deep"] Who can discover it?

###### v25
I set my mind to try to seek wisdom and the plan, and to know that wickedness _is_ foolishness and that folly _is_ delusion.

###### v26
I myself found _that_ more bitter than death _is_ the woman who _is_ a trap, whose heart _is_ a snare, and whose hands _are_ bonds. The one who pleases God escapes from her, but the sinner is caught by her.

###### v27
"Look! I found this," said the Teacher, ^[Hebrew "Qohelet"] "while trying to find how the plan fits together.

###### v28
What my heart sought, I did not find. Although I found one righteous man among one thousand, I did not find one _upright_ woman among all these.

###### v29
Look! This alone I found: God made mankind upright, but they have devised many schemes."
