[[Eccl-07|Previous Chapter]] | [[Eccl-09|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Who _is_ like the sage?
Who knows _the_ interpretation of a thing?
A man's wisdom makes his face shine,
and the hardness of his face is changed.

###### v2
Keep _the_ command of _the_ king ^[While MT reads "I _said_, 'Keep _the_ mouth of _the_ king,'" the versions read "Keep _the_ mouth of _the_ king," which is adopted in the translation]
_because of your oath to God_. ^[Literally "because of the oath of God"]

###### v3
Do not be terrified of his presence!
Go at once and do not delay when a matter _is_ unpleasant,
for he can do anything that he desires.

###### v4
Since the word of the king _is_ supreme,
no one can say to him, "What are you doing?"

###### v5
Whoever obeys _his_ command will not suffer disaster.
The wise mind knows the _proper_ time and the right _procedure_.

###### v6
For there is a _proper_ time and right _procedure_ for every matter,
even though the trouble of man _weighs_ heavy upon him.

###### v7
Surely no one knows what will be,
so who can tell anyone what will happen?

###### v8
Just as no one can control the wind to restrain the wind,
so also no one can control the day of his death.
Just as no one is discharged in time of war,
so wickedness will not deliver the wicked.

###### v9
I saw all this as I applied my heart to all the deeds done under the sun: _sometimes those in authority harm others_. ^[Literally "sometimes one man domineers another man to his harm"]

###### v10
Meanwhile, I saw the wicked being _honorably_ buried, but those who came and went from the holy place were forgotten in the city, even though they had done so. This also _is_ vanity!

###### v11
Because sentence against an evil deed is not carried out quickly, the heart of _humans_ ^[Literally "the sons of the man"] fills up within them to do evil.

###### v12
Although the sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I also know that it will be good for those who fear God--because they fear _his presence_. ^[Literally "from before his face"]

###### v13
But it will not go well with the wicked, and they will not prolong _their_ days, like the shadow; because there is no fearing _God's presence_. ^[Literally "from before the face of God"]

###### v14
There _is_ a vanity that happens on earth: sometimes the righteous suffer what the wicked deserve, and sometimes the wicked receive what the righteous deserve. I said, "This also _is_ vanity!"

###### v15
So I recommend enjoyment. For there _is_ nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and to drink and to rejoice. This will accompany him in his toil the days of his life that God gives to him under the sun.

###### v16
I applied my mind to know wisdom and to understand the business that is done on earth--how neither day nor night one's eyes see sleep.

###### v17
Then I saw all the work of God--man _is_ not able to discover the work that is done under the sun. Although man may toil in seeking, he cannot find it. Even if a wise man claims _that he_ knows it, he cannot find it.
