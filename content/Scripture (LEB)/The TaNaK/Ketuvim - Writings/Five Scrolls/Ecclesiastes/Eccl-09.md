###### v1
So all this I laid to my heart, and I concluded ^[Or "examined"] that the righteous and the wise, as well as their deeds, _are_ in the hand of God. So no one knows anything that will _come_ to them, whether _it will be_ love or hatred.

###### v2
The same fate _comes_ to everyone:
to the righteous and to the wicked,
to the good and to the wicked, ^[Several versions (Greek, Syriac, Latin) insert "and to the bad"]
to the clean and to the unclean,
to those who sacrifice and to those who do not sacrifice.
As _with_ the good _man_, so also to the sinner;
_as with_ those who swear an oath, so _also_ those who fear oaths.

###### v3
This _is_ the _injustice_ ^[Literally "evil"] that is done under the sun:
the same fate _comes_ to everyone.
Also the hearts of _humans_ ^[Literally "the sons of the man"] are full _of_ evil;
delusion _is_ in their hearts during their lives, and then they die.

###### v4
Whoever is joined ^[The _Kethib_ reads "chosen," but the _Qere_ as well as all the versions and numerous medieval Hebrew manuscripts read "joined"] to all the living has hope. After all, even a live dog is better than a dead lion!

###### v5
For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything. They no longer have a reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten.

###### v6
What they loved and hated, as well as what they desired, has already perished. They no longer have any share in what is done under the sun.

###### v7
Go--eat your food with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart! For God already has approved your deeds.

###### v8
Always be clothed in white garments, and never let your head lack oil!

###### v9
Enjoy life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which he gives you under the sun, because this _is_ your lot in life and in the toil with which you toil under the sun.

###### v10
Whatever your hand finds to do--do _it_ with _all_ your might; for in Sheol--where you are going--no one works, plans, knows, or thinks about anything.

###### v11
I looked again and saw under the sun that the race _does_ not _belong_ to the swift, the battle _does_ not _belong_ to the mighty, food _does_ not _belong_ to the wise, wealth _does_ not _belong_ to the intelligent, and success ^[Or "favor"] _does_ not _belong_ to the skillful, for time and chance befalls all of them.

###### v12
For man does not know his time. Just as fish are caught in a cruel net and like birds who are seized in a snare, so also _humans_ ^[Literally "the sons of the man"] are ensnared at a cruel time when it falls suddenly upon them.

###### v13
I have also seen this _example of_ wisdom under the sun, and it _seemed_ great to me.

###### v14
_There was_ a small city with few people in it. A great king came and besieged it, building great siege works against it.

###### v15
Now, a poor wise man was found in it, and he delivered the city by his wisdom.

###### v16
So I concluded that wisdom _is_ better than might, yet the wisdom of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard.

###### v17
The words of the wise are heard in peace
_more_ than the shouting of a ruler _is heard_ among the fools.

###### v18
Wisdom _is_ better than weapons of war,
but one sinner destroys much good.
