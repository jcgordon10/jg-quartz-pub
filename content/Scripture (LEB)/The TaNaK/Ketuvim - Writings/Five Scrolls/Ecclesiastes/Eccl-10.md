[[Eccl-09|Previous Chapter]] | [[Eccl-11|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Dead flies cause a bad smell _and_ ruin ^[Or "spew"] the ointment of the perfumer.
So also a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.

###### v2
The heart of the wise _inclines_ to his right,
but the heart of the fool _inclines_ to his left.

###### v3
Even when the fool walks along the road, he lacks sense;
he tells everyone _that_ he is a fool.

###### v4
If the anger of the ruler rises against you,
do not leave your post,
for calmness can undo great offenses.

###### v5
There is an evil I have seen under the sun--
_it is_ an error that proceeds from a ruler!

###### v6
The fool is set in many high places,
but the rich sit in lowly places.

###### v7
I have even seen slaves _riding_ on horses
and princes walking like slaves on the earth!

###### v8
Whoever digs a pit will fall into it.
Whoever breaks through a wall, a snake will bite him.

###### v9
Whoever _quarries_ ^[Literally "breaks out"] stones will be wounded by them.
Whoever splits logs will be endangered by them.

###### v10
If the ax is blunt but one does not sharpen its edge,
_he must exert more effort_, ^[Literally "he must be more strength"]
but the advantage of wisdom _is_ it brings success.

###### v11
If the snake bites before the charming,
_the snake charmer will not succeed_. ^[Literally "there is no advantage to the owner of the charm"]

###### v12
The wise man _wins_ favor by the words of his mouth,
but the fool is devoured by his own lips.

###### v13
He begins by saying what is foolish
and ends by uttering what is wicked delusion.

###### v14
The fool _talks too much_, ^[Literally "increases words"]
for no one knows what will be.
Who can tell anyone what will happen _in the future_? ^[Literally "after him"]

###### v15
The fool is so worn out by a hard day's work
_he cannot even find his way home at night_. ^[Or "for he knows not to go to a city"]

###### v16
Woe to you, O land, when your king is a youth
and your princes feast in the morning.

###### v17
Blessed are you, O land, when your king is a son of nobility
and your princes feast at the proper time--
to gain strength and not to get drunk.

###### v18
Through sloth the roof sinks in,
and through idleness of hands the house leaks.

###### v19
_Feasts are held for celebration_, ^[Literally "They make bread for laughter"]
wine cheers the living,
and money answers everything.

###### v20
Do not curse the king even in your thoughts,
and do not curse the rich even in your own bedroom,
for a bird of the sky may carry your voice;
a winged messenger may repeat your words.
