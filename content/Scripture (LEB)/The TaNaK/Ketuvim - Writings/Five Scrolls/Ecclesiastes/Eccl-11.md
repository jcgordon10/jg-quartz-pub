[[Eccl-10|Previous Chapter]] | [[Eccl-12|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Send out your bread on the water,
for in many days you will find it.

###### v2
Divide your share in seven or in eight,
for you do not know what disaster will happen on the earth.

###### v3
When the clouds are full,
they empty rain on the earth.
Whether a tree falls to the south or whether it falls to the north,
the place where the tree falls--there it will be.

###### v4
Whoever watches the wind will not sow;
whoever watches the clouds will not reap.

###### v5
Just as you do not know how the path of the wind ^[Or "the breath"] _goes_,
nor how the bones _of a fetus_ form in a mother's womb,
so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.

###### v6
Sow your seed in the morning,
and do not let your hands rest in the evening,
for you do not know what will prosper--
whether this or that, or whether both of them alike will succeed.

###### v7
The light is sweet,
and it _is_ pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.

###### v8
For if a man lives many years,
let him rejoice in all of them!
Let him remember that the days of the darkness will be many--
all that is coming _is_ vanity!

###### v9
Rejoice, O young man, in your youth,
and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth!
Follow the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes--
but know that God will bring you into judgment for all these things.

###### v10
Banish anxiety from your heart,
and put away pain from your body,
for youth and vigor _are_ vanity.
