[[Eccl-11|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Remember your Creator in the days of your youth--
before the days of trouble come
and the years draw near when you will say,
"I find no pleasure in them!"

###### v2
Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars darken
and the clouds return after the rain.

###### v3
When the guards of the house tremble,
and the men of strength are bent;
the grinders cease because they are few,
and those looking through the windows see dimly.

###### v4
When the doors on the street are shut,
when the sound of the grinding mill is low;
one rises up to the sound of the bird,
and all the daughters of song are brought low.

###### v5
They are afraid of heights,
and terrors _are_ on the road.
The almond tree blossoms,
and the grasshopper draws itself along, and desire fails
because man goes to his eternal home,
and the mourners go about in the streets.

###### v6
Before the silver cord is snapped
and the golden bowl is broken;
and the jar at the foundation is broken,
and the wheel at the cistern is broken.

###### v7
And the dust returns to the earth as it was,
and the breath returns to God who gave it.

###### v8
"Vanity of vanity!" says the Teacher. ^[Hebrew "Qohelet"]
"Everything _is_ vanity!"

###### v9
The Teacher ^[Hebrew "Qohelet"] was full of wisdom, and he taught the people with knowledge. He carefully considered many proverbs and carefully arranged them.

###### v10
The Teacher ^[Hebrew "Qohelet"] sought to find delightful words, ^[Hebrew "words of delight"] and he wrote ^[The MT reads the term passively, "_what_ is written," but an alternate textual tradition reads, "and he wrote"] what is upright--truthful words.

###### v11
The words of the wise _are_ like cattle goads; the collections of the sages _are_ like pricks inflicted by one shepherd. ^[Or "The owner of collections are given by one shepherd"]

###### v12
My son, be careful _about anything beyond these things_. ^[Literally "but from more than them"] For the writing of books is endless, and too much study _is wearisome_. ^[Literally "increases weariness of flesh"]

###### v13
Now that all has been heard, here is the final conclusion:
Fear God and obey his commandments,
for this _is_ the whole _duty_ of man.

###### v14
For God will bring every deed into judgment,
including every secret thing, whether good or evil.
