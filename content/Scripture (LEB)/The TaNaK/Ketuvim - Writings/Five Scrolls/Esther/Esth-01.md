###### v1
And it happened in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Cush ^[That is, "Ethiopia"]--_over_ one hundred and twenty-seven provinces. ^[Hebrew "province"]

###### v2
In those days as King Ahasuerus was sitting on the throne of his kingdom, which _was_ in the citadel of Susa,

###### v3
he gave a banquet in the third year of his reign for all his officials and servants. The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and officials of the provinces were in his presence

###### v4
as he displayed the wealth of the glory of his kingdom and the glorious splendor of his greatness _for_ many days, one hundred and eighty days ^[Hebrew "day"].

###### v5
And when those days were completed, the king gave for all the people that were present at the citadel of Susa, both great and small, a banquet in the courtyard of the king's palace garden that lasted seven days.

###### v6
There were curtains of finely woven linen and blue cloth tied with cords of fine white linen and purple cloth to silver curtain rings and pillars of alabaster, _and_ couches of gold and silver on a paved floor of alabaster, precious stone, mother-of-pearl, and costly stones. ^[Hebrew "stone"]

###### v7
Drinks were served in goblets of gold and _goblets of different kinds_, ^[Literally "goblets from changing goblets"] and _there was_ _plentiful royal wine according to the bounty of the king_. ^[Literally "much wine of the kingdom according to the hand of the king"]

###### v8
There were no restrictions on the drinking, for the king had instructed every official of his palace to do as each one pleased.

###### v9
Furthermore, Queen Vashti gave a banquet for the women _in_ _the palace_ ^[Literally "_in_ the house of the reign" or "_in_ the house of the kingdom"] that belonged to King Ahasuerus.

###### v10
On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he said to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, seven of the eunuchs attending King Ahasuerus,

###### v11
to bring Queen Vashti before the king _with her royal crown_ ^[Literally "with _her_ headdress of _the_ kingdom"] to show the people and the officials her beauty, _for she was very attractive_. ^[Literally "for she _was_ of good appearance"]

###### v12
But Queen Vashti refused to come at the word of the king that _was_ _conveyed by_ ^[Literally "by the hand of"] the eunuchs. And the king became very angry, and his anger burned in him.

###### v13
And the king said to the wise men, _the ones who know the times_ ^[Literally "the knowers of the times"]--for it _was_ the procedure of the king before all those who knew law and rights; ^[Or "custom and legalities"]

###### v14
and those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memucan, the seven officials of Persia and Media who _had access to the king_ ^[Literally "saw the face of the king"] and sat first in the kingdom--

###### v15
"According to _the_ law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti, because she has not done the command of King Ahasuerus _conveyed by_ ^[Literally "by the hand of"] the eunuchs?

###### v16
And Memucan said before the king and the officials, "Not only has Queen Vashti done wrong to the king, but to all the officials and all of the people who _are_ in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.

###### v17
For this deed of the queen _will be known_ ^[Literally "will go out"] to all the women, causing them _to look with contempt on their husbands_, ^[Literally "to despise their husbands in their eyes"] as they will say, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him but she did not come!'

###### v18
This day the women of nobility from Persia and Media will respond to all the officials of the king and there will be no end to contempt and anger.

###### v19
_If it pleases_ ^[Literally "If it is good to"] the king, let _a royal edict_ ^[Literally "a word of the kingdom"] go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media so that it will not be altered, that Vashti cannot come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to her neighbor who _is_ better than she.

###### v20
And let the king's decree that he will make be proclaimed in all his kingdom, because it _is_ vast and all the women will honor their husbands, great and small." ^[Or "high and low"]

###### v21
_This advice pleased the king_ ^[Literally "The word was good in the eyes of the king] and the officials, and the king acted according to the word of Memucan.

###### v22
And he sent letters to all the provinces of the king, to each province according to its own script, and to every people in their own _language_, ^[Literally "tongue"] that every man should be the master of his house and who speaks in the _language_ ^[Literally "tongue"] of his people.
