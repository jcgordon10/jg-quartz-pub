###### v1
After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her.

###### v2
And the king's servants attending him said, "Let them seek attractive young virgins for the king.

###### v3
Let the king appoint chief officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, and let them gather every attractive young virgin to the _harem_ ^[Literally "house of the women"] in the citadel of Susa _under the care of_ ^[Literally "to the hand of"] Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let him give _them_ their beauty treatment.

###### v4
And let the young woman _who is pleasing_ ^[Literally "who is good"] in the king's eyes become queen in place of Vashti. The thing was good in the king's eyes, and he acted accordingly.

###### v5
There was a Jew in the citadel of Susa whose name _was_ Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite,

###### v6
who was deported ^[Or "exiled"] from Jerusalem with the exiles ^[Hebrew "exile"] who were deported ^[Or "exiled"] with Jeconiah ^[A variant spelling of "Jehoiachin"] the king of Judah, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had deported. ^[Or "exiled"]

###### v7
He ^[That is, Mordecai] was raising Hadassah, that _is_ Esther, his uncle's daughter, ^[That is, his cousin] for she did not have a father or a mother; the young woman _had_ a beautiful figure and _was_ very attractive. When her father and mother died, Mordecai had taken her as his daughter.

###### v8
And it happened, at the proclaiming of the edict of the king and his law, when many young women were being gathered to the citadel of Susa _under Hegai's care_, ^[Literally "to the hand of Hegai"] Esther was taken to the _king's palace_ ^[Literally "house of the king"] _under the care of_ ^[Literally "to the hand of"] Hegai who was in charge of the women.

###### v9
_The young woman pleased him_ ^[Literally "the young woman was good in his eyes"] and she won favor in his presence, and he quickly provided for her beauty treatment and her portion of food, with seven chosen maids to give to her from the _king's palace_, ^[Literally "house of the king"] and he advanced her and her maids to the best part of the _harem_. ^[Literally "house of the women"]

###### v10
Esther did not disclose her people and her family because Modecai had charged her that she must not tell.

###### v11
And every day Modecai would walk up and down in front of the courtyard of the _harem_ ^[Literally "house of the women"] to learn _how Esther was doing_. ^[Literally "the peace of Esther and how it does/does with her"]

###### v12
When the turn came for each girl to go to King Ahasuerus, after the end of twelve months of being under the regulations of the women--for the days of their beauty treatments had to be filled, six months with the oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and women's cosmetics--

###### v13
in this way, the girl goes to the king and all that she asks is given to her _to take_ ^[Literally "to go"] with her from the _harem_ ^[Literally "house of the women"] to the _king's palace_. ^[Literally "house of the king"]

###### v14
In the evening she would go and in the morning she would return to the _second harem_ ^[Literally "second house of the women"] _under the care of_ ^[Literally "to the hand of"] Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch in charge of the concubines. She would not go back to the king unless the king delighted in her and she was called by name.

###### v15
When the turn came near for Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken _her_ as a daughter, to go to the king, she did not ask anything except what Hegai the eunuch of the king who was in charge of the women, advised. And Esther carried favor in the eyes of everyone that saw her.

###### v16
Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, to his _palace_, ^[Literally "house of the reign" or "house of the kingdom"] in the tenth month that is Tebeth in the seventh year of his reign.

###### v17
And the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won his favor and loyalty more than all the virgins, so he put a _royal crown_ ^[Literally "crown of the kingdom"] on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.

###### v18
And the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet, for all his officials and servants. And he granted a tax amnesty ^[See HALOT 252–253 s.v.] to the provinces and he gave gifts with royal liberality.

###### v19
When _the_ virgins were gathered a second time, Mordecai _was_ sitting at the gate of the king.

###### v20
Esther had not made known her family and her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her; for Esther _did what Mordecai told her_, ^[Literally "did the word of Mordecai"] just as when she was brought up by him.

###### v21
In those days Mordecai _was_ sitting at the gate of the king. Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs from the keepers of the threshold, became angry and they conspired _to assassinate_ ^[Literally "to send a hand against"] King Ahasuerus.

###### v22
And the matter became known to Mordecai and he told _it_ to Queen Esther, and Esther told _it_ to the king in the name of Mordecai.

###### v23
And the matter was investigated and found _to be so_; and the two of them were hanged on _the_ gallows, and it was written in the scroll of the events of the days before the presence of the king.
