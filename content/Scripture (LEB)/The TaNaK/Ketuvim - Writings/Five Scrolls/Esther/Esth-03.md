###### v1
After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and he exalted him and set _his position_ ^[Literally "his throne"] above all the officials who _were_ with him.

###### v2
And all of the king's servants who _were_ at the gate of the king _were_ kneeling and bowing down to Haman; for so the king had commanded concerning him, but Mordecai did not kneel and bow down.

###### v3
And the king's servants who _were_ at the gate of the king said to Mordecai, "Why _are_ you transgressing the command of the king?"

###### v4
They spoke to him day after day, but he did not listen to them, and they informed Haman to see if _Mordecai's resolve would prevail_; ^[Literally "the word's of Mordecai would stand"] for he had told them that he _was_ a Jew.

###### v5
And Haman saw that Mordecai was not kneeling and bowing down to him, and he was filled _with_ anger.

###### v6
But _he considered it beneath him_ ^[Literally "he despised it in his eyes"] to lay hands on Mordecai only, for they told him of Mordecai's people, and Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who _were_ in the kingdom of Ahasuerus.

###### v7
In the first month, that _is_, the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasurus, he cast pur--that _is_, the lot--before the presence of Haman _for the day and for the month_, ^[Literally "from day to day and from month to month"] until ^[The Septuagint adds, "and the lot fell on the thirteenth day of"] the twelfth month, that _is_, the month of Adar.

###### v8
And Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered and separated among the peoples in all of the provinces of your kingdom; their laws _are_ different from every _other_ people, and they do not _observe_ ^[Literally "do"] the laws of the king; it is not appropriate for the king to tolerate them.

###### v9
If it pleases the king, let a _decree_ be issued to destroy them, and I will pay ^[Or "I will weigh"] ten thousand talents ^[Hebrew "talent"] of silver to those who do the job, to bring to the treasury of the king."

###### v10
So the king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.

###### v11
And the king said to Haman, "The money _is_ given to you and to the people to do with it _as you see fit_. ^[Literally "as the good _is_ in your eyes"]

###### v12
And the king's secretaries were called in the first month on the thirteenth day, and _a decree_ was issued, according to all that Haman commanded, to the satraps of the king and to the governors who _were_ over all the provinces, and to _the_ officials of all the people, to each province according to _its own_ script and to all people according to their own language; _it was_ written in the name of King Ahasuerus and _was_ sealed with the king's ring.

###### v13
Letters _were_ sent by couriers ^[Or "by runners"] to all the provinces of the king to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, _both young and old_, ^[Literally "from young to old"] women and children, on one day, the thirteenth day of the month, that _is_ Adar, and to plunder their goods.

###### v14
A copy of the edict _was_ presented _as_ law in every province making _it_ known to all the people to be ready for that day.

###### v15
The couriers went out quickly by order of the king, and the law was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; and the city of Susa was bewildered. ^[Or "disturbed"]
