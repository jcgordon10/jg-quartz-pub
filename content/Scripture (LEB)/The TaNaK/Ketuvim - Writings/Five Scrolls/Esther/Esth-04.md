###### v1
Mordecai learned all that had been done and he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes. And he went through the middle of the city and cried out a loud and bitter cry;

###### v2
he went up to the entrance of the gate of the king, for he could not go to the gate of the king in sackcloth.

###### v3
In every province _each_ place where the king's edict and his law came, there _was_ great mourning for the Jews with fasting, crying, wailing, _and_ sackcloth; and ashes were spread out as a bed for them.

###### v4
And Esther's maids and her eunuchs came and they told her, and the queen was deeply distressed; she sent garments to clothe Mordecai so that he might remove his sackcloth--but he did not accept _them_.

###### v5
Then Esther called Hathach from the king's eunuchs _who regularly attended to her_, ^[Literally "who stood before her presence"] and she ordered him _to go_ to Mordecai to learn what was happening and why.

###### v6
So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the public square of the city, which _was_ in front of the gate of the king,

###### v7
and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact amount of money that Haman has promised to pay to the treasury of the king for the destruction of the Jews.

###### v8
And he gave him a copy of the edict of the law that had been issued in Susa for their destruction to show Esther, and to inform her, and to charge her to go to the king and make supplication to him and entreat before him for her people.

###### v9
And Hathach went _back_ and told Esther the words of Mordecai.

###### v10
And Esther spoke to Hathach and _she gave him a message for Mordecai_: ^[Literally "she charged him to Mordecai"]

###### v11
"All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that _if_ any man or woman who goes to the king to the inner courtyard, who is not called, he has one law, to be killed, except if the king extends to him the gold scepter so that he may live. I have not been called to come to the king _for thirty days_." ^[Literally "these thirty days"]

###### v12
And they told Mordecai the words of Esther.

###### v13
Then Mordecai told _them_ to reply to Esther: "Do not think that your life will be saved _in_ the palace of the king more than all the Jews.

###### v14
For if indeed you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, and you and the family of your father will perish. Who knows? _Perhaps_ you have come to a royal position for a time such as this."

###### v15
Esther replied to Mordecai:

###### v16
"Go, gather all the Jews that are found in Susa and fast for me; do not eat or drink _for_ three days, both night and day. I and my young girls will fast likewise, and then I will go to the king, which _is_ not according to the law; if I perish, I perish.

###### v17
And Mordecai went away and he did everything that Esther commanded him.
