###### v1
And it happened, on the third day, and Esther put on royal clothes, and she stood in the inner courtyard of the _king's palace_, ^[Literally "house of the king"] opposite the _king's palace_; ^[Literally "house of the king"] the king _was_ sitting on his royal throne in the _throne room_ ^[Literally "house of the reign" or "house of the kingdom"] opposite the doorway of the palace.

###### v2
When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard she found favor in his eyes, and the king held out the gold scepter that _was_ in his hand to Esther, and Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter.

###### v3
And the king said to her, "What _is_ it, Queen Esther? What _is_ your request? It will be given to you--even half the kingdom."

###### v4
And Esther said, "If it is good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him."

###### v5
And the king said, "Bring Haman quickly _to fulfill_ ^[Literally "to do"] the request of Esther." So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.

###### v6
And the king said to Esther _while they were drinking wine_, ^[Literally "at the meal of wine"] "What _is_ your petition? It will be given to you. What _is_ your request? Even half the kingdom, it will done.

###### v7
And Esther answered and said, "_This is_ my petition and my request.

###### v8
If I have found favor in the eyes of the king, ^[Or "I have won the favor of the king] and if it is good to the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them tomorrow, and I will do according to the word of the king.

###### v9
And Haman went out on that day rejoicing and _feeling good_. ^[Literally "good of heart"] But when Haman saw Mordecai at the gate of the king, and he did not rise or tremble before him, Haman was filled _with rage toward_ ^[Literally "rage to"] Mordecai.

###### v10
But Haman controlled himself and went to his house, and he sent _for_ and brought his friends and Zeresh his wife.

###### v11
And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his wealth and the number of his sons and all _the ways_ that the king had honored him and promoted him above the officials and king's servants.

###### v12
_And Haman added_, ^[Literally "And Haman said also"] "Esther the Queen did not let _just anyone_ come to the banquet that she prepared with the king except me, and I am also invited tomorrow to her _banquet_ with the king.

###### v13
But all this _fails to satisfy me_ ^[Literally "it is not sufficient for me"] _when_ ^[Literally "at every time"] I see Mordecai the Jew setting at the gate of the king."

###### v14
And Zeresh his wife and all of his friends said to him, "Let them make a gallows fifty cubits ^[Hebrew "cubit"] high, and in the morning tell the king, "Let them hang Mordecai on it; then go with the king to the banquet happily." The advice pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.
