###### v1
So the king and Haman went _to dine_ ^[Literally "to drink"] with Queen Esther.

###### v2
And the king again said to Esther, on the second day _while they were drinking_, ^[Literally "at the meal of wine"] "What _is_ your petition, Queen Esther? It will be given to you. What _is_ your request? It will be given _to you_--even half the kingdom."

###### v3
Then Queen Esther answered, and she said, "If I have found favor in your eyes, ^[Or "If I have won your favor"] O king, and if it is good to the king, let my life be given to me at my petition and my people at my request;

###### v4
I and my people have been sold to be destroyed and killed, to be annihilated. If we had been sold as male and female slaves I would have kept quiet, because this ^[Hebrew "there"] is not a need sufficient to trouble the king." ^[See HALOT 1437, s.v. NRSV translates, "but no enemy can compensate for this damage to the king"]

###### v5
And King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, "Who _is_ he, and where _is_ he, who _gave himself the right to do this_?" ^[Literally "has filled his heart to do so"]

###### v6
And Esther said, "The adversary and enemy _is_ this evil Haman!" And Haman was terrified before the king and queen.

###### v7
The king rose in his anger _from the banquet_ ^[Literally "from the banquet of wine"] _and went_ to the palace garden, and Haman stood to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for _he realized that the king was determined to make an end to his life_. ^[Literally "that evil had been determined for him from the king"]

###### v8
And the king returned from the palace garden to the _banquet hall_, ^[Literally "house of the meal of wine"] _where_ Haman _was_ lying prostrate on the couch that Esther _was_ on, and the king said, "Will he also molest the queen with me in the house?" As the words ^[Hebrew "word"] went from the king's mouth they covered Haman's face.

###### v9
And Habrona, one of the eunuchs in the presence of the king, said, "Look, the same gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai who spoke good _for the sake_ of the king stands at Haman's house, fifty cubits high." And the king said, "Hang him on it."

###### v10
And they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai, and the anger of the king was abated.
