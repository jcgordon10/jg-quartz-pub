###### v8
Write _as you see fit_ ^[Literally "as it _is_ good in your eyes"] concerning the Jews in the name of the king, and seal _it_ with the king's signet ring; for a decree that is written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's signet ring cannot be revoked."

###### v9
And the secretaries of the king were summoned ^[Or "called"] at that time, in the third month, which _is_ in the month of Sivan on the twenty-third _day_, and _an edict_ was written according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews and to the governors and satraps and officials of the provinces from India to Cush ^[That is, "Ethiopia"]--one hundred and twenty-seven provinces ^[Hebrew "province"]--each province according to its own script and to every people in their own _language_, ^[Literally "tongue"] and to the Jews in their own script and language.

###### v11
_In them_ the king allowed the Jews who _were_ in every city to assemble and _defend their lives_, ^[Literally "to stand for their live_s_"] to destroy and kill and annihilate any army of any people or province attacking them, including women and children, and to plunder their spoil,

A copy of the _edict_ ^[Literally "writing"] _was_ to be given _as_ law in each province to inform all the people, so that the Jews would be ready ^[See HALOT 902 s.v.] on that day to avenge themselves from their enemies.

For the Jews, there was light and gladness, joy and honor.

###### v17
In every province and city, wherever the king's edict and his law came, there was gladness and joy for the Jews, a banquet and a _holiday_, ^[Literally "day of good"] and many of the people from the country _were_ posing as Jews because the fear of the Jews had fallen on them.
