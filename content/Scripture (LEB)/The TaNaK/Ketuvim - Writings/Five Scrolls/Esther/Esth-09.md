###### v1
In the twelfth month, that _is_ the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, on which the edict of the king arrived and his law was enacted, on the day in which the enemies of the Jews had hoped to gain power over them but was overturned, _and_ the Jews gained power against their enemies,

###### v2
the Jews gathered in their cities in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus _to strike against_ ^[Literally "to send a hand against"] those who sought their destruction, and no one could withstand them, ^[Or "stand in their presence"] as the fear of them fell on all the people.

###### v3
All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, governors, and _those who did the work of the king_ ^[Literally "the doers of the work who _were_ for the king"] _were_ supporting the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.

###### v4
For Mordecai _was_ high-ranking in the _king's palace_ ^[Literally "house of the king"] and his fame spread throughout all the provinces as _Mordecai grew more and more powerful_. ^[Literally "the man Mordecai _was_ going and becoming great"]

###### v5
The Jews struck down all their enemies with _the sword_, ^[Literally "the striking of _the_ sword"] killing and destroying _them_; and they did as they pleased with those that hated them.

###### v6
And in the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men,

###### v7
and Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,

###### v8
Portha, Adalia, Aridatha,

###### v9
Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,

###### v10
the ten sons of Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews; but they did not _touch_ ^[Literally "send their hand to"] the plunder.

###### v11
On that day the number of those being killed in the citadel of Susa _was reported to_ ^[Literally "came before"] the king.

###### v12
And the king said to Queen Esther, "In the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? What _is_ your petition? It will be granted to you. And what further _is_ your request? It will be done."

###### v13
Esther replied, "If it is good to the king, let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who _are_ in Susa to do according to the edict of today; and let them hang Haman's ten sons on the gallows."

###### v14
And the king said to do so. And a decree was issued in Susa and Haman's ten sons were hanged.

###### v15
And the Jews were gathered who _were_ in Susa, and on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed in Susa three hundred men, but they did not _touch_ ^[Literally "send their hand to"] the plunder.

###### v16
The rest of the Jews who _were_ in the king's provinces gathered and _defended their lives_ ^[Literally "to stand for their live_s_"] and _found repose_ ^[Literally "rested"] from their enemies. And they killed seventy-five thousand of those that hated them, but they did not _touch_ ^[Literally "send their hand to"] the plunder.

###### v17
_This was_ on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. _They_ rested on the fourteenth _day_ and made it a day of feasting and joy.

###### v18
But the Jews who _were_ in Susa gathered on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day, and rested on the fifteenth day. And they made it a day of feasting and joy.

###### v19
Therefore the Jews in the rural _areas_, living in the rural towns, made the fourteenth month of Adar a day of joy and feasting, a festive day of giving gifts to each other.

###### v20
Mordecai wrote down these things and he sent letters to all the Jews who _were_ in all _of_ the provinces of King Ahasuerus, _both_ near and far,

###### v21
to impose on them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and the fifteenth _day_, _every year_, ^[Literally "and every year and year"]

###### v22
as the day that the Jews _found relief_ ^[Literally "rested"] from their enemies, and the month which changed for them from sorrow to joy, and from a mourning ceremony to a _festive day_; ^[Literally "a day of good"] to make them days of feasting and joy, and giving gifts to each other and to the poor.

###### v23
And the Jews adopted what they had begun to do and what Mordecai had written to them.

###### v24
For Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and he had cast pur, that _is_ the lot, to rout them out and destroy them.

###### v25
But when it came ^[Or "she came"] _to the attention of_ ^[Literally "before"] the king, he _gave orders in writing_ ^[Literally "said with a scroll"] _that_ his evil plot that he had devised against the Jews should return on his head, and they hung him and his sons on the gallows.

###### v26
Therefore they called these days Purim, because of the name Pur. Thus because of all the words of this letter, and of what they faced concerning this, and of what had happened to them,

###### v27
the Jews established and adopted _it_ for themselves and for their offspring, and for all who joined them. They did not neglect _to observe_ ^[Literally "to be doing"] these two days every year as it was written and appointed to them.

###### v28
These days _are_ to be remembered and _are_ to be kept in every generation, and in family, province, and city; and these days of Purim are not _to be_ neglected among the Jews, and their memory shall not come to an end among their offspring.

###### v29
So Queen Esther the daughter of Abihail and Mordecai the Jew wrote in full authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.

###### v30
He sent letters of words of peace and truth to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces ^[Hebrew "province"] of Ahasuerus' kingdom,

###### v31
to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had imposed, and just as they had imposed on themselves and their offspring regulations of the fast and their lament.

###### v32
And the command of Esther established these practices of Purim, and _it was_ written on the scroll.
