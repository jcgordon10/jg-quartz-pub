[[Esth-09|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
King Ahasuerus imposed forced labor on the land and islands of the sea.

###### v2
All the work of his authority and his _powerful deeds_, ^[Literally "power"] and the full accounting of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written on the scroll of the _chronicles_ ^[Literally "the events of the days"] of the kings of Media and Persia?

###### v3
For Mordecai the Jew _was_ second-in-command to King Ahasuerus. _He was_ great for the Jews and popular with many of his brothers, for he sought good for his people, _interceding for the welfare of all his descendants_. ^[Literally "spoke peace for all his offspring"]
