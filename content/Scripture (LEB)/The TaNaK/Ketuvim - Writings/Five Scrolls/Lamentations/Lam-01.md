[[Lam-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
How desolate the city sits
_that_ was full of people!
She has become like a widow,
_once_ great among the nations!
Like a woman of nobility in the provinces,
she has become a forced laborer.

###### v2
She weeps bitterly in the night,
her tears _are_ on her cheeks;
she has no comforter
among all her lovers.
All her friends have been unfaithful to her;
they have become her enemies.

###### v3
Judah has gone into exile with misery
and under hard servitude;
she lives among the nations,
she has not found a resting place;
all her pursuers have overtaken her
amidst _her_ distress.

###### v4
The roads of Zion _are_ mourning
because no one comes to the festival.
All her gates _are_ desolate,
her priests groan;
her young women _are_ worried,
and she herself suffers bitterly.

###### v5
Her foes have become _her_ _master_, ^[Literally "head"]
her enemies are at ease;
Yahweh has made her suffer
because of the greatness of her transgressions.
Her children have gone away,
captive before the foe.

###### v6
All her majesty has gone away
from the daughter of Zion;
her princes have become like young stags
that have not found pasture;
they have gone away without strength,
before the pursuer.

###### v7
Jerusalem remembers
the days of her misery and wanderings,
all her treasures
that were from the days of long ago.
When her people fell into _the_ hand of the enemy,
there was no one helping her;
the enemies saw her, they mocked
at her destruction.

###### v8
Jerusalem sinned grievously,
thus she became an objection of derision;
all those who honored her despise her
because they have seen her nakedness.
She herself groans
and turns away.

###### v9
Her uncleanness _was_ in her skirts;
she did not remember her future,
she has descended beyond understanding,
there is no comforter for her.
See, O Yahweh, my persecution!
_My_ enemy has been made great!

###### v10
The enemy has stretched out his hand
over all her treasures;
for she has seen the nations,
they entered her sanctuary,
those whom you commanded not to enter
in your assembly.

###### v11
All her people groan,
they are searching for bread.
They give their treasures for food,
to bring back life.
See, O Yahweh, and look,
_how_ I am despised.

###### v12
Is it nothing to you, _all who pass by_? ^[Literally "all who cross a road"]
Look and see
if there is sorrow like my sorrow, ^[Or "pain like my pain"]
which was dealt to me,
which Yahweh inflicted
on the _day of his wrath_. ^[Literally "on the day of the blaze of his nose"]

###### v13
From heaven he sent fire,
into my bones he let it descend.
He spread out a net for my feet;
he turned me back,
he gave me devastation,
fainting all day.

###### v14
My rebellion was bound _as_ a yoke,
with his hand it was fastened together;
it was put on my neck
_and_ caused my strength to fail.
The Lord gave me into the hands
_of those whom_ I cannot withstand.

###### v15
The Lord has rejected
all my mighty ones in my midst.
He called an assembly against me,
to crush my young men;
_like in_ a wine press,
the Lord has trodden _on_
the virgin daughter of Judah.

###### v16
For these _things_, I am weeping,
_my eyes flow with tears_; ^[Literally "my eye my eye is going down _with_ water"]
because a comforter is far from me,
one to restore my life.
My sons are desolate
because _the_ enemy has prevailed.

###### v17
Zion stretches out her hands;
there is no one to comfort her.
Yahweh has commanded against Jacob,
_that_ those surrounding him ^[NRSV translates "his neighbors"] _should be_ his enemies;
Jerusalem has become
a defilement among them.

###### v18
Yahweh is righteous;
I have rebelled _against_ _his word_. ^[Literally "his mouth"]
Please hear, all _the_ nations,
And see my pain;
My young women ^[Or "virgins"] and young men
went into captivity.

###### v19
I have called to my lovers,
they themselves deceived me;
my priests and elders perished in the city
when they sought food for themselves
to revive their life. ^[Or "their soul"]

###### v20
See, O Yahweh, that _I am in distress_; ^[Literally "_there is_ distress for me"]
_my stomach_ ^[Literally "inner parts"] is in torment,
my heart has turned inside me
because I have certainly rebelled.
From outside a sword brings bereavement,
inside the house _it is_ like death.

###### v21
They hear that I was groaning;
_there is_ no comforter for me.
All my enemies have heard my misery,
they are pleased that you have done it.
Bring _that_ day that you have proclaimed, ^[Or "you have called"]
And let them be like me.

###### v22
Let all their evil come before you;
and deal with them
just as you have dealt with me
because of all my crimes;
for my groaning is much and my heart _is_ faint.
