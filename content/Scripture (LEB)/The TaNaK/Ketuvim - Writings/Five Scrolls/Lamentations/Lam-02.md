###### v1
How, _in his anger_, ^[Literally "in his nose"]
the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion in a cloud!
He has thrown down from heavens _to_ earth
the splendor of Israel,
and he has not remembered his footstool
in the day of _his anger_. ^[Literally "his nose"]

###### v2
The Lord has devoured; he has not shown mercy
to all the dwellings of Jacob;
he has broken down in his wrath
the fortifications of the daughter of Judah;
he has leveled to the ground, he has dishonored
the kingdom and its commanders. ^[Or "her commanders"]

###### v3
He has cut down _in fierce anger_ ^[Literally "in a fierce nose"]
all the might of Israel;
he has withdrawn his right hand
from the faces of _the_ enemy,
and he has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire,
it has consumed all around.

###### v4
He has bent his bow like an enemy;
he has set his right hand
like a foe, and he has slain
all _the_ treasures of _the_ eye; ^[NRSV translates "all in whom we took pride"]
in the tent of the daughter of Zion,
he has poured out his anger like fire.

###### v5
The Lord has become like an enemy;
he has destroyed Israel;
he has destroyed all its citadel fortresses; ^[Or "her citadel fortresses"]
he has ruined all its fortifications
and multiplied lamentation and mourning
in the daughter of Judah.

###### v6
He has broken down _his dwelling_ ^[Literally "his booth"; or "his tabernacle"] place like the garden;
he has ruined his appointed feasts;
Yahweh has made _them_ forget in Zion
_festival_ ^[Literally "appointed time"] and Sabbath,
and he has despised in his anger
king and priest.

###### v7
The Lord has rejected his altar;
he has rejected his sanctuary;
he has delivered into the hands of the enemy
the walls of its citadel fortresses. ^[Or "her citadel fortress"]
They have cried out in the house of Yahweh
like a day of an appointed feast.

###### v8
Yahweh has planned to destroy
the wall of the daughter of Zion.
He measured _with_ a line; he has not restrained
his hand from destroying;
he caused rampart and wall to mourn;
together they have languished away.

###### v9
Her gates have sunk into the earth;
he has ruined and broken her bars,
her kings and its princes _are_ among the nations;
there is no more law. ^[Hebrew _torah_]
Also, her prophets have not found
a revelation from Yahweh.

###### v10
They sit on the ground,
the elders of the daughter of Zion are silent.
They cast dust on their head,
they have put on sackcloth;
the young women of Jerusalem
have bowed their head down to the ground.

###### v11
My eyes have _spent all their tears_; ^[Literally "finished with the weeping"]
_my stomach_ ^[Literally "my inward parts"] is in torment,
_my heart_ ^[Literally "my liver"] is poured out on the earth
because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,
because child and babe faint
in _the_ public squares of a city.

###### v12
To their mothers they say,
"Where is the bread and wine?"
as they faint like the wounded
in _the_ public squares of a city,
as their life is being poured out
onto the bosom of their mothers.

###### v13
What can I say for you? What can I compare to you,
O daughter of Jerusalem?
To what can I liken you so that I can comfort you,
O virgin daughter of Zion?
For your destruction _is_ as vast as the sea;
who can heal you?

###### v14
Your prophets had a vision for you,
false and worthless;
they have not exposed your sin,
to restore your fortune;
they have seen oracles for you,
false and misleading.

###### v15
They clap hands over you,
all who pass along the way;
they hiss and they shake their head,
at the daughter of Jerusalem.
Is this the city of which it is said,
"A perfection of beauty, a joy for all the earth?"

###### v16
They have opened their mouths against you,
all your enemies.
They hiss and gnash a tooth,
and they say, "We have destroyed _her_!
Surely this _is_ the day we have hoped for;
we have found _it_, we have seen _it_!"

###### v17
Yahweh has done what he has planned;
he has fulfilled his promise
that he ordained from the days of old;
he has demolished and not shown mercy;
he has made an enemy rejoice over you,
he has exalted the _might_ ^[Literally "horn"] of your foes.

###### v18
Their heart cried to the Lord,
"O wall of the daughter of Zion,
let tears stream down like a river;
day and night,
do not give yourself relief,
do not give your eyes rest.

###### v19
"Arise, cry out in the night,
at the beginning of the night watches;
pour out your heart like water,
before the face of the Lord.
Lift to him your hands,
for the life of your children,
who faint in starvation,
at the head of all streets."

###### v20
See, Yahweh, and take note!
With whom have you dealt thus?
Should women eat their young
children of tender care?
Should priest and prophet be slain
in the sanctuary of the Lord?

###### v21
They lie in _the_ soil of _the_ streets,
young and old;
my young women ^[Or "my virgins"] and young men,
they have fallen by the sword;
you have slain on the day of _your anger_, ^[Literally "your nose"]
you have slaughtered and not shown mercy.

###### v22
You have summoned my horror from all around,
as if for a feast day;
no one on the day of Yahweh's anger
_is_ a fugitive and a survivor;
whoever I have cared for and reared,
my enemy has destroyed.
