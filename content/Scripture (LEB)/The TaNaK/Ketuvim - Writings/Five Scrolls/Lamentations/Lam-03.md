###### v1
I am a man who has seen misery,
under the rod of his wrath.

###### v2
He has driven me along, he brought
darkness and not light.

###### v3
Surely he has turned his hand against me,
all day long.

###### v4
He has worn out my flesh and skin,
he has broken my bones.

###### v5
_He has besieged_ ^[Literally "he has built against"] and engulfed me
with bitterness and hardship.

###### v6
In darkness he has let me dwell
like _the_ dead of long ago.

###### v7
He has built a wall around me, I cannot go out;
he has made my bronze fetters heavy.

###### v8
Though I cry out for help,
he shuts out my prayers.

###### v9
He has blocked my ways with dressed stones;
he has made my paths crooked.

###### v10
To me he _is_ like a bear lying in wait,
a lion in hiding.

###### v11
He has forsaken my way and torn me to pieces;
he has caused me desolation.

###### v12
He has bent his bow and set me
as the target for the arrow.

###### v13
He shot _the arrows of his quiver_ ^[Literally "the offspring of his arrow quiver"]
into my kidneys.

###### v14
I have become a laughingstock for all the people,
their mocking song all day long.

###### v15
He has filled me with bitterness,
he has drenched me _with_ wormwood.

###### v16
He has broken my teeth on grit,
he has trampled me down in ash.

###### v17
My life has been removed from peace,
I have forgotten goodness.

###### v18
And I have said, "My glory is ruined,
my expectation from Yahweh."

###### v19
Remember my misery and bitterness,
the wormwood ^[Or "the bitter substance"] and venom!

###### v20
Surely my soul remembers
and bows down within me.

###### v21
This _I have reminded myself_, ^[Literally "I have brought back to my heart"]
therefore I will hope.

###### v22
The loyal love of Yahweh does not cease;
his compassions do not come to an end.

###### v23
_They_ are new in the morning,
great is your faithfulness.

###### v24
"Yahweh is my portion,"
says my soul,
"Thus I will hope on him."

###### v25
Yahweh is good to those who wait on him,
to the person that seeks him.

###### v26
_It is_ good to wait in silence
for the salvation of Yahweh.

###### v27
_It is_ good for a man who carries
the yoke of his childhood.

###### v28
Let him sit alone and be silent
when he ^[Yahweh] has laid it on him.

###### v29
Let _him put_ ^[Literally "him give"] his mouth in the dust;
perhaps there is hope.

###### v30
Let him give a cheek to his smiter,
let him be filled with disgrace.

###### v31
For the Lord will not reject
forever.

###### v32
For even though he causes grief he has compassion
according to the greatness of his royal love.

###### v33
He does not _afflict willingly_, ^[Literally "afflict from the heart"]
or grieve _anyone_. ^[Literally "the sons of men"]

###### v34
To crush under his feet
all _the_ prisoners of _the_ earth;

###### v35
_to deprive one of justice_ ^[Literally "to turn aside the judgment of a man"]
before the face of the Most High;

###### v36
to subvert a person in a legal dispute
--the Lord has not found delight _in these things_.

###### v37
_Who can speak_ ^[Literally "Who is this that speaks"] and it will happen
_if_ the Lord has not commanded _it_?

###### v38
_Is_ it not from the mouth of the Most High
_that_ disaster and good will come?

###### v39
Why should any living person complain
about his sin?

###### v40
Let us test and examine our ways;
let us return to Yahweh.

###### v41
Let us lift up our hearts with our hands
to God in the heavens.

###### v42
We ourselves have transgressed and rebelled,
you have not forgiven.

###### v43
You have covered _yourself_ _in anger_ ^[Literally "in the nose"] and pursued us,
you have slain and not shown mercy.

###### v44
You have covered yourself in a cloud
_so that prayer cannot pass through_. ^[Literally "from a passing prayer"]

###### v45
You have made us scum and refuse
in the midst of the nations.

###### v46
All our enemies
have opened their mouth against us.

###### v47
Fear and a pit have come upon us,
desolation and destruction.

###### v48
Channels of water run down my eyes
because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.

###### v49
My eyes have poured down unceasingly
without respite,

###### v50
until Yahweh looks down
and sees from heaven.

###### v51
My eyes inflict my soul
because of all the daughters of my city.

###### v52
My enemies hunt me without cause,
like a bird.

###### v53
_They have silenced me in a pit_, ^[Literally "they have put to silence my life in a pit"]
they have thrown a stone at me.

###### v54
Water has flown over my head,
I said, "I am cut off."

###### v55
I have called your name, O Yahweh,
from the depths of the pit.

###### v56
You have heard my cry, "Do not shut your ear
to my cry for help, for my relief!"

###### v57
You came near on a day _when_ I called you,
you said, "Do not fear!"

###### v58
O Lord, you have pleaded for _my cause_, ^[Literally "the legal disputes of my soul"]
you have redeemed my life.

###### v59
You have seen my injustice, O Yahweh;
judge my case.

###### v60
You have seen all their vengeance,
all there plans against me.

###### v61
You have heard their disgrace, O Yahweh,
all their plans against me.

###### v62
The lips and meditation of my assailants
_are_ against me all day long.

###### v63
Look at their sitting and their standing,
I _am_ their mocking song.

###### v64
Return to them what is deserved, O Yahweh,
according to the work of their hands.

###### v65
Give them a stubborn heart;
curse them!

###### v66
Pursue them _in anger_ ^[Literally "in nose"] and destroy them
from under the heavens of Yahweh.
