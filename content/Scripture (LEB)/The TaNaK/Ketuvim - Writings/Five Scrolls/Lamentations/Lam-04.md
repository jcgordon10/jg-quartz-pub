[[Lam-03|Previous Chapter]] | [[Lam-05|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
How _the_ gold has grown dim,
the pure gold has changed.
The stones of holiness are scattered
at the head of every street.

###### v2
The precious sons of Zion
weighed against fine gold,
how they are thought of as earthen vessels of clay,
the work of the potter's hands.

###### v3
Even the jackal bears the beast
and nurses their cubs;
_but_ the daughter of my people has become ruthless,
like ostriches in the wilderness.

###### v4
The tongue of the nursling cleaves
to its palate in thirst.
Children beg _for_ food,
_no one lays it out before them_. ^[Literally "nothing spreads to them"]

###### v5
The ones who eat delicacies,
they are ruined in the streets;
the ones nurtured in purple
lie _on_ piles of trash.

###### v6
The iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater
than the sin of Sodom;
it was overthrown in a moment
and no hands were laid on her.

###### v7
Her princes were purer than snow,
they were whiter than milk;
_their_ bodies were more ruddy than rubies,
sapphire their appearance.

###### v8
_Now_ their appearance is blacker than soot,
they are not recognized in the streets;
their skin has shriveled on their bones,
it has become dry like wood.

###### v9
Happier were _the_ victims of _the_ sword
than the victims of famine;
they have pined away, very hungry
for the crops of my field.

###### v10
_The_ hands of compassionate women,
have cooked their children;
they became as something to eat
in the destruction of the daughter of my people.

###### v11
Yahweh has completed his anger,
he has poured out _his fierce anger_; ^[Literally "the fierce anger of his nose"]
he has kindled a fire in Zion,
it consumed her ^[Or "its"] foundations.

###### v12
_The_ kings of _the_ earth did not believe,
and all _the_ inhabitants of _the_ world,
that a foe and an enemy could enter
into the gates of Jerusalem.

###### v13
Because of the sins of her prophets,
the guilt of her priests,
who shed blood in her midst,
of righteous people.

###### v14
They wander blindly in the streets;
they were defiled with the blood,
their clothes
could not be touched.

###### v15
"Go away! Defiled!" they shout to them.
"Go away! Go away! Do not touch!"
so they left, they left; it was said among the nations,
"_They will no longer dwell with us_." ^[Literally "They will no longer be _here_ as aliens"]

###### v16
The presence of Yahweh has scattered them,
he will no longer watch over them;
_they did not honor the priests_, ^[Literally "they did not lift up the faces of the priests"]
they did not show mercy _to_ elders.

###### v17
Still our eyes failed,
_looking for_ our help in vain;
in our watchtower, we kept watch
for a nation that could not save.

###### v18
They hunted our steps,
from walking in our streets;
our end has come near, _our days are finished_, ^[Literally "our days are filled"]
our end has come.

###### v19
Our pursuers were swifter
than _the_ eagles of _the_ heavens;
they chased us on the mountains,
they have set an ambush for us in the desert.

###### v20
The breath of our nostrils, the anointed one of Yahweh,
was captured in their pits;
of whom we said, "In his shadow
we will live among the nations."

###### v21
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,
you who dwell in the land of Uz;
but to you also the cup will pass,
you will become drunk and strip yourself bare.

###### v22
The _punishment_ of your iniquity is completed, O daughter of Zion,
your exile will not continue;
_but_ he will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom,
he will reveal your sins.
