[[Lam-04|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Remember, O Yahweh, what has become of us;
take note, and see our disgrace!

###### v2
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
our houses, to foreigners.

###### v3
We have become orphans, fatherless,
our mothers are like widows.

###### v4
_We pay for water with money_, ^[Literally "we drink our water by money"]
our wood comes _to us_ at a price.

###### v5
We are driven on our necks;
we are weary, there is no rest for us.

###### v6
We have made a deal with Egypt _and_ Assyria
to be satisfied _with_ food.

###### v7
Our fathers have sinned, they are no more;
we bear their iniquity.

###### v8
Slaves rule over us;
there is no one to deliver us from their hand.

###### v9
_We risk our life for food_ ^[Literally "We take our food at our life"]
because of the sword of the desert.

###### v10
Our skin is hot like an oven
because of the scorching famine.

###### v11
They raped women in Zion,
young women ^[Or "virgins"] in the cities of Judah.

###### v12
They hang princes by their hand;
they do not show respect before elders.

###### v13
Young men must carry a hand-mill
and boys stumble under the wood.

###### v14
Elders are no longer at the gate,
young men no longer play stringed instruments.

###### v15
The joy of our hearts has stopped;
our circle-dancing has changed to a mourning ceremony.

###### v16
The crown has fallen from our head;
woe to us, for we have sinned!

###### v17
Because of this, our heart has become faint,
because of these, our eyes have become dim.

###### v18
Because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate,
_foxes tread on it_. ^[Literally "foxes go on it"]

###### v19
You, O Yahweh, will sit forever
_on_ your throne for generation to generation.

###### v20
Why have you forgotten us forever?
Why have you forsaken us _for so long_? ^[Literally "for long days"]

###### v21
Restore us to you, O Yahweh, that we will be restored;
renew our days as of old.

###### v22
Unless you have utterly rejected us,
unless you are angry with us beyond measure.
