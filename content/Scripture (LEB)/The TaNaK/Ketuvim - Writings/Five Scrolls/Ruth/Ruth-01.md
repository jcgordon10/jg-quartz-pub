[[Ruth-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
And it happened in the days _when_ _the judges ruled_, ^[Literally "the judging of the judges"] there was a famine in the land, and a man from Bethlehem _of_ Judah went _to reside_ ^[Literally "to dwell as an alien"] in the countryside of Moab--he and his wife and his two sons.

###### v2
And the name of the man _was_ Elimelech, and the name of his wife _was_ Naomi, and the name_s_ of his two sons _were_ Mahlon and Kilion. _They were_ Ephraimites from Bethlehem _in_ Judah. And they went _to_ the countryside of Moab and remained there.

###### v3
But Elimelech the husband of Naomi died and she was left behind _with_ _her two sons_. ^[Literally "she and her two sons"]

###### v4
And _they took_ ^[Literally "they lifted up"] for themselves Moabite wives. The name of the one _was_ Orpah and the name of the other _was_ Ruth. And they lived there about ten years.

###### v5
But _both_ ^[Literally "the two of them"] Mahlon and Kilion died, and the woman was left without her two sons and without her husband.

###### v6
And she got up, she and her daughters-in-law, and returned from the countryside of Moab, because she had heard in the countryside of Moab that Yahweh had _come to the aid of_ ^[Literally "had considered"] his people to give food to them.

###### v7
So she set out from the place _where she was_ ^[Literally "which she was there"] and her two daughters-in-law with her, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.

###### v8
But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, each _of you_ return to her mother's house. May Yahweh _show kindness to you_ ^[Literally "do loyal love with you"] _just_ as you did with the dead and with me.

###### v9
May Yahweh _grant that you_ ^[Literally "give to you"] find a resting place, each _in_ the house of her husband." And she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice_s_ and cried.

###### v10
And they said to her, "_No,_ we want to return with you to your people."

###### v11
And Naomi said, "Return, my daughters. _Why do you still want to go with me_? ^[Literally "To what do you want to go still for me?"] _Are there_ sons _in my womb_ ^[Literally "in my intestines"] that may be husbands for you?

###### v12
Turn back, my daughters! Go, for _I am too old to have a husband_. ^[Literally "I am too old from being to a man"] If I should think there is hope for me, even if I should have a husband _this_ night, and even if I should bear sons,

###### v13
would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would you therefore _refrain from marrying_? ^[Literally "Would you therefore let yourself be hindered to not belong to a man?"] No, my daughters, for it is far more bitter to me than _to_ you. For the hand of Yahweh has gone out against me."

###### v14
And they lifted up their voices and cried again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law _goodbye_, but Ruth clung to her.

###### v15
And she said, "Look, your sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods. Return after your sister-in-law _too_."

###### v16
But Ruth said, "_Do not urge_ ^[Literally "You shall not press me"] me to leave you _or_ to return from _following you_! ^[Literally "from behind you"] For where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people _will be_ my people and your God _will be_ my God.

###### v17
Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. So may Yahweh do to me, _and even more, unless_ ^[Literally "and so may he do again, that"] death _separates you and me_!" ^[Literally "makes a separation between you and between me"]

###### v18
_When Naomi_ saw that she was determined to go with her, _she said no more_. ^[Literally "she ceased to speak to her"]

###### v19
_So_ the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem. _And when they came_ ^[Literally "And it happened at the moment of coming"] to Bethlehem, all of the town was stirred because of them. And they said, "_Is_ this Naomi?"

###### v20
And she said to them, "You should not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for Shaddai ^[Often translated "the Almighty"] has _caused me to be very bitter_. ^[Literally "caused very bitterness to me"]

###### v21
I went _away_ full, but Yahweh brought me back empty-handed! Why call me Naomi _when Yahweh has testified against me_ ^[Literally "and Yahweh answered against me"] and Shaddai ^[Often translated "the Almighty"] has brought calamity upon me?"

###### v22
So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabite her daughter-in-law with her, returning from the countryside of Moab. And they came _to_ Bethlehem at _the_ beginning of _the_ harvest of barley.
