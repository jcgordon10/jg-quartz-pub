###### v1
_Now_ ^[Literally "and for"] Naomi _had a relative of her husband_, ^[Literally "was an acquaintance of a man of her husband"] _a prominent rich man_ ^[Literally "a man mighty of wealth"] from the clan of Elimelech, _whose_ name was Boaz.

###### v2
And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, "Please let me go _to_ the field and glean among the ears of grain after _someone_ in whose eyes I _may_ find favor." And she said to her, "Go, my daughter."

###### v3
So she went and came and gleaned in the field behind the reapers. And she happened _by_ chance _upon_ the tract of field _belonging to_ ^[Literally "was for"] Boaz, who _was_ from the clan of Elimelech.

###### v4
And look, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, "_May_ Yahweh _be_ with you." And they said to him, "_May_ Yahweh bless you."

###### v5
And Boaz said to his servant _in charge of the reapers_, ^[Literally "the one standing over the reapers"] "To whom _does_ this young woman _belong_?"

###### v6
And _the servant in charge of the reapers_ ^[Literally "the servant the one standing over the reapers"] said, "She _is_ a Moabite girl returning with Naomi from the countryside of Moab.

###### v7
And she said, 'Please let me glean and let me gather among the sheaves behind the reapers.' So she came and remained from the morning up to now. _She is sitting for a little while in the house_." ^[Literally "this one she is sitting a little in the house"]

###### v8
And Boaz said to Ruth, "_Listen carefully_, ^[Literally, "You have heard"] my daughter, go no longer to glean in another field. Moreover, do not leave from this one, but _stay close_ ^[Literally "cling"] with my young women.

###### v9
Keep your eyes on the field that they reap and go after them. Have I not ordered the servants not to bother you? And if you get thirsty, you shall go to the containers and drink from where the servants have drawn."

###### v10
And she fell on her face and bowed down to the ground and said to him, "Why have I found favor in your eyes by recognizing me--for I _am_ a foreigner?"

###### v11
And Boaz answered and said to her, "All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband was fully told to me. _How_ you left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and you went to a people that you did not know _before_. ^[Literally "yesterday three days ago"]

###### v12
May Yahweh reward your work and may a full reward be _given to_ you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you came to take refuge."

###### v13
And she said, "May I find favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and have spoken _kindly to your servant_, ^[Literally "on the heart of your servant"] and I am not one of your servants."

###### v14
And Boaz said to her _at mealtime_, ^[Literally "at the time of the food"] "Come here and eat from the bread and dip your morsel in the wine vinegar." So she sat beside the gleaners, and he offered to her roasted grain. And she ate and was satisfied, and she had some left over.

###### v15
And she got up to glean, and Boaz instructed his servants saying, "Let her also glean between the sheaves and do not reproach her.

###### v16
And also pull out for her from your bundles and leave _it_ so that she may glean--and do not rebuke her."

###### v17
So she gleaned in the field until the evening and she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah _of_ barley.

###### v18
And she picked _it_ up and went _to_ the town. Her mother-in-law saw how much she had gleaned. And she took _it_ out and gave to her what she had left over _after being satisfied_. ^[Literally "from her satiety"]

###### v19
And her mother-in-law said to her, "Where did you glean _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] and where did you work? May he _who_ took notice of you be blessed." And she told her mother-in-law _with whom she had worked_ ^[Literally "who she had worked with him"] and said, "The name of the man who I worked with today _is_ Boaz."

###### v20
And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "_May_ he be blessed by Yahweh, whose loyal love has not forsaken the living or the dead." And Naomi said to her, "The man is a close relative for us, he _is_ one of our redeemers."

###### v21
And Ruth the Moabite said, "Also, he said to me, 'You shall stay close with the servants which are mine until they have finished all of the harvest which is mine.'"

###### v22
And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "_It is_ good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidservants so that you will not _be bothered_ ^[Literally "they touch on you"] in another field."

###### v23
So she stayed close with the maidservants _of_ Boaz to glean until the end of the barley harvest and wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
