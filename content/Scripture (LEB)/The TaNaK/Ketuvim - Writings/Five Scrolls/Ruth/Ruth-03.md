###### v1
Now Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, should I not seek for you security that _things_ may be good for you?

###### v2
So then, _is_ not Boaz our kinsman whose maidservants you were with? Look, he _is_ winnowing the barley at the threshing floor tonight.

###### v3
Wash, anoint yourself, put your clothing on, and go down to the threshing floor. Do not make yourself known to the man until he finishes eating and drinking.

###### v4
And when he lies, take notice of the place where he lies. And you shall go and _uncover_ ^[Literally "open"] his feet and lie _down_, and he shall tell you what to do."

###### v5
And she said to her, "I will do all that you say."

###### v6
And she went down to the threshing floor and did all that her mother-in-law had instructed her.

###### v7
And Boaz ate and drank _until_ his heart was _merry_ ^[Literally "good"] _and then_ he came to lie at the end of the grain heap. And she came in quietly and _uncovered_ ^[Literally "opened"] his feet and lay down.

###### v8
And it happened in the middle of the night the man was startled and he reached out and behold, a woman _was_ lying at his feet.

###### v9
And he said, "Who _are_ you?" And she said, "I _am_ Ruth, your servant. Spread _your garment_ ^[Literally "your wing"] over your servant because you _are_ a redeemer."

###### v10
And he said, "You _are_ blessed by Yahweh my daughter. You did better _in this_ last kindness than the first by not going after young men, whether poor or rich.

###### v11
And so then my daughter, do not be afraid. All that you ask I will do for you, for the entire assembly of my people knows that you _are_ a worthy woman.

###### v12
Now truly I _am_ a redeemer, but there is also a redeemer _of a_ closer relationship than me.

###### v13
_Stay tonight,_ ^[Literally "Spend the night tonight"] and in the morning, if he wants to redeem you, good; but if he is not willing to redeem, _then as Yahweh lives,_ ^[Literally "the life of Yahweh"] I will redeem you. Lie down until the morning."

###### v14
So she lay at his feet until morning and got up before _anyone could recognize each other_. ^[Literally "a man could recognize his friend"] And he said, "It must not be known that _you_ ^[Literally "the woman"] came _to_ the threshing floor."

###### v15
And he said, "Bring the cloak that _is_ on you and _hold it out_." ^[Literally "hold on her"] And she held it out and he measured six _measures of_ barley and put it on her _cloak_. Then she went _into_ the city.

###### v16
And she came to her mother-in-law, and she said, "_How did it go for you,_ ^[Literally "who are you?"] my daughter?" And she told her all that the man did for her.

###### v17
And she said, "These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, 'You shall not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.'"

###### v18
And she said, "Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest but will settle the matter today."
