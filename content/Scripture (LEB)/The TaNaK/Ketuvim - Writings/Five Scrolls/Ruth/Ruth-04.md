[[Ruth-03|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
And Boaz had gone up _to_ the _city_ gate and sat there. And look, the redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken _was_ passing by. And he said, "Come over here to sit, _friend_." ^[Literally "certain someone"] And he came over and sat.

###### v2
And he took ten men from the elders of the city and said, "Sit here." And they sat.

###### v3
And he said to the redeemer, "Naomi, who returned from the countryside _of_ Moab, is selling the tract of land which _was_ for our brother Elimelech.

###### v4
And I thought _I would tell you_ ^[Literally "I would open your ear"] and say, '_Buy it in the presence of_ ^[Literally "Buy before"] those sitting and before the elders of my people,' if you want to redeem _it_, redeem _it_. But if you do not want to redeem, tell me so that I may know, for there is no one except you to redeem _it_, and I _am_ after you." And he said, "I want to redeem _it_."

###### v5
And Boaz said, "On the day of your acquiring the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the wife of the dead _man_, _in order_ to raise up _for_ the name of the dead his inheritance."

###### v6
And the redeemer said, "I am not able to redeem for myself, lest I ruin my inheritance. You redeem for yourself my kinsman-redemption, for I am not able to redeem _it_."

###### v7
(Now this _was the custom in former times_ ^[Literally "before faces"] in Israel concerning the kinsman-redemption and transfer of property: to confirm the matter, a man removed his sandal and gave _it_ to his fellow countryman. This _was_ the manner of attesting in Israel.)

###### v8
So the redeemer said to Boaz, "Acquire _it_ for yourself," and he removed his sandal.

###### v9
And Boaz said to the elders and all of the people, "You _are_ witnesses today that I have acquired all that _was_ for Elimelech and that _was_ for Kilion and Mahlon from the hand of Naomi.

###### v10
And also Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, I have acquired as a wife, to raise up the name of the dead over his inheritance, so that the name of the dead may not be cut off from his relatives and from the gate of his _birth_ place. You _are_ witnesses today."

###### v11
And all of the people who _were_ at the gate and the elders said, "_We are_ witnesses. May Yahweh make the woman coming into your house as Rachel and as Leah, who _together_ ^[Literally "the two of them"] built the house of Israel. May you have strength in Ephrathah and bestow a name in Bethlehem.

###### v12
And may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah from the offspring that Yahweh will give to you from this young woman."

###### v13
So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. And he went _in_ to her, and Yahweh _enabled her to conceive_, ^[Literally "gave to her conception"] and she bore a son.

###### v14
And the women said to Naomi, "Blessed be Yahweh who today _did not leave you without a redeemer_! ^[Literally "did not allow to be missing for you a redeemer"] And may his name be renowned in Israel!

###### v15
He shall be for you a restorer of life and a sustainer in your old age, for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who _is_ better for you than seven sons, has borne him."

###### v16
And Naomi took the child and she put him on her bosom and became his nurse.

###### v17
And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, "A son has been born to Naomi." And they called his name Obed. He _was_ the father of Jesse, the father of David.

###### v18
Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron,

###### v19
and Hezron fathered Ram, and Ram fathered Amminadab,

###### v20
and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,

###### v21
and Salmon fathered Boaz, and Boaz fathered Obed,

###### v22
and Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.
