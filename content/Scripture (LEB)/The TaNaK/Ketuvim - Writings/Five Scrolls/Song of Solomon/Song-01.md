[[Song-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
The Song of Songs, ^[This construction conveys a superlative connotation, e.g., "The most exquisite song"] which _is_ for ^[Or "by Solomon" or "about/concerning Solomon"] Solomon.

###### v2
_May ^[In the maiden's soliloquy, she thinks about her beloved in her thoughts ("May he kiss me!"), then poetically speaks to him as if he were in her presence ("for your love is better than wine"). To avoid confusion, the translation uses the second-person form throughout vv. [[Song-01#v2|2–4]][[Song-01#v3|]][[Song-01#v4|]]] you kiss me_ ^[Literally "May he kiss me"] _passionately with your lips_, ^[Literally "with the kisses of his mouth"]
for your love _is_ better than wine. ^[The shift from the third person "he … his" to the second person "you … your" in vv. [[Song-01#v2|2–4]][[Song-01#v3|]][[Song-01#v4|]] should not be interpreted as suggesting two different referents, that is, one male whom the maiden is addressing as "you," and another to whom she refers as "he." Rather, this shift is a poetic device (called "grammatical differentiation") that is not uncommon in Hebrew poetry (e.g., [[Gen-49#v4|Gen 49:4]]; [[Deut-32#v15|Deut 32:15]]; [[Ps-23#v2|Psa 23:2–5]][[Ps-23#v3|]][[Ps-23#v4|]][[Ps-23#v5|]]; [[Isa-01#v29|Isa 1:29]]; [[Isa-42#v20|42:20]]; [[Isa-54#v1|54:1]]; [[Jer-22#v24|Jer 22:24]]; [[Amos-04#v1|Amos 4:1]]; [[Mic-07#v19|Mic 7:19]]; [[Lam-03#v1|Lam 3:1]]; [[Song-04#v2|Song 4:2]]; [[Song-06#v6|6:6]]). This shift is characteristic of a soliloquy, a dramatic or literary form in which a character reveals her thoughts without addressing a listener who is actually present (e.g., [[2 Sam-19#v4|2 Sam 19:4]]). In this case, the maiden's private thoughts about her beloved (v. [[Song-01#v2|2a]]) shift to an imaginary address to her beloved (vv. [[Song-01#v2|2b–4a]][[Song-01#v3|]][[Song-01#v4|]])]

###### v3
As fragrance, _your perfumes_ ^[Literally "your oil lotions"] _are_ _delightful_; ^[Literally "good"]
your name is poured out _perfume_; ^[Literally "oil lotion"]
therefore young women love you.

###### v4
Draw me after you, let us run!
May the king bring me into his chambers! ^[Or "The king has brought me into his chambers"]
Let us be joyful and let us rejoice in you;
let us extol your love more than wine.
Rightly do they love you!

###### v5
I _am_ black but beautiful, ^[Or "black and beautiful"] _O maidens of Jerusalem_, ^[Literally "O daughters of Jerusalem"]
like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.

###### v6
Do not gaze at me because I am black,  ^[This is figurative for the maiden's physical appearance; her skin was darkly tanned]
because the sun has stared _at_ me.
The sons of my mother were angry with me;
they made me keeper of the vineyards,
_but_ my own "vineyard" ^[Literally "my vineyard that for me"] I did not keep.

###### v7
Tell me, _you_ whom my _heart_ ^[Literally "soul"] loves,
where do you pasture your flock,
where do your sheep lie down at the noon?
_For why should I be like_ ^[Literally "For to what will I be like"] one who is veiled ^[The reading of the MT ("like one who is veiled") is supported by the LXX. However, several ancient versions (Syriac Peshitta, Latin Vulgate, Symmachus) reflect an alternate Hebrew textual tradition in which two letters are transposed, resulting in the reading "like one who wanders about." This makes good sense contextually, since the maiden does not know where her beloved would be at noon]
beside the flocks of your companions?

###### v8
If you do not know, O fairest among women,
follow _the tracks_ ^[Literally "in the tracks"] of the flock,
and pasture your little lambs ^[Or "your kids"] beside the tents of the shepherds.

###### v9
To a mare ^[Or "my mare"] among the chariots ^[Or "chariot horses"] of Pharaoh,
I compare you, my beloved.

###### v10
Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments,
your neck with strings of jewels.

###### v11
We will make ornaments of gold for you
with studs ^[Or "droplets"] of silver.

###### v12
While the king _was_ on his couch,
my nard gave its fragrance.

###### v13
My beloved _is_ to me _a pouch_ ^[Literally "the bag"] of myrrh,
he spends the night ^[Or "he lays"] between my breasts.

###### v14
My beloved _is_ to me a cluster of blossoms of henna
in the vineyards of En Gedi.

###### v15
Look! You _are_ beautiful, my beloved.
Look! You _are_ beautiful;
your eyes _are_ doves.

###### v16
Look! You _are_ beautiful, my beloved,
truly pleasant.
Truly our couch _is_ _verdant_; ^[Literally "green"]

###### v17
    the beams of our house _are_ cedar;
our rafter _is_ cypress.
