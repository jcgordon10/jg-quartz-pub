[[Song-01|Previous Chapter]] | [[Song-03|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
I _am_ a rose ^[More likely "meadow saffron" or "crocus." Hebrew scholars and botanists suggest the term refers to _Ashodelos_ (lily family), _Narcissus tazetta_ (narcissus or daffodil), or _Colchicum autumnale_ (meadow saffron or crocus) (e.g., [[Isa-35#v1|Isa 35:1]]). The location of this flower in Sharon suggests a common wild flower rather than a rose. The maiden compares herself to a simple, common flower of the field] of Sharon,
a lily of the valleys.

###### v2
Like a lily among the thorns, ^[Or "brambles"]
so _is_ my love among the maidens.

###### v3
As an apple tree among the trees of the forest,
so _is_ my beloved among the young men.
In his shade _I sat down with delight_, ^[Literally "I sat down and I delighted"]
and his fruit _was_ sweet to my palate.

###### v4
He brought me to the house of the wine,
and his intention _was_ love toward me.

###### v5
Sustain me with the raisins,
refresh me with the apples,
_for I _am_ lovesick_. ^[Literally "for I myself _am_ sick with love"]

###### v6
His left _hand_ _is_ under my head,
and his right _hand_ embraces ^[Or "would embrace me"] me.

###### v7
I adjure you, _O maidens of Jerusalem_, ^[Literally "O daughters of Jerusalem"]
by the gazelles or by the does of the field,
do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases! ^[Or "Do not stir up or awaken the love until it is willing," or "Do not disturb or interrupt _our_ lovemaking until it is satisfied"]

###### v8
The voice of my beloved!
Look! Here _he_ ^[Literally "this one"] comes leaping upon the mountains,
bounding over the hills!

###### v9
My beloved is like a gazelle or _a young stag_. ^[Literally "the fawn of the stag"]
Look! _He is_ ^[Literally "This _is he_"] standing behind our wall,
gazing _through_ ^[Literally "from"] the window,
looking _through_ ^[Literally "from"] the lattice.

###### v10
My beloved answered and said to me,
"_Arise_, ^[Literally "Arise, you"] my beloved! _Come, my beauty_! ^[Literally "And come, you"]

###### v11
For look! The winter is over;
_the rainy season_ ^[Literally "the rain"] _has turned and gone away_. ^[Literally "is over; it is gone"]

###### v12
The blossoms _appear_ ^[Literally "is seen"] _in the land_; ^[Literally "on the earth"]
_the time of singing ^[Most likely, a subtle word play occurs here since there are two different words in Hebrew spelled the same way: "pruning" and "singing." The former plays upon the first line and the latter upon the third line] has arrived_; ^[Literally "the time of the song arrived"]
the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.

###### v13
The fig tree puts forth her figs,
and the vines _are in_ blossom; they give fragrance.
_Arise_, ^[Literally "Arise, to you!"] my beloved! _Come, my beauty_!" ^[Literally "My beauty, come, you"]

###### v14
My dove, in the clefts of the rock,
_in the secluded place_ ^[Literally "in the secret place"] ^[Or "in the covering"] _in the mountain_, ^[Literally "foothold in the rock"] ^[Or "cliff"]
Let me see your face,
let me hear your voice;
for your voice _is_ sweet and your face _is_ lovely.

###### v15
Catch for us the foxes,
the little foxes destroying vineyards,
for ^[Or "while"] our vineyards _are in_ blossom!

###### v16
_My beloved belongs to me and I belong to him_; ^[Literally "My beloved for me and I for him"]
he pastures his flock among the lilies.

###### v17
Until the day breathes and the shadows flee,
turn, my beloved!
_Be like_ ^[Literally "Be like for you"] a gazelle ^[Or "a buck gazelle"] or _young stag_ ^[Literally "the fawn of the stag"] on the cleft mountains. ^[Or "the mountains of Bether"]
