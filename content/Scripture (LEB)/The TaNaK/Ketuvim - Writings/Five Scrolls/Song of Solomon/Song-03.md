###### v1
On my bed in the night,
I sought ^[Or "I seek"] him whom my _heart_ ^[Literally "soul"] loves.
I sought him, but I did not find him.

###### v2
Now I will arise, and I will go about in the city,
in the streets and in the squares;
I will seek him whom my _heart_ ^[Literally "soul"] loves.
I sought him, but I did not find him.

###### v3
The sentinels who go about in the city found me.
"Have you seen the one whom my _heart_ ^[Literally "soul"] loves?"

###### v4
_Scarcely had I passed_ ^[Literally "As little that I passed"] by them
when I found him whom my _heart_ ^[Literally "soul"] loves.
I held him and I would not let him go
until I brought him to the house of my mother,
into the bedroom chamber of she who conceived me.

###### v5
I adjure you, _O maidens of Jerusalem_, ^[Literally "O daughters of Jerusalem"]
by the gazelles or by the does of the field,
do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases! ^[Or "Do not stir up or awaken the love until it is willing," or "Do not disturb or interrupt _our_ love-making until it is satisfied"]

###### v6
What _is_ this coming up from the desert
like a column of smoke,
perfumed with myrrh and frankincense
from all the fragrant powders of the merchant?

###### v7
Look! _It is_ Solomon's _portable couch_! ^[Literally "couch" or "portable sedan chair"]
Sixty mighty men surround _it_, ^[Literally "her"]
the mighty men of Israel.

###### v8
All of them _wield swords_; ^[Literally "holders of sword"]
_they are_ _trained in warfare_, ^[Literally "learnt of war"]
each with his sword at his thigh
_to guard_ _against terror_ ^[Literally "because of the fear"] in the night.

###### v9
_King Solomon_ ^[Literally "The king, Solomon"] made for himself a sedan chair
from the wood of Lebanon.

###### v10
He made its column of silver, its back ^[Or "its support," "its base," "its headrest," "its litter," "its cover"] of gold, its seat of purple;
its interior is inlaid _with_ leather ^[Or "love." The Hebrew term here translated "leather" is spelled the same as the term for "love." Most likely this is an example of a word play that puns on the intentional ambiguity: "Its interior was inlaid with leather//love by the maidens of Jerusalem"] by _the maidens of Jerusalem_. ^[Literally "by the daughters of Jerusalem"]

###### v11
Come out and look, _O maidens of Zion_, ^[Literally "O daughters of Zion"] at _King Solomon_, ^[Literally "the king, Solomon"]
at the crown with which his mother crowned him
on the day of his wedding,
on the day of the joy of his heart!
