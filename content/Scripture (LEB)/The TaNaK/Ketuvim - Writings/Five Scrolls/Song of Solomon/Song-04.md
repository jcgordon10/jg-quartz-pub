###### v1
_Oh my_! ^[Literally "Behold!" Or "Look!"] You _are_ beautiful, my beloved!
_Oh my_! ^[Literally "Behold!" Or "Look!"] You _are_ beautiful!
Your eyes _are_ doves
from behind your veil.
Your hair _is_ like a flock of goats
that move down from the mountains of Gilead.

###### v2
Your teeth _are_ like a flock of shorn ewes
that came up from the washing,
all of them bearing twins,
and there is none bereaved among them.

###### v3
Your lips _are_ like a thread of crimson,
and your mouth _is_ lovely.
Your temple _is_ like pomegranate
from behind your veil.

###### v4
Your neck _is_ like the tower of David,
built in courses;
a thousand _ornaments_ ^[Literally "shields"] are hung on it,
all the shields of the warriors.

###### v5
Your two breasts _are_ like two fawns,
twins of a gazelle that feed among the lilies.

###### v6
Until the day breathes and the shadows flee,
I will go to the mountain of the myrrh,
to the hill of the frankincense.

###### v7
You _are_ completely beautiful, my beloved!
_You are flawless_! ^[Literally "There is no flaw in you!"]

###### v8
Come ^[Or "You must come"] with me from Lebanon, my bride!
Come with me ^[Or "With me"] from Lebanon!
Look from the top of Amana,
from the top of Senir and Hermon,
from the dwelling places of the lions,
from the mountains of leopard.

###### v9
You have stolen (my) heart, my sister bride!
You have stolen _my_ heart with one _glance_ from your eyes,
with one ornament from your necklaces.

###### v10
How beautiful is your love, my sister bride!
How better is your love than wine,
and the fragrance of your oils than any spice!

###### v11
Your lips drip nectar, _my_ bride;
honey and milk _are_ under your lips;
the scent of your garments _is_ like the scent of Lebanon.

###### v12
A garden locked _is_ my sister bride,
a spring enclosed, ^[Or "a source locked"] a fountain sealed.

###### v13
Your shoots ^[Or "your channel"] _are_ an orchard of pomegranates with _choice fruit_, ^[Literally "fruit of choice things"]
henna with nard;

###### v14
nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon spice with all trees of frankincense,
myrrh and aloes with all chief spices.

###### v15
A garden fountain, a well of living water,
flowing (streams) from Lebanon.

###### v16
Awake, O north wind! Come, O south wind!
Blow upon my garden! Let its fragrances ^[Or "perfumes"] waft forth! ^[Or "His perfumes can waft down"]
Let my beloved come to his garden,
let him eat his choice fruit!
