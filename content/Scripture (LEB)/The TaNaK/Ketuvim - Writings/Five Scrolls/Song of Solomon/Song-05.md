###### v1
I have come to my garden, my sister bride,
I have gathered my myrrh with my spice,
I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey,
I have drunk my wine with my milk!
Eat, O friends! _Drink and become drunk _with_ love_! ^[Or "Drink and become drunk, O lovers!"]

###### v2
I _was_ asleep but ^[Or "and"] my heart was awake.
A sound! My beloved knocking! ^[Or "The sound of my beloved knocking!"]
"Open to me, my sister, my beloved,
my dove, my perfect one!
For my head is full of dew,
_my hair drenched from the moist night air_." ^[Literally "my locks with drops of night"]

###### v3
I have taken off my tunic, _must I put it on_? ^[Literally "How will I put it on?"]
I have bathed my feet, _must I soil them_? ^[Literally "How will I soil them?"]

###### v4
My beloved thrust his hand into the opening,
and my inmost yearned for him.

###### v5
I myself arose to open to my beloved;
my hands dripped with myrrh,
my fingers with liquid myrrh
upon the handles of the bolt.

###### v6
I opened myself to my beloved,
but my beloved had turned and gone; ^[Or "my beloved had left; he was gone"]
my heart sank ^[Or "my soul left"] when he turned away. ^[Or "when he was speaking." Translations equivocate on how to translate this verb, since there are two terms in Hebrew spelled identically: "to speak" and "to turn aside" (HALOT 1:210). The context suggests the latter]
I sought him, but I did not find him;
I called him, but he did not answer me.

###### v7
The sentinels making rounds in the city found me;
they beat me, they wounded me;
they took my cloak ^[Or "mantle"] away from me--
_those sentinels on the walls_! ^[Literally "the sentinels of the walls"]

###### v8
I adjure you, _O maidens of Jerusalem_, ^[Literally "O daughters of Jerusalem"]
if you find my beloved, what will you tell him?
_Tell him_ that I am _lovesick_! ^[Literally "sick _with_ love"]

###### v9
_How is your beloved better than another lover_, ^[Literally "What _is_ your beloved more than _another_ beloved …?"]
O most beautiful among women?
_How is your beloved better than another lover_,  ^[Literally "What _is_ your beloved more than _another_ beloved …?"]
that you adjure us thus?

###### v10
My beloved _is_ radiant and _ruddy_, ^[Literally "red"]
distinguished _among_ ^[Literally "more than"] ten thousand.

###### v11
His head _is_ gold, refined gold;
his locks _are_ wavy, black as a raven.

###### v12
His eyes _are_ like doves beside springs ^[Or "streams"] of water,
bathed in milk, _set like mounted jewels_. ^[Literally "dwelling in a setting"] ^[Or "seated at a _suitable_ mounting"]

###### v13
His cheeks _are_ like beds of spice, a tower of fragrances;
his lips _are_ lilies dripping liquid myrrh.

###### v14
His arms _are_ _rods_ ^[Literally "cylinders"] ^[Or "rings"] of gold _engraved with_ ^[Literally "filled with"] jewels;
his belly ^[Or "body"] _is_ polished ivory covered with sapphires. ^[Or "works of ivory set with sapphire"]

###### v15
His legs _are_ columns of alabaster, ^[Or "marble"] set on bases of gold;
his appearance _is_ like Lebanon, choice as _its cedars_. ^[Literally "the cedars"]

###### v16
_His mouth_ ^[Or "his palate"] _is_ sweet,
and he is altogether desirable.
This _is_ my beloved;
this _is_ my friend, _O young women of Jerusalem_. ^[Literally "O daughters of Jerusalem"]
