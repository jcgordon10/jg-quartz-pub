###### v1
Where has your beloved gone,
O most beautiful among women?
Where has your beloved turned
that we may seek him with you?

###### v2
My beloved has gone down to his garden,
to the garden bed of the spice,
to pasture his flock and to gather lilies in the garden.

###### v3
_I belong to my beloved and he belongs to me_; ^[Literally "I for my beloved and he for me"]
he pastures his flock among the lilies.

###### v4
You _are_ beautiful, my beloved, as Tirzah,
lovely as Jerusalem,
_overwhelming as an army with banners_. ^[Literally "terrible as the bannered ones"]

###### v5
Turn away your eyes from before me,
for they overwhelm me.
Your hair _is_ like a flock of the goats
that moves down from Gilead.

###### v6
Your teeth _are_ like a flock of the ewes
that have come up from the washing,
all of them bearing twins,
and there is none bereaved among them.

###### v7
Your cheeks _behind_ ^[Literally "from behind"] your veil
_are_ like halves of a pomegranate.

###### v8
Sixty queens there _are_, eighty concubines,
and maidens beyond number.

###### v9
My dove, _she is the one_; ^[Literally "she _is_ one"] ^[The term "one" functions here as an adjective of quality: "unique, singular, the only one"]
my perfect, _she is the only one_; ^[Literally "she _is_ one"] ^[Or "the only daughter of her mother." Although the latter option is permissible, the term is used elsewhere of the heir as the favored child (e.g., [[Gen-22#v2|Gen 22:2]]; [[Prov-04#v3|Prov 4:3]]). This nuance is supported by the parallel term "favorite"]
she _is_ _the favorite of_ ^[Or "she _is_ the pure one." Since there are two Hebrew terms spelled the same way, some relate this to the adjective that means "pure." Others relate it to the verb that means "to choose, select." The parallelism favors the latter] ^[Literally "the favorite for"] her mother who bore her.
Maidens see her and consider her fortunate; ^[Or "call her happy" or "call her blessed" or "bless her"]
queens and concubines praise her:

###### v10
"Who _is_ this that looks down like the dawn,
beautiful as the moon,
_bright as the sun_, ^[Literally "pure as the glow"] ^[Or "bright as the heat of the sun." The Hebrew term "glow" poetically refers to the bright rays of the sun ([[Ps-19#v7|Psa 19:7]]; [[Isa-24#v23|Isa 24:23]]; [[Isa-30#v26|30:26]])]
_overwhelming as an army with banners_?" ^[Literally "terrible as the bannered ones"]

###### v11
I went down to the orchard of the walnut trees
to look at the blossoms of the valley,
to see _whether_ the vine_s_ have sprouted,
_whether_ the pomegranates have blossomed.

###### v12
I did not know my _heart_ ^[Literally "soul"] set me
_in_ a chariot of my princely people. ^[Or "Before I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib" (KJV, ASV) or "Before I knew it, my desire set me mid the chariots of Ammi-nadib" (JPS) or "Before I was aware, my soul set me over the chariots of my noble people" (NASB) or "Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people" (NIV) or "… among the chariots of Amminadab" (NIV margin) or "… among the chariots of the people of the prince" (NIV margin)]

###### v13
 ^[[[Song-06#v13|Song of Songs 6:13–7:13]] in the English Bible is 7:1–14 in the Hebrew Bible] Turn, turn, ^[Or "Return, return …!"] O Shulammite! ^[Or "O perfect one," "O peaceful one," "O bride." Many interpreters take this moniker as suggesting the maiden was from the village of Shulem (alternately called Shunem)]
Turn, turn ^[Or "Return, return …!"] so that we may look upon you!
Why do you look upon the Shulammite
as _at_ a dance of the two armies?
