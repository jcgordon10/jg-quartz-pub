[[Song-06|Previous Chapter]] | [[Song-08|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
How beautiful are your feet in sandals,
O royal princess! ^[Or "O daughter of leader"]
The curves of your _thighs_ ^[Literally "thigh"] _are_ like _jewels_, ^[Literally "ornaments"]
the work of the hands of a craftsman.

###### v2
Your navel _is_ _a round wine-mixing bowl_ ^[Literally "a bowl of the roundness"]
that does not lack mixed ^[Or "blended"] wine!
Your belly _is_ a heap of wheat
encircled with lilies.

###### v3
Your two breasts _are_ like two fawns,
twins of a gazelle.

###### v4
Your neck _is_ like a tower of ivory;
your eyes _are_ pools in Heshbon at the gate of Beth Rabbim.
Your nose _is_ like the tower of Lebanon
_looking out over Damascus_. ^[Literally "looking out over the face of Damascus"]

###### v5
_Your head crowns you like Carmel_; ^[Literally "Your head _is_ on you like the Carmel"] ^[Because of its height and fertility, Mount Carmel is often associated with royalty]
the flowing locks of your head _are_ like _purple tapestry_; ^[Literally "the purple"]
a king is held captive in the tresses!

###### v6
How beautiful you are and how pleasant,
O loved one in the delights!

###### v7
_Your stature_ ^[Literally "this your height"] _is_ like the palm tree,
and your breasts _are_ like clusters.

###### v8
I say, "I will climb up the palm tree;
I will lay hold of its fruit clusters."
Let your breasts _be pleasing_ like clusters of the vine
and the scent of your breath like the apples.

###### v9
Your palate _is_ like the best wine that goes down for my beloved,
smoothly gliding over my lips and teeth. ^[Or "over lips of sleepers." One Hebrew textual tradition preserves the reading "lips of those who sleep" (MT). Another Hebrew tradition reads "my lips and my teeth," as reflected by the ancient versions (LXX, Latin Vulgate, Aramaic Targum, Syriac Peshitta). The latter is adopted here since it makes the most sense poetically]

###### v10
_I belong to my beloved_, ^[Literally "I _am_ for my beloved"]
_and he desires me_! ^[Literally "and his desire _is_ for me." Or "and his desire belongs to me"]

###### v11
Come, my beloved, let us _go out to the countryside_; ^[Literally "go forth into the field"]
let us spend the night ^[Or "lodge"] in the villages.

###### v12
Let us rise early _to go_ ^[Or "let us go"] to the vineyards;
let us see whether the vine has budded, ^[Or "sprouted"]
_whether_ the grape blossom has opened,
and _whether_ the pomegranates _are in bloom_; ^[Literally "have bloomed"]
there I will give my love to you.

###### v13
The mandrakes give _off their_ fragrance,
and _over our doorway is every kind of delicious fruit_; ^[Or "over our doorways all choice _things_"]
both _fresh and dried fruit I have stored up_ ^[Literally "new also old I have laid up"] for you, O my beloved.
