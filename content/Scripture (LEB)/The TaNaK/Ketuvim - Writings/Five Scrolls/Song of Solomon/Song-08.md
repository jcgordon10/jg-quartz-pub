[[Song-07|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
_How I wish that you were my little brother_, ^[Literally "O that he would give you like a brother to me"] ^[The Hebrew construction (which is somewhat misleading if rendered in a woodenly literal sense) is an idiom expressing one's fanciful wish]
_who_ nursed _upon my mother's breasts_! ^[Literally "at the breast of my mother"]
_If_ _I met you outside_, ^[Literally "I will find you in the street"] I would kiss you,
_and no one would despise me_! ^[Literally "also they would not despise me"]

###### v2
_I would surely bring you_ ^[Literally "I would lead you and I would bring you"] ^[The combination of the two verbs creates a hendiadys which may be rendered more cogently as "I would surely bring you …"] to the house of my mother,
_who would surely teach me_; ^[Literally "she will teach me"]
_I would give you spiced wine to drink_, ^[Literally "I would give you to drink from the wine of the spice"]
the _sweet wine_ ^[Or "juice"] of my pomegranates. ^[The traditional Hebrew reads the singular "my pomegranate." However, the plural reading "my pomegranates" is attested in numerous medieval Hebrew manuscripts and is reflected in the ancient versions (Greek Septuagint, Aramaic Targum, Syriac Peshitta). The latter makes the most sense in this context as a euphemistic description of the maiden's delights]

###### v3
His left _hand is_ under my head,
and his right _hand_ embraces ^[Or "embraced"] me.

###### v4
I adjure you, _O maidens of Jerusalem_, ^[Literally "O daughters of Jerusalem"]
do not ^[Or "Why must you … before it pleases?"] arouse or awaken love until it pleases! ^[Or "Do not stir up or awaken the love until it is willing," or "Do not disturb or interrupt _our_ lovemaking until it is satisfied"]

###### v5
Who _is_ this coming up from the wilderness,
leaning upon her beloved?
Under the apple tree I awakened you;
there your mother _conceived you_; ^[Literally "was in labor with you"]
there she who was in labor gave birth to you.

###### v6
Set me as a seal upon your heart,
as a seal upon your arm;
for love _is_ strong as death;
passion _is_ fierce as Sheol;
its flashes _are_ flashes of fire;
_it is_ a blazing flame.

###### v7
Many waters cannot quench love;
rivers cannot sweep it away. ^[Or "and rivers cannot engulf it"]
If a man were to give all the wealth of his house _for love_, ^[Literally "in the love"]
he would be utterly scorned. ^[Literally "they will utterly scorn him"]

###### v8
_We have a little sister_, ^[Literally "a little sister for us"]
_and she does not yet have any breasts_. ^[Literally "and there is no breast for her"]
What should we do for our sister
_on the day when she is betrothed_? ^[Literally "on the day when it is spoken of her"] ^[Or "on the day when she is spoken for"]

###### v9
If she _is_ a wall,
_we will adorn her with a turret of silver_; ^[Literally "we will build upon her a camp of silver"] ^[The term translated "turret" refers to the decorative parapet adorning the top of a building. This image is likely figurative for a silver tiara set upon the head]
but if she _is_ a door,
we will barricade her with boards of cedar. ^[Or "we will enclose her"]

###### v10
I _was_ a wall, and my breasts _were_ like the towers,
_so _my betrothed_ viewed me with great delight_. ^[Literally "then I was in his eyes as _one who_ finds peace"]

###### v11
_Solomon had a vineyard_ ^[Literally "A vineyard was for Solomon"] at Baal-hamon;
_he entrusted his vineyard to the keepers_; ^[Literally "he gave the vineyard to the keepers"]
_people paid a thousand silver _pieces_ for its fruit_. ^[Literally "each one brought a thousand silver _pieces_ for his fruit"]

###### v12
_My own "vineyard" belongs to me_; ^[Literally "My vineyard that for me before my face"]
the "thousand" are for you, O Solomon,
_and "two hundred" for those who tend its fruit_. ^[Literally "and two hundred for _the_ keepers _of_ his fruit"]

###### v13
O you who dwell in the garden,
_my_ companions are listening to your voice.
Let me hear _it_!

###### v14
Flee, my beloved!
_Be like a gazelle_ ^[Literally "and be like for you to a gazelle"] or _a young stag_ ^[Literally "to the fawn of the stag"]
upon _the perfumed mountains_! ^[Literally "the mountains of spices"]
