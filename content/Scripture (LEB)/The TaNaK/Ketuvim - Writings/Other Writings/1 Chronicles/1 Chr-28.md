###### v1
Then David assembled all the commanders of Israel, the commanders of the tribes and the commanders of working groups who served the king, and the commanders of thousands, the commanders of hundreds, and the commanders over all the property of the king and his sons, with the court officials and mighty warriors, and all the mighty warriors of ability, at Jerusalem.

###### v2
And King David rose to his feet and said, "Listen to me, my brothers and my people. _I myself wanted_ ^[Literally "I myself with my heart"] to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the footstool of our God, and I prepared to build.

###### v3
But God said to me, 'You may not build a house for my name because you _are_ a man of war, and you have shed blood.'

###### v4
But Yahweh the God of Israel chose me from all of the house of my father to be king over Israel forever, for he chose Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to reign over all Israel.

###### v5
And from all my sons--for Yahweh has given many sons to me--he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of Yahweh over Israel.

###### v6
And he said to me, 'Solomon your son, he himself shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him as a son to myself, and I myself will be as a father to him,

###### v7
and I will establish his kingdom forever if _he firmly performs_ ^[Literally "if he is strong to do"] my commandments and my judgments as _he has to_ this day.'

###### v8
So now in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek all the commandments of Yahweh your God so that you may take possession of this good land and bestow _it_ as an inheritance to your children after you forever."

###### v9
"And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and a willing mind, for Yahweh searches all hearts and understands every plan and _all_ thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you forever.

###### v10
Look now, for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong and do it!"

Then David gave to Solomon his son the plan of the vestibule and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, its inner chambers, and of the house of the lid of the ark,

###### v12
and the plan of all _that he had in mind_ ^[Literally "that was in the spirit with him"] for the courtyards of the house of Yahweh and for all the surrounding storage rooms, the treasuries of the house of God, and the treasuries for sanctified objects,

and for the working groups of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh, and for all the vessels for the service of the house of Yahweh,

###### v14
_and_ for the gold, according to the weight of the gold for all the vessels of the service, and the service of all the vessels of silver according to the weight of all the vessels _for every kind of service_. ^[Literally "service and service"]

###### v15
And the weight of the golden lampstands and the golden lamps, _the weight of each lampstand and each lamp_, ^[Literally "by weight of lampstand and lampstand, with its lamp and to the lamps"] _and_ the silver according to the weight of a lampstand and its lamp, according to the use of _each lampstand_, ^[Literally "lampstand and lampstand"]

###### v20
Then David said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and courageous, and do _this_! Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed, for Yahweh God, my God, _is_ with you. He will not fail you and will not forsake you until all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh is finished.

###### v21
And behold, the working groups of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work for all _those_ willing with the skill for every service, and the commanders and all the people for all your commands."
