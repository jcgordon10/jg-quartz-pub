And the Lord gave Jehoiakim the king of Judah into his hand and _some of_ ^[Literally "from the end/extremity/limits"] of the utensils of the temple of God, ^[Hebrew "the God"] and he brought them _to_ the land of Shinar _to_ the temple of his gods, and he brought the utensils to _the treasury_ ^[Literally "the house of the treasury"] of his gods.

###### v3
And the king _ordered_ ^[Literally "said to"] Ashpenaz, the commander of his court officials, to bring _some of the Israelites_ ^[Literally "from the sons/children of Israel"] from _the royal family_ ^[Literally "from the seed of the kingship"] and from the lords, ^[Or "nobles"]

###### v4
youths who _have no physical defect_, ^[Literally "there is not in them any physical defect"] and _who are_ _handsome_, ^[Literally "good/pleasing of appearance"] and _who are_ prudent ^[Or "insightful"] in all wisdom and _endowed with knowledge_, ^[Literally "_who have_ knowledge of knowledge"] and _who_ understand insight, and who _have_ the _ability_ ^[Literally "strength"] in them to serve in the palace of the king. _And the king ordered him_ to teach them the literature and the language of _the_ Chaldeans.

###### v5
And the king assigned to them _his daily portion_ ^[Literally "_the_ portion of the day on its day"] from the fine food of the king, and from _the wine that he drank_, ^[Literally "the wine of his drink"] and _instructed that_ _they were to be educated for three years_. ^[Literally "and to be educated them years three"] And at the end _of_ their _training_, _they were to be stationed_ ^[Literally "they would stand"] _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the king.

###### v6
Now there was among them _from the Judeans_, ^[Literally "from the children of Judah"] Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.

###### v7
And the commander of the court officials gave them names, and he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; and Hananiah, Shadrach; and Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego.

###### v8
Now _Daniel resolved_ ^[Literally "Daniel placed upon his heart"] that he would not defile himself with the fine food of the king, and with _the wine that he drank_, ^[Literally "the wine of his drink"] and _so_ he requested from the commander of the court officials _permission so_ that he would not defile himself.

###### v9
And God ^[Hebrew "the God"] gave Daniel favor and compassion _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the commander of the court officials,

###### v10
and the commander of the court officials said to Daniel, "I _am_ afraid _of_ my lord, the king, who has determined your food and your drink, for _why should_ ^[Literally "to what would"] he see your face having a worse appearance than the young men who _are your age_? ^[Literally "like your age"; "your" is plural] Then you will endanger my head with the king."

###### v11
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Daniel asked the guard ^[Or "overseer"] whom the commander of the court officials _had_ appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,

###### v12
"Please test your servants _for_ ten days, and let them give us _some of the vegetables_, ^[Literally "from the vegetables"] and let us eat and let us drink water.

###### v13
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] let our appearances and the appearance of the young men who are eating the fine food of the king be compared _before you_, ^[Literally "in your presence"] and _then_ deal with your servants _according to what you see_." ^[Literally "and according to/that you see"]

###### v14
So he agreed to this proposal with them, and he tested them _for_ ten days.

###### v15
And at the end of ten days their appearances appeared better and _they were_ healthier of body than all the young men who were eating the fine food of the king.

###### v16
_So_ ^[Literally "And it happened"] the guard _continued to withhold_ ^[Literally "he was … withdrawing"] their fine food and the wine of their drink, and he gave them ^[Hebrew "to them"] vegetables.

###### v17
_And as for these four young men_, ^[Literally "And these young men, four of them"] God ^[Hebrew "the God"] gave to them knowledge and insight into all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had insight into all visions ^[Hebrew "vision"] and dreams.

###### v18
And at the end of the time the king had set to bring them, the commander of the court officials brought them in _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] Nebuchadnezzar.

###### v19
And the king spoke with them, _and among all of them no one was found like_ ^[Literally "and he was not found from all of them like"] Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; then they stood _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the king.

###### v20
And in every matter of wisdom _and_ understanding _about_ which the king inquired from them, he found them ten times better _than_ all _of_ the magicians ^[Or "soothsayer-priests"] _and_ conjurers ^[Or "enchanters"] that _were in his entire kingdom_. ^[Literally "in the whole of his kingdom"]
