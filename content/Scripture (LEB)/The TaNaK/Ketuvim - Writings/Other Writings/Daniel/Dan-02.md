###### v1
Now ^[Hebrew "And"] in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.

###### v2
So the king said to call the magicians ^[Or "soothsayer-priests"] and the conjurers ^[Or "enchanters"] and the sorcerers and the _astrologers_ ^[Literally "Chaldeans"] to tell to the king his dreams. And they came in and they stood _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the king.

###### v3
And the king said to them, "_I have had a dream_ ^[Literally "A dream I have dreamed"] and my spirit is anxious to know the dream."

###### v4
And the _astrologers_ ^[Literally "Chaldeans"] said to the king _in_ Aramaic, ^[The text of Daniel is in Aramaic from this point on through Daniel chapter 7. Then the text resumes in Hebrew to the end of the book] "O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants and we will reveal the explanation."

###### v5
The king answered and said to the _astrologers_, ^[Literally "Chaldeans"] "The command from me is firm: if you _do_ not make known to me the dream and its explanation, ^[Or "interpretation"] _then_ you will be broken into pieces and your houses will be laid in ruins.

###### v6
But if you tell me the dream and its explanation, you will receive gifts and rewards ^[Aramaic "reward"] and great honor from me. Therefore, tell me the dream and its explanation." ^[Or "interpretation"]

###### v7
They answered once more and said, "Let the king tell the dream to his servants and we will make the explanation known."

###### v8
The king answered and said, "_Certainly_ ^[Literally "From _a_ certainty"] I know that _you are trying to gain time_ ^[Literally "the time you are gaining"] _because_ ^[Literally "all because of that"] you have seen _that this matter is firmly decreed by me_, ^[Literally "that firm from me _is_ the decree"]

###### v9
for if you _do_ not make the dream known to me, _your verdict is fixed_, ^[Literally "one is your verdict"] and you have conspired to say _a_ lying and deceitful word to me until the _circumstances_ ^[Literally "time"] will change. Therefore, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can tell me its explanation."

###### v10
The _astrologers_ ^[Literally "Chaldeans"] answered the king and said, "There is not a man on earth that is able to reveal the word of the king; _in fact_, ^[Literally "all because that"] no great and powerful king has _ever_ asked a thing like this of any magician ^[Or "soothsayer-priest"] or conjurer ^[Or "enchanter"] or _astrologer_. ^[Literally "Chaldean"]

###### v11
And the thing that the king is asking _is too_ difficult and _there is no one who_ ^[Literally "there is not another"] can reveal it to the king except _the_ gods _whose dwelling is not with mortals_." ^[Literally "concerning their dwelling is not with flesh"]

###### v12
Because of this the king became angry, and he became very much enraged, and he said _that_ all the wise men of Babylon _are_ to be destroyed.

###### v13
And the decree was issued, and the wise men _were on the verge of being executed_, ^[Literally "were in the process of being killed"] and they searched for Daniel and his companions to be executed.

###### v14
Then Daniel responded prudently and discretely to Arioch, the commander of the imperial guard of the king, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon.

###### v15
_He asked_ ^[Literally "he answered"] and said to Arioch, the royal official of the king, "_Why_ ^[Literally "Over what"] is the decree from the king _so_ severe?" Then Arioch explained the matter ^[Or "situation"] to Daniel.

###### v16
And Daniel went in and requested from the king that he would give him time, and _he would tell the king_ ^[Literally "to tell/reveal to the king"] the explanation. ^[Or "interpretation"]

###### v17
Then Daniel went to his home, and he made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, his companions,

###### v18
and _told them_ to seek mercy _from the God of heaven_ ^[Literally "from before the God of the heaven"] concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions, along with the remainder of the wise men of Babylon, would not be killed.

###### v19
Then in a vision of the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel; then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

###### v20
Daniel _said_: ^[Literally "answered and he said"]
"Let his name, _the name_ of God, ^[Aramaic "the God"] be blessed _throughout the ages_, ^[Literally "from the age unto the age"]
for the wisdom and the power _are his_. ^[Literally "of to him it _is_"]

###### v21
And he changes the times and the seasons,
and he deposes kings and he sets up kings;
he gives wisdom ^[Aramaic "the wisdom"] to wise men
and knowledge to _men who_ know understanding.

###### v22
He reveals the deep and the hidden things;
he knows what _is_ in the darkness,
and the light dwells with him.

###### v23
To you, O God of my ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"]
I give thanks and I give praises,
for the wisdom and the power you gave to me,
and now you have made known to me
what we have asked from you,
for you have made known to us the matter of the king."

###### v24
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "Now because this"] Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed ^[Aramaic "has appointed"] to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and thus he said to him: "You must not destroy the wise men of Babylon; take me in before the king and I will give the explanation ^[Or "interpretation"] to the king."

###### v25
Then Arioch _quickly_ ^[Literally "in haste"] brought Daniel in before the king and thus he said to him: "I have found a man among _the exiles_ ^[Literally "the children of exiles"] of Judah ^[Aramaic "Jehud"] who _can relate_ ^[Literally "he will make known"] the explanation ^[Or "interpretation"] to the king.

###### v26
_The king then asked_ ^[Literally "The king answered"] and said to Daniel, whose name _was_ Belteshazzar, "Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its explanation?" ^[Or "interpretation"]

###### v27
Daniel answered the king and said, "The mystery that the king asks, no wise men, conjurers, ^[Or "enchanters"] magicians, ^[Or "soothsayer-priests"] _or_ diviners are able to make known to the king.

###### v28
But there is a God in heaven _who_ reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what _it is_ that will be at the end of days. This _is_ your dream and the visions of your head on your bed.

###### v29
"_As for you_, king, ^[Aramaic "the king"] your thoughts on your bed _turned to_ ^[Literally "they went up"] what _it was_ that would be _in the future_, ^[Literally "after this"] and the revealer of mysteries has made known to you what that would be.

###### v30
And as for me, _it is_ not because of wisdom that is in me more than _any other living person_ ^[Literally "all of living beings"] _that_ this mystery is revealed to me, but _in order that_ ^[Literally "concerning the matter of"] the explanation ^[Or "interpretation"] may be made known to the king and you will _understand_ ^[Literally "know"] the thoughts of your _mind_. ^[Literally "heart"]

###### v31
"You, O king, were looking and, look, there was one great statue. This statue _was_ huge and its brilliance extraordinary, standing _there_ before you, and its appearance _was_ frightening. ^[Or "dreadful"]

###### v32
The head of this statue _was_ of fine gold, its chest and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,

###### v33
its legs of iron, its feet, part of them of iron and part of them of clay.

###### v34
You were looking on _until_ ^[Literally "until that"] a stone was chiseled out ^[Or "became loose"]--that not by hands--and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and it broke them in pieces.

###### v35
Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold _all at once_ ^[Literally "like one"] broke into pieces ^[Or "were crushed"] and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floor, and the wind carried them away and any trace of them could not be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and it filled the whole earth.

###### v36
"This _was_ the dream, and _now_ we will tell its interpretation to the king.

###### v37
You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power and the might and the glory,

###### v38
and _also_ _human beings wherever they dwell_, ^[Literally "and into all that dwell sons of humankind"] the animals of the field and the birds ^[Aramaic "bird"] of heaven ^[Or "the sky"]--he has given into your hand and made you ruler over all of them--you are the head of gold.

###### v39
And after you another kingdom inferior to yours will arise, and another third _kingdom_ of bronze that will rule over the whole earth.

###### v40
And _a_ fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, _and_ _just as_ ^[Literally "all of because"] iron crushes and smashes _everything_, ^[Literally "the whole thing"] and as iron shatters all of these _other metals_, _so_ it will crush and it will shatter _these nations_.

###### v41
_And just as_ ^[Literally "And that"] you saw the feet and the toes, _partly potter's clay_ ^[Literally "from them clay of the potter"] and _partly iron_, ^[Literally "from them iron"] it will be a divided kingdom; and _some hardness_ ^[Literally "from the hardness"] of the iron will be _in it_, _just as_ ^[Literally "all of because that"] you have seen the iron mixed with the wet clay.

###### v42
And _as_ the toes of the feet _were_ partly iron and partly clay, _so_ part of the kingdom will be strong _and partly brittle_. ^[Literally "and from it, it will be brittle"]

###### v43
And _in_ that you saw the iron was mixed with wet clay, _so_ _they will mix in marriage_ ^[Literally "mixing they will in the seed of man"] and they will not cling _to one another_, ^[Literally "this one with that one"] just as iron _does_ not mix with clay.

###### v44
And _in the day of those kings_, ^[Literally "in their days of those kings"] the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will _never_ ^[Literally "to forever not"] be destroyed, and the kingdom will not be left for another nation, ^[Or "people"] and it will bring an end to all these kingdoms, but it will stand _forever_. ^[Literally "to eternity"]

###### v45
_Inasmuch as_ ^[Literally "All of because that"] you saw that a stone from the mountain was chiseled out ^[Or "became loose"] _but_ not by hands, and _that_ it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, _thereby_ the great God made known to the king what will be _in the future_, ^[Literally "after this"] and the dream is certain and its explanation trustworthy."

###### v46
Then the king, Nebuchadnezzar, fell on his face and he paid homage to Daniel; and he commanded _them_ to offer _a_ grain offering and incense offering to him.

###### v47
The king answered Daniel and said, "_Truly_ ^[Literally "From truth that"] your God _is_ the God of gods and the Lord of kings, and he reveals mysteries, for you are able to reveal this mystery."

###### v48
Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.

###### v49
And Daniel made a request from the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel _remained_ in the court of the king.
