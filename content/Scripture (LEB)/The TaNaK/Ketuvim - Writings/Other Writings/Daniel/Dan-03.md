###### v1
Nebuchadnezzar the king made a statue of gold. Its height _was_ sixty cubits _and_ its width _was_ six cubits; he set it up in the valley of Dura in the province of Babylon.

###### v2
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent _directions_ to assemble the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all of the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king _had_ set up.

###### v3
Then the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the province _were_ assembled for the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king _had_ set up, and _were_ standing _before_ ^[Literally "to _the_ front"] the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

###### v4
Then the herald proclaimed _aloud_, ^[Literally "with power"] "To you _it is commanded_, ^[Literally "they _are_ saying"] O peoples, _nations and people of all languages_, ^[Literally "the nations and the languages"]

###### v5
_that_ at the time that you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, _the_ lyre, _the_ trigon, _the_ harp, _the_ drum and all kinds of music, you must fall down and you must worship the statue of gold ^[Aramaic "the gold"] that Nebuchadnezzar the king _has_ set up.

###### v6
And _whoever_ ^[Literally "who that"] does not fall down and worship will be thrown _immediately_ ^[Literally "the time"] into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire."

###### v7
_Therefore_, ^[Literally "All of because this"] _at that time_, ^[Literally "at the time"] _as soon as_ ^[Literally "as that"] all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, the flute, _the_ lyre, _the_ trigon, _the_ harp and all kinds of music, all the peoples, _the nations and people of all languages_ ^[Literally "the nations and the languages"] _were_ falling down _and_ were worshiping the statue of gold ^[Aramaic "the gold"] that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

###### v8
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "All because of this"] _at this time_ ^[Literally "at it the time"] _some_ _astrologers_ ^[Literally "Chaldean men"] came forward and _they denounced the Jews_. ^[Literally "they ate their pieces of the Jews"]

###### v9
_They responded and said_ ^[Literally "they answered and _were_ saying"] to Nebuchadnezzar the king, "O king, may _you_ live _forever_! ^[Literally "to eternity"]

###### v10
You, O king, have made a decree that _everyone_ ^[Literally "all of humanity"] who hears the sound of the horn, the flute, _the_ lyre, _the_ trigon, _the_ harp and _the_ drum and all kinds of music, he shall fall down and shall worship the statue of gold. ^[Aramaic "the gold"]

###### v11
_And whoever_ ^[Literally "And who that"] _does not fall down_ ^[Literally "not he falls down"] and worship shall be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.

###### v12
_However_ there are Judean men whom you have appointed ^[Aramaic "whom you have appointed them"] over the affairs of the province of Babylon--Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego--these men, O king, _pay you no heed_ ^[Literally "not they pay heed to you"] _and_ _were_ not serving your god, and the statue of gold ^[Aramaic "the gold"] that you set up they are not worshiping."

###### v13
Then Nebuchadnezzar said in rage and anger to bring in Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego; then they brought in these men before the king.

###### v14
Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, "_Is it_ true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, _that_ you are not serving my god, and _you are_ not worshiping the statue of gold ^[Aramaic "the gold"] that I have set up?

###### v15
Now if you are ready so that _when_ ^[Literally "at that time"] you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, _the_ trigon, _the_ harp and _the_ drum and all kinds of music, you fall down and you worship the statue that I have made, _that will be good_. But if you do not worship it, _immediately_ ^[Literally "at that _very_ time"] you will be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire, and _who is the god_ ^[Literally "who he god"] who ^[Or "that"] will rescue you from my hands?"

###### v16
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king, Nebuchadnezzar, "We have no need on this matter _to present a defense to you_. ^[Literally "to return to you"]

###### v17
_If it is so_, ^[Literally "If there is"] our God, whom we serve, is able to rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire. And from your hand, O king, let him rescue us.

###### v18
And if not, let it be known to you, O king, that _we will not serve your gods_, ^[Literally "your gods not there is us serving"] and the statue of gold ^[Aramaic "the gold"] that you have set up we will not worship."

###### v19
Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with anger and the image of his face was changed _toward_ ^[Literally "against"] Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, _so he_ _ordered and said_ ^[Literally "answering and saying"] to heat up the one furnace seven times what was usual to heat _it_ up.

###### v20
And he commanded _the strongest men of the guards_ ^[Literally "to the strong men, men of strength"] who _were_ in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and to throw _them_ into the furnace of blazing fire.

###### v21
Then these men were bound with their garments, their trousers and their turbans and their _other_ clothing, and they were thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.

###### v22
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "because of this"] _because_ ^[Literally "from that"] the word of the king was severe and the furnace was exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed these men who lifted up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.

###### v23
But these men, the three of them, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, fell down into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire, _and they_ were bound.

###### v24
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and he rose up in haste _and_ he asked, saying to his advisers, "_Did_ we not throw three men, bound, into the midst of the fire? They answered, saying to the king, "Certainly, O king!"

###### v25
_He answered_, ^[Literally "_was_ answering"] saying, "Look, I see four men unbound walking in the midst of the fire and there is no damage to them, and the ^[Aramaic "its"] appearance of the fourth _man_ resembles the son of a god."

###### v26
Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire, _and_ he called out, saying, "Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, _servants_ ^[Literally "his servant"] of the Most High God, come out ^[Or "Go out"] and come here!"

###### v27
And the satraps, the prefects, the governors and the advisors of the king _were_ assembling, _and_ they saw these men, that the fire had no power over their bodies, and the hair of their heads was ^[Aramaic plural] not singed, and their garments were not harmed, and the smell of fire did not come from them.

###### v28
Nebuchadnezzar _responded_, ^[Literally "answering"] saying, "Blessed be their God, _the God_ of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who sent his angel ^[Or "messenger"] and rescued his servants who trusted in him, and the command of the king they disobeyed, and they gave their bodies so that they _did_ not serve and _did_ not worship any god except their God.

###### v29
And from me _is set forth_ ^[Literally "setting out"] a decree that any people, nation, or language that _may_ utter criticism against their God--_the God of_ Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego--will be broken into pieces and their ^[Aramaic "his"] house will be made like ruins. _For_ ^[Literally "All of because"] there is not another God who is able to rescue like this _God_."

###### v30
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
