###### v1
 ^[[[Dan-04|Daniel 4:1–4:37]] in the English Bible is 3:31–4:34 in the Hebrew Bible] Nebuchadnezzar the king to all of the nations, the peoples and languages that live in the whole earth: "May your prosperity increase!

###### v2
It is pleasing to me to recount the signs and wonders that the Most High God worked for me.

###### v3
How great _are_ his signs and wonders, how strong _is_ his kingdom, _an everlasting kingdom_; ^[Literally "a kingdom of eternity"] and his sovereignty is from generation to generation.

###### v4
"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was content in my house and prospering in my palace.

###### v5
And I saw a dream and a revelation on my bed and it frightened me, and the visions of my head terrified me.

###### v6
And a decree was _sent out_, ^[Literally "put/placed"] _ordering that_ all _the_ wise men of Babylon _were_ to be brought in before me _so_ that they may make known to me _the_ explanation of the dream.

###### v7
Then the magicians, ^[Or "soothsayer-priests"] the conjurers, ^[Or "enchanters"] the _astrologers_ ^[Literally "Chaldeans"] and the diviners came in and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its explanation. ^[Or "interpretation"]

###### v8
Then _at last_ ^[Literally "until another"] Daniel came before me _whose name was_ ^[Literally "who name his"] Belteshazzar, _according to_ ^[Literally "like"] the name of my god, _and_ _in whom was the spirit of the holy gods_, ^[Literally "and who _the_ spirit of gods holy in him"] _and I related the dream to him_. ^[Literally "and the dream before him I told"]

###### v9
"'_O_ Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, ^[Or "soothsayer-priests"] I myself know that _the_ spirit ^[Or "a spirit"] of _the_ holy gods _is_ in you, and _no mystery is too difficult_ ^[Literally "every mystery is not difficult"] for you. _Now_ tell _me_ _the_ visions of my dream that I saw, and its explanation. ^[Or "interpretation"]

###### v10
Now _these were_ the visions of my head _as I was lying_ on my bed: I was _gazing_ ^[Literally "seeing"] and, look, a tree _was_ in the midst of the earth, and its height _was_ exalted.

###### v11
The tree grew and it became strong,
and its height reached to heaven, ^[Or "the sky"]
and _it was visible to the end of the whole earth_. ^[Literally "and its appearance _was_ to _the_ end of the whole earth"]

###### v12
Its foliage _was_ beautiful,
and its fruit abundant,
and in it _was_ provision for all.
Under it the animals ^[Aramaic "animal"] of the field sought shade,
and in its branches the birds of heaven ^[Or "the sky"] nested,
and from it all the living beings were fed.

###### v13
"'I was looking in the vision of my head _as I lay_ on my bed, and look, a watcher, ^[Or "angelic being"] and _a_ holy _one_, came down from heaven.

###### v14
He cried _aloud_ ^[Literally "in strength"] and so he said:
"Cut down the tree and chop off its branches;
shake off its foliage and scatter its fruit.
Let the animals flee from under it,
and the birds from its branches.

###### v15
But the stump of its roots
leave in the earth,
_along with_ ^[Literally "and with"] a band of iron and bronze;
_leave it_ in the grass of the field.
And in ^[Or "with"] the dew of heaven
let it ^[Or "him," that is, the king] be watered,
and with the animals ^[Aramaic "animal"]
let his lot _be_ in _the_ grass of the earth.

###### v16
Let his mind be changed from _that of a_ human, ^[Or "the human"]
and let _the_ mind of an animal be given to him,
and let seven times pass over him.

###### v17
The sentence _is_ by _the_ decree of _the_ watchers,
and the decision _by_ _the_ command of _the_ holy _ones_,
_in order that_ ^[Literally "until matter that"] the living will know
that the Most High _is_ sovereign over _the_ kingdom of humankind,
and _to whomever_ ^[Literally "to whom that"] he wills he gives it,
and he _even_ sets _the_ humblest of men over it."

###### v18
"'This _is_ the dream _that_ I, Nebuchadnezzar the king, saw. Now ^[Or "And"] you, Belteshazzar, declare its explanation, _for_ ^[Literally "all of because that"] all of _the_ wise men of my kingdom were not able to make the explanation known to me, but you are able because _the_ spirit of holy gods _is_ in you.'

###### v19
"Then Daniel, whose name _was_ Belteshazzar, was distressed _for some time_, ^[Literally "for one hour"] and his thoughts disturbed him. The king answered and he said, 'Belteshazzar, let the dream and its explanation not disturb you.' Belteshazzar answered and said, 'My lord, _may_ the dream and its explanation _be_ for _those who_ hate you and for your enemies.

###### v20
The tree that you saw, which grew and became strong and its height reached to heaven ^[Or "the sky"] and _it was visible to the end of the whole earth_, ^[Literally "its appearance to the all the earth"]

###### v21
and its foliage _was_ beautiful and its fruit abundant, and _so there was_ provision for all in it, _and_ the animals ^[Aramaic "animal"] of the field lived under it and in its branches nest _the_ birds of heaven, ^[Or "the sky"]

###### v22
--it is you, O king, who have grown _great_ and you have grown strong, and _so_ your greatness has increased and it has reached to heaven ^[Or "the sky"] and your sovereignty to the end of the earth.

###### v23
And _inasmuch_ that the king saw _the_ watcher, a holy _one_ coming down from heaven ^[Or "the sky"] and he said, "Cut down the tree and destroy it, but the stump of its root in the earth leave with a band of iron and bronze in the grass of the field, and let it be watered with the dew of heaven and _let_ his lot _be_ with _the_ animals of the field _until seven times have passed over him_." ^[Literally "until that seven times _they_ pass over him"]

###### v24
This _is_ the explanation, O king, and it _is_ a decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord the king:

###### v25
you will be driven away _from human society_ ^[Literally "from the humankind"] and _you will dwell_ ^[Literally "your dwelling will be"] with the animals ^[Aramaic "animal"] of the field, and you will be caused to graze grass like the oxen _yourself_, ^[Literally "with respect to you"] and you will be watered with the dew of heaven, and seven _periods of_ time will pass over you until that you have acknowledged that the Most High _is_ sovereign over the kingdom of humankind, and _to whom he wills_ ^[Literally "that he wills"] he gives it.

###### v26
_And in that_ ^[Literally "And for"] they said to leave alone the stump of the tree's root, so your kingdom _will be_ restored for you _when_ ^[Literally "from that"] you acknowledge that heaven _is_ sovereign.

###### v27
Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable _to you_ and your sin remove ^[Or "replace"] with righteousness and your iniquity with having mercy on _the_ oppressed, _in case there might be a prolongation of your prosperity_.'" ^[Literally "if will be prolongation for your prosperity"]

###### v28
_All this happened_ ^[Literally "It came upon"] to Nebuchadnezzar the king.

###### v29
At the end of twelve months he was walking on the _roof of_ _the royal palace_ ^[Literally "the place of the kingdom"] of Babylon.

###### v30
And the king answered and said, "Is this not the great Babylon which I have built as a royal palace by the strength of my own power, and for the glory of my own majesty?"

###### v31
_While_ the words _were_ still in the mouth of the king, a voice from heaven came, _saying_, 'To you, King Nebuchadnezzar, _it_ is declared that the kingdom has departed from you,

###### v32
and you will be driven away from _human society_ ^[Literally "the humankind"] and your dwelling _will be_ with the animals ^[Aramaic "animal"] of the field and they will cause you to graze _the_ grass like oxen, and seven times will pass over you, until you acknowledge that the Most High _is_ sovereign over the kingdom of humankind and that he gives it to whom he wills.'

###### v33
_Immediately_ ^[Literally "In that hour"] the word was fulfilled _concerning_ ^[Literally "over"] Nebuchadnezzar, and he was expelled from _human society_ ^[Literally "the humankind"] and he ate grass like oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven until his hair _was_ like _the hair of_ an eagle and his nails grew like _a_ bird's _claws_.

###### v34
"But at the end of _that period_, ^[Literally "the day"] I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and _then_ my reason returned to me; and I blessed the Most High and _the one who lives forever_ ^[Literally "_the one_ living forever"] I praised and I honored.
"For his sovereignty _is_ _an_ everlasting sovereignty,
and his kingdom _continues_ from generation to generation.

###### v35
And all the dwellers of the earth
are regarded as nothing,
and he does _according to_ ^[Literally "as"] his desire
in the host of heaven and _among_ the dwellers of earth,
and there is not _one_ who can hold back his hand,
or _ask him_, ^[Literally "or asks to him"] 'What are you doing?'

###### v36
"_At that time_ ^[Literally "In it the time"] my reason returned to me, and _also_ the glory of my kingdom and my majesty and splendor returned to me, and my advisers and my lords ^[Or "nobles"] searched _me_ out, and I was established over my kingdom and abundant greatness was added to me.

###### v37
Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the king of heaven, for all his works _are_ truth, ^[Or "true"] and his ways _are_ justice and that he is able to humble those who walk in pride."
