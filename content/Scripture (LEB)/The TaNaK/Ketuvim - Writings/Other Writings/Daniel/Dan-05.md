###### v1
Belshazzar the king made a great festival for _a_ thousand _of_ his lords, ^[Or "nobles"] and _in the presence of_ ^[Literally "to over against"] the thousand _lords_ he was drinking wine. ^[Or "the wine"]

###### v2
_When he tasted the wine_, ^[Literally "At the taste of the wine"] Belshazzar commanded _that they_ bring _the_ vessels of gold and silver that Nebuchadnezzar his _predecessor_ ^[Literally "father"] had taken from the temple that _was_ in Jerusalem, so that the king and his lords, ^[Or "nobles"] his wives and his concubines may drink from them.

###### v3
Then they brought in the vessels of gold that they took from the temple, the house of God that _was_ in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, ^[Or "nobles"] his wives and his concubines drank from them.

###### v4
They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood and stone. ^[All these metals have the definite article that does not have to be translated into English to retain the meaning]

###### v5
_Immediately_ ^[Literally "In its the hour"] _human fingers_ ^[Literally "fingers of _the_ hand of a man"] appeared and they wrote _opposite_ ^[Literally "to over against"] the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the palace of the king, and the king was watching ^[Or "gazing at"] the palm of the hand that was writing.

###### v6
Then his face changed and his thoughts terrified him, and _his hip joints gave way_ ^[Literally "the limbs of his hip became loose"] and _his knees knocked together_. ^[Literally "his knees this to this they knocked together"]

###### v7
The king cried _aloud_ ^[Literally "with strength"] to bring _in_ the conjurers, ^[Or "enchanters"] the _astrologers_ ^[Literally "Chaldeans"] and the diviners; the king _spoke_ ^[Literally "answered"] and said to _the_ wise men of Babylon, "Any man that can read this writing and can tell me its explanation will be clothed _in_ purple and _will have_ _a_ necklace of gold _hung_ around his neck and he will rule _as_ third _in authority_ in the kingdom."

###### v8
Then all the wise men of the king came in, but they were not able to read the writing or to make known its explanation. ^[Aramaic "the explanation/ interpretation"]

###### v9
Then the king, Belshazzar, became greatly terrified, and _his facial features_ ^[Literally "shining of his face"] changed upon him, and his lords ^[Or "nobles"] were perplexed.

###### v10
Because of the words of the king and his lords, ^[Or "nobles"] the queen came into _the banqueting hall_ ^[Literally "the house of the drinking"] and the queen _spoke up_ ^[Literally "answered"] and said, "O king, live _forever_, ^[Literally "to eternity"] and let not your thoughts terrify you and _do_ not let your facial expressions _grow pale_. ^[Literally "change"]

###### v11
There is a man in your kingdom _who has the spirit of the holy gods in him_. ^[Literally "who _the_ spirit of holy gods _is_ in him"] And in the days of your _predecessor_, ^[Literally "father"] enlightenment and insight and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him; and, O king, Nebuchadnezzar your _predecessor_ ^[Literally "father"] appointed him _as_ chief of the magicians, ^[Or "soothsayer-priests"] the conjurers, ^[Or "enchanters"] the _astrologers_, ^[Literally "Chaldeans"] _and_ the diviners. Your _predecessor_ ^[Literally "father"] the king _did this_

###### v12
_because_ ^[Literally "all of because that"] _there_ was found in him _an_ excellent spirit and understanding and insight _for_ interpreting dreams and explaining riddles and solving riddles; _that is_, in Daniel _whom the king named_ ^[Literally "whom the king gave his name"] Belteshazzar. Now, let Daniel be called and he will tell the explanation." ^[Or "interpretation"]

###### v13
Then Daniel was brought in before the king, _and_ the king _spoke_ ^[Literally "answered"] and said to Daniel, "You _are_ Daniel _who are one of the exiles_ ^[Literally "who from sons of the exile"] of Judah ^[Aramaic "Jehud"] whom my _predecessor_, ^[Literally "father"] the king, brought from Judah. ^[Aramaic "Jehud"]

###### v14
And I have heard that a spirit of the gods _is_ in you and enlightenment and insight and excellent wisdom was found in you.

###### v15
And now the wise men _and_ the conjurers ^[Or "enchanters"] were brought in before me _so_ that they could read this writing _in order to_ make its explanation ^[Or "interpretation"] known to me, but they were not able to disclose the explanation ^[Or "interpretation"] of the matter.

###### v16
But I have heard concerning you that you are able _to produce interpretations_ ^[Literally "to interpret interpretations"] and to solve riddles; now if you are able to read the writing and to make known its explanation ^[Or "interpretation"] to me, you will be clothed _in_ purple and _a_ necklace of gold _will be placed_ around your neck and you will rule _as_ third _in command_ in the kingdom."

###### v17
Then Daniel answered and said before the king, "Let your gifts be for yourself or your rewards give to another; nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and I will make known to him the explanation. ^[Or "interpretation"]

###### v18
_O king_, ^[Literally "You, O king"] the Most High God gave the kingdom and the greatness and the glory and the majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your _predecessor_. ^[Literally "father"]

###### v19
And because of the greatness that he gave to him, all the peoples, the nations and languages trembled and feared before him; whomever he wanted he killed, and whomever he wanted he let live, and whomever he wanted he honored, and whomever he wanted he humbled.

###### v20
But _when_ ^[Literally "as that"] his heart became arrogant and his spirit became hard _so as_ to act proudly, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom and the ^[Or "his"] glory _was taken away from him_. ^[Literally "they took away"]

###### v21
And he was driven away _from human society_ ^[Literally "from the sons of the humankind"] and his mind was made like the animals ^[Aramaic "with the animals"] and his dwelling _was_ with the wild asses; _and_ _he was given_ ^[Literally "they gave him"] grass like oxen to eat, and with ^[Aramaic "from"] the dew of heaven his body was bathed, until he acknowledged that the Most High God _is_ sovereign over the kingdom of humankind, and _whoever_ ^[Literally "to from that"] he wants he sets over it.

###### v22
"But you his _successor_, ^[Literally "son"] Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart _even though_ ^[Literally "all of because that"] you knew all this.

###### v23
And _now_ you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven, and the vessels of his temple you have brought in before you, and you and your lords, ^[Or "nobles"] your wives and your concubines, have been drinking wine from ^[Aramaic "with"] them, and you have praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone ^[All the materials in this list have the definite article that does not have to be translated into English] that _do_ not see and _do_ not hear and _do_ not know, but the God _who holds your life in his hand_ ^[Literally "who your breath _is_ in his hand"] and all of your ways _come from him_, ^[Literally "_belong_ to him"] you have not honored.

###### v24
So then the palm of the hand was sent out from his presence and this writing was inscribed.

###### v25
"Now this was the writing that was inscribed: 'Mene, Mene, Tekel and Parsin.'

###### v26
"This _is_ the explanation of the matter: ^[Or "word, message"] 'Mene'--God has numbered your kingdom and brought an end _to_ it.

###### v27
"'Tekel'--you have been weighed on scales and you have been found wanting. ^[Or "deficient"]

###### v28
"'Peres'--your kingdom has been divided and given to _the_ Medes and Persians.'"

###### v29
Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel _with_ purple and _placed_ a necklace of gold around his neck, and they made a proclamation concerning him that he would be _the_ third ruler _in authority_ in the kingdom.

###### v30
_That same night_ ^[Literally "In it, in the night"] Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was killed.

###### v31
 ^[[[Dan-05#v31|Daniel 5:31–6:28]] in the English Bible is 6:1–29 in the Hebrew Bible] And Darius the Mede received the kingdom _when he was about sixty-two years old_. ^[Literally "when a son of sixty and two years"]
