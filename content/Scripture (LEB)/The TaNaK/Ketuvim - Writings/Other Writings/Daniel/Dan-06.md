###### v1
_It pleased Darius_, ^[Literally "It was pleasant before Darius"] and he set up one hundred and twenty satraps over the kingdom, that they were _throughout the whole kingdom_, ^[Literally "in all the kingdom"]

###### v2
and over them _were_ three administrators, _of_ whom Daniel _was_ one, _so_ that these satraps were giving account to them, and the king would not be suffering loss.

###### v3
Then Daniel _began distinguishing himself_ ^[Literally "was distinguishing himself"] above the administrators and the satraps _because_ ^[Literally "all of because that"] an exceptional spirit _was_ in him, and _so_ the king planned to appoint him over the whole kingdom.

###### v4
Then the _other_ administrators and satraps _began to seek_ ^[Literally "were seeking"] to find _a_ pretext against Daniel _in connection with the kingdom_, ^[Literally "from the side of the kingdom"] but they were not able to find any pretext and _corruption_ ^[Literally "being corrupt"] _because_ ^[Literally "all because that"] he was trustworthy, and no ^[Aramaic "any"] negligence or _corruption_ ^[Literally "being corrupt"] _could be found in him_. ^[Literally "not could be found"]

###### v5
Then these men _said_, ^[Literally "_were_ saying"] "We will not find any pretext ^[Or "basis for accusation"] against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God."

###### v6
So the administrators and the satraps conspired _with respect to_ ^[Literally "on/upon"] the king and so they said to him, "Darius, O king, live _forever_! ^[Literally "to eternity"]

###### v7
All of _the_ administrators of the kingdom, and the prefects, the satraps, the counselors and the governors took counsel _and have_ agreed to establish an edict of the king and to enforce a decree that _whoever_ ^[Literally "all that"] will seek a prayer from any god or human except from you _for_ up to thirty days will be thrown into _the lion pit_. ^[Literally "pit of lions"]

###### v8
Now, O king, establish the edict and you must sign the document _so_ that _it_ cannot be changed, according to _the_ law of _the_ Medes and Persians which cannot be revoked."

###### v9
_So_ ^[Literally "Like to before this"] the king, Darius, signed the writing and the interdict. ^[Or "the writing that is the interdict"]

###### v10
Now _when_ ^[Literally "as that"] Daniel realized that the document was signed, he went to his house (_now he had windows in his upper room that were open_ ^[Literally "and windows were open to him in his upper room"] toward Jerusalem), and three times _daily_ ^[Literally "in the day"] he knelt on his knees and prayed and _gave_ praise before his God, _just as_ ^[Literally "all because that"] he had been doing _previously_. ^[Literally "from before this"]

###### v11
Then these men came as a group and they found Daniel praying and pleading for mercy before his God.

###### v12
Then they approached _and spoke with the king_ ^[Literally "and saying before the king"] concerning the edict of the king, "_Did you not sign an edict_ ^[Literally "Not an edict you signed?"] that any person who would seek _anything_ from any God or human within thirty days except from you, O king, would be thrown into _the lion pit_?" ^[Literally "pit of lions"] The king answered and said, "The matter _as you have just stated_ is certain according to _the_ law of _the_ Medes and Persians which cannot be revoked."

###### v13
Then _they responded_ ^[Literally "they answered"] and said before the king, "Daniel, who _is_ from _the exiles_ ^[Literally "the sons of the exile"] of Judah, ^[Aramaic "Jehud"] _is not paying any attention_ ^[Literally "not he sets _his mind_"] to you, O king, or to the decree that you have signed, _and three times daily_ ^[Literally "and three times on the day"] he says his prayer."

###### v14
Then the king, when ^[Aramaic "as "] he heard that _report_, ^[Literally "word"] he was extremely distressed over it; and _concerning Daniel_ ^[Literally "upon Daniel"] _he was determined_ ^[Literally "he set _his_ heart"] to rescue him. And until the setting of the sun he was making every effort to deliver him.

###### v15
Then these men came as _a_ group to the king and _said_, ^[Literally "saying"] "Recall, O king, that _with respect to_ _the_ law of ^[Aramaic "to"] _the_ Medes and Persians that _any_ ^[Literally "all/every"] decree or edict that the king establishes cannot be changed."

###### v16
Then the king gave the command, and Daniel was brought in and they threw _him_ into _the lion pit_. ^[Literally "pit of lions"] _The king said_ ^[Literally "The king answered and saying"] to Daniel, "Your God, whom you serve _faithfully_, ^[Literally "in the loyalty"] may he rescue you!"

###### v17
And a ^[Aramaic "one"] stone was brought and it was put on the entrance of the pit, and the king sealed it with his signet _ring_ and with the signet _rings_ of his lords, ^[Or "nobles"] so that nothing would be changed concerning Daniel.

###### v18
Then the king went to his palace and spent the night in fasting, and no food was brought in before him and his sleep fled from him.

###### v19
Then the king got up at daybreak, at first light, and he went _in haste_ ^[Literally "to hasten"] to _the lion pit_. ^[Literally "pit of lions"]

###### v20
And _when he came near_ ^[Literally "as coming near him"] to the pit, he cried out to Daniel with _a_ distressed voice, _and_ the king _spoke_ ^[Literally "answered"] and said to Daniel, "O Daniel, servant of the living God, your God whom you serve faithfully, was he able to rescue you from the lions?"

###### v21
Then Daniel spoke to ^[Aramaic "with"] the king, "O king, live _forever_! ^[Literally "unto endless ages"]

###### v22
My God sent his angel and he shut the mouth of the lions and they did not ^[Aramaic "would not"] hurt me, _because_ ^[Literally "all of because that"] before him _I was found_ ^[Literally "it was found for me"] blameless, and also before you, O king, I have not done _any_ wrong."

###### v23
Then the king was exceedingly glad over it ^[That is, the situation] and commanded _that_ Daniel be lifted up from the pit; and _there_ was not any wound found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

###### v24
The king then commanded, and these men were brought _who had accused Daniel_, ^[Literally "they ate his pieces of Daniel"] and they threw them and their children and their wives into _the lion pit_, ^[Literally "pit of lions"] and they had not reached the floor of the pit _before_ ^[Literally "until that"] the lions had overpowered them and they had crushed all of their bones.

###### v25
Then Darius the king wrote to all the people, the nations, and the languages living in the whole earth, "May your prosperity become great!

###### v26
_I make a decree_ ^[Literally "From before me is put forth a decree"] that in all the dominion of my kingdom _people_ will be trembling and fearing before the God of Daniel, for he _is_ the living God and endures _forever_ ^[Literally "to eternity/endless ages"] and his ^[Literally "and whose"] kingdom _is_ one that will not be destroyed and his _dominion has no end_. ^[Literally "dominion his to the end"]

###### v27
_He is_ rescuing, delivering, and working signs and wonders in the heavens and on earth, for he _has_ rescued Daniel from the _power_ ^[Literally "hand"] of the lions."

###### v28
So this Daniel prospered during the kingdom of Darius and during the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.
