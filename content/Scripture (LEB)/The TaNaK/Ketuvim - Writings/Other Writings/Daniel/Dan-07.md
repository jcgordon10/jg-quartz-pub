###### v1
In the first year of Belshazzar the king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions ^[Or "the visions"] of his head _as he lay_ on his bed; then he wrote down the dream _and_ _the_ _summary_ ^[Literally "head"] of _the_ words _as follows_: ^[Literally "saying"]

###### v2
Daniel _explained_ ^[Literally "answered"] and said, "I was looking in my vision in the night, and look, the four winds of heaven were stirring _up_ the great sea.

###### v3
And four great beasts _were_ coming up from the sea, differing _from one another_. ^[Literally "this from this"]

###### v4
The first _was_ like _a_ lion and _had_ ^[Literally "for him/it"] _the_ wings of an eagle. I was watching until its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth and it was raised on _its_ feet like a human, and a human heart was given to it.

###### v5
And look, another beast, a second one, looking like a bear. And it was raised up on one side and three tusks ^[Or "ribs"] _were_ in its mouth between its teeth, and so _it was told_, ^[Literally "they were saying"] "Arise, eat much flesh!"

###### v6
After this I was watching and look, another _beast_ like a leopard; _it had four wings_ ^[Literally "and _there were_ to it four wings"] of a bird on its back, and _the beast had_ ^[Literally "to the beast"] four heads, and dominion was given to it.

###### v7
After this in the visions of the night I was looking and there was a fourth beast, terrifying and frightful and exceedingly strong, and _it had_ ^[Literally "_were_ to it"] _great iron teeth_, ^[Literally "teeth of iron for it great"] _and it was_ devouring and crushing, and it stamped the remainder ^[Or "residue"] with its feet; and it was different from all _the other_ beasts _that preceded it_ ^[Literally "that preceding her/it"] _and it had ten horns_. ^[Literally "and ten horns for her/it"]

###### v8
I was considering the horns, and look, another little horn came up _among_ ^[Literally "between"] them, and three of the earlier horns _were rooted out_ ^[Literally "dehorned"] from before it, and there were eyes like the eyes of _a_ human ^[Or "humankind"] in this horn and _also_ a mouth _that was_ speaking boastfully.

###### v9
"_I continued watching_ ^[Literally "I was watching"] until thrones were placed and an Ancient of Days sat; his clothing _was_ like white snow and the hair of his head _was_ like pure wool and his throne _was_ a flame ^[Or "ablaze with"] of fire and its wheels ^[Aramaic "wheel"] _were_ burning fire.

###### v10
A stream of fire issued forth and flowed _from his presence_; ^[Literally "from before him"] thousands _upon_ thousands served him and ten thousand _upon_ ten thousand stood before him. The judge sat, and _the_ books were opened.

###### v11
"_I continued watching_ ^[Literally "I was watching"] then ^[Aramaic "in then"] because of the noise of the boastful words of the horn _who was_ speaking; _I continued watching_ ^[Literally "I was watching"] until the beast was slain and its body was destroyed, and it was given _over_ to burning with fire.

###### v12
And _as for_ the remainder of the beasts, _their dominion was taken away_, ^[Literally "they took away their dominion"] but a prolongation _of their life_ ^[Literally "in life"] was given to them for a season and a time.

###### v13
"_I continued watching_ ^[Literally "I was watching"] in the visions of the night, and look, with the clouds of heaven _one_ like a son of man ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] was coming, and he came to the Ancient of Days, and _was presented_ ^[Literally "they presented him"] before him.

###### v14
And to him was given dominion and glory and kingship that ^[Aramaic "and"] all the peoples, the nations, and languages _would_ serve him; his dominion _is_ a dominion _without end_ ^[Literally "of eternity"] that will not cease, and his kingdom _is one_ that will not be destroyed.

###### v15
"_As for me, Daniel_, ^[Literally "I Daniel"] my spirit was troubled _within me_, ^[Literally "in the midst of sheath"] and the visions of my head terrified me.

###### v16
_So_ I approached one of the attendants and I asked him ^[Aramaic "from him"] _about_ the truth concerning all this; and he told me ^[Aramaic "to me"] _that_ he would make known to me the explanation of the matter.

###### v17
'These great beasts which are four _in number_ _are_ four kings _who_ will arise from the earth.

###### v18
But the holy ones ^[Or "saints"] of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and they will take possession of the kingdom forever, _forever and ever_.' ^[Literally "forever and to forever"]

###### v19
"Then I desired to make certain concerning the fourth beast that was different from _all the others_ ^[Literally "all _of_ them"]--exceedingly terrifying, with its iron teeth and its claws of bronze; it devoured and crushed _and_ stamped the remainder with its feet--

###### v20
and concerning the horns that _were_ on its head, and _concerning_ _the_ other _horn_ that came up and _before which three horns fell_, ^[Literally "and fell from before it three"] and this horn _had eyes_ ^[Literally "and eyes to it"] and _a_ mouth speaking _boastfully_, ^[Literally "abundantly"] and its appearance _was_ larger than its companions.

###### v21
_I continued watching_, ^[Literally "I was watching"] and this horn made war with _the_ holy ones ^[Or "saints"] and it prevailed over them,

###### v22
until the Ancient of Days came and gave judgment to _the_ holy ones ^[Or "saints"] of _the_ Most High; and the time arrived and _the_ holy ones ^[Or "saints"] took possession of the kingdom.

###### v23
"And he said, 'The fourth beast _is_ the fourth kingdom _that_ will be on the earth that will be different from all the _other_ kingdoms, and it will devour the whole earth and it will trample it and it will crush it.

###### v24
And _as for_ the ten horns _coming_ from it, _from_ this kingdom ^[Or "the kingdom"] ten kings will arise, and another will arise after them. And he will be different from the earlier _ones_, and he will subdue three kings.

###### v25
And he will speak words against the Most High, and he will wear out _the_ holy ones ^[Or "saints"] of the Most High, and he will attempt to change times and law, and they will be given into his hand for a time and two times and half a time.

###### v26
Then the court will sit, and his dominion will be removed, ^[Or "taken away"] to be eradicated and to be destroyed _totally_. ^[Literally "until the end"]

###### v27
And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to _the_ nation of _the_ holy ones ^[Or "saints"] of the Most High; his kingdom _is an everlasting kingdom_, ^[Literally "_is_ a kingdom of eternity"] and all the dominions will serve and obey him.'

###### v28
_This is the end of the account_. ^[Literally "Up to here _is_ the end of the account"] _As for me, Daniel_ ^[Literally "I Daniel"]--my thoughts terrified me greatly and my face changed over me, but I kept the matter in my heart." ^[Or "to myself"]
