###### v1
In the third year _of_ the kingdom of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared _to me, Daniel_, ^[Literally "I Daniel"] after the one that appeared to me _previously_. ^[Literally "in the beginning"]

###### v2
And I saw in the vision, _and when I saw_, ^[Literally "and it was at my seeing"] I _was_ in Susa, the citadel that _was_ in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and _I myself_ ^[Literally "I, I was"] was at the stream of Ulai. ^[Or "Ulai Canal" (NASB); "stream of the Ulai" (NEB)]

###### v3
And I lifted up my eyes and I saw, and look! A ram ^[Hebrew "One ram"] standing _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the stream, and _it had_ ^[Literally "for it"] two horns, and the horns _were_ long, but the one _was_ longer than the second, and the longer _one_ came up _after the other one_. ^[Literally "in the behind of the other"]

###### v4
I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward, and _none of the beasts stood before it_, ^[Literally "all _the_ beasts not they withstood to the face of him"] and there was no rescuing from _its power_, ^[Literally "its hand"] and it did _what it wanted_ ^[Literally "according to its will"] and it became strong. ^[Or "it/he magnified itself/himself"]

###### v5
And I was considering _this_, and look, a he-goat coming from the west across the face of the whole earth, and _it_ was not touching the ground; ^[Or "earth," or "land"] and the he-goat _had_ _a conspicuous horn_ ^[Literally "a horn of vision"] between its eyes.

###### v6
Then it came toward the ram _that had the two horns_ ^[Literally "the owner of the two horns"] that I saw standing _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the stream, and it ran at it with ^[Or "in"] the rage of its power.

###### v7
And I saw it approaching the ram and it was furious at it, and it struck the ram, and it broke its two horns, and _there was not strength in the ram to stand before him_, ^[Literally "and not was strength in the ram to withstand to the face of him"] and he threw it down to the ground and trampled it, _and there was no one who could rescue the ram_ ^[Literally "and not he/it was one rescuing"] from its power.

###### v8
And the he-goat grew _exceedingly great_, ^[Literally "until much"] and _at the height of its power_ ^[Literally "and at his being powerful"] the great horn was broken, and four conspicuous horns ^[LXX reads "others" here for "conspicuous." The words in Hebrew can be confused for each other] came up in place of it toward the four winds of heaven.

###### v9
_And from one of them_ ^[Literally "And from the one from them"] came forth _a_ horn, _a little one_, ^[Literally "one from little"] and it grew exceedingly ^[Or "pre-eminently"] toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beautiful land.

###### v10
And it grew up to the host of heaven, and it threw down to the ground some of the host and some of the stars and trampled them.

###### v11
Even against the prince of the hosts it acted arrogantly and took away from him the regular burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown.

###### v12
And on account of transgression, _the_ host was given over _to the horn_ in addition to the regular burnt offering. And it cast down truth to the ground, and it _acted_, ^[Literally "did"] and it had success.

###### v13
And I heard a certain holy one speaking, and a certain other holy one said to the specific one _who was speaking_, ^[Literally "the _one_ speaking"] "_For how long_ ^[Literally "Until when"] _is_ the vision _concerning_ the regular burnt offering, and the transgression _that_ makes desolate, and _the_ giving over _of the_ sanctuary and _the_ host to trampling?"

###### v14
And he said to me, "For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings, then _the_ sanctuary will be restored."

###### v15
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it happened"] when I, Daniel, saw the vision, and I was seeking understanding, there was _one_ standing before me with _the_ appearance of a man.

###### v16
And I heard _the_ voice of a human at _the_ Ulai, and he called and said, "Gabriel, _make_ this _man_ understand the vision."

###### v17
And he came beside _where I was standing_, ^[Literally "my standing"] and _when he came_ ^[Literally "at his coming"] I became terrified and I fell prostrate on my face. And he said to me, "Understand, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] that the vision _is_ for _the_ time of _the_ end."

###### v18
And _when he spoke_ ^[Literally "at his speaking"] with me I fell into a trance with my face to the ground, and he touched me and made me stand on by feet.

###### v19
And he said, "Look, I am making known to you what will happen in the period of wrath, ^[Or "the wrath"] for _it refers_ to _the_ appointed time of _the_ end.

###### v20
"The ram that you saw _who had two horns_ ^[Literally "the owner of the two horns"] _represents_ the kings of Media and Persia.

###### v21
"And the hairy he-goat _is_ the _kingdom_ ^[Literally "king"] of Greece, and the great horn that _is_ between his eyes--he _is_ the first king.

###### v22
And the _horn_ _that_ was broken, and _then_ there arose four _horns_ in place of it--_these are_ four kingdoms _that_ will arise from _his_ nation, but not with his power.

###### v23
And at the end of their kingdom, when the transgressions are completed, a king will arise, fierce in countenance and skilled in riddles.

###### v24
And his power will grow, but not by his _own_ power, and he will cause fearful destruction, and he will succeed and _he will act_, ^[Literally "he will do"] and he will destroy _the_ mighty and _the_ people of _the_ holy ones. ^[Or "saints"]

###### v25
And by his planning ^[Or "cunning"] he will make a success of deceit by ^[Hebrew "in"] his hand, and in his _mind_ ^[Literally "heart"] he will _boast_, ^[Literally "magnify himself"] and in _their_ ease he will destroy many, and _even_ against _the_ prince of princes he will rise up, and he will be broken, _but_ not by human hands.

###### v26
And the vision of the evening and the morning that has been _described_, ^[Literally "told"] it _is_ true; and you, seal _up_ the vision, for _it refers to many days to come_." ^[Literally "for to days many"]

###### v27
And I, Daniel, was overcome, and I became ill for _some_ days, and I _performed_ ^[Literally "did"] the business of the king, and I was dismayed over the vision and _I did not understand it_. ^[Literally "there was not understanding"]
