Lord, according to all your righteousness, please let your anger and your rage turn away from your city Jerusalem, _your holy mountain_, ^[Literally "the mountain of your holiness"] because through our sins and through the iniquities of our ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] Jerusalem and your people have become an object of mockery among all of our neighbors.

Incline your ear, my God, and listen; open your eyes and look at our desolation and the city that is called _by_ your name, for we _are_ not presenting our pleas for mercy _before you_ ^[Literally "to the face of you"] because of our righteousness, but _rather_ because of your great compassion.

###### v19
Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, pay heed and act! You must not delay _for your sake_, ^[Literally "for the sake of you"] my God; because _your city and your people are called by your name_." ^[Literally "your name is called over your city and over your people"]

Now I _was_ still speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] Yahweh my God, on behalf _of the holy mountain of my God_. ^[Literally "the mountain of the holiness of my God"]

###### v26
"And after the sixty and two weeks an anointed one ^[Or "messiah"] shall be cut off, and _he shall have nothing_, ^[Literally "there is not for him"] and _the_ people of the coming leader will destroy the city and the sanctuary, ^[Or "holy place"] and its end _will be_ with the flood and _on_ to _the_ end _there shall be_ war; _these_ desolations are determined.
