###### v1
In the third year of Cyrus _the_ king of _the_ Persians, a word ^[Or "matter," or "message"] was revealed to Daniel, who was called _by_ his name Belteshazzar, and the word ^[Or "matter," or "message"] _was_ reliable and _it concerned_ a great tribulation, ^[Or "conflict"] and he understood the word ^[Or "matter," or "message"] and _he received understanding_. ^[Literally "and understanding to him"]

###### v2
In those days, I, Daniel, I _myself_ ^[This is an emphatic use of the first person personal pronoun] was _in_ mourning _for three whole weeks_. ^[Literally "three weeks _of_ days"]

###### v3
I had not eaten _any_ choice food, and meat and wine did not enter my mouth, and _I did not use any ointment_ ^[Literally "I have not anointed at all"] _until the end of three whole weeks_. ^[Literally "until being full/complete three weeks _of_ days"]

###### v4
And _then_ on _the_ twenty-fourth day of the first month, I _myself_ ^[This is an emphatic use of the first person personal pronoun] was on the bank of the great river; that is, _the_ Tigris.

###### v5
And I lifted up my eyes and I saw, ^[Or "looked"] and there was a man, _and_ he was dressed _in_ linen, and his waist was girded with _the_ gold of Uphaz.

###### v6
Now his body _was_ like turquoise, ^[Or "yellow jasper" or other gold-colored stones; the exact identity of ancient precious stones is difficult] and his face _was_ like _the_ appearance of lightning, and his eyes _were_ like torches of fire, and his arms and his legs _were_ like _the_ gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words _was_ like _the_ sound of a multitude.

###### v7
And I saw, I, Daniel _alone_, ^[Literally "to alone me"] the vision; and the people who were with me _did not see_ ^[Literally "not they saw"] the vision; nevertheless, a great trembling fell upon them and they fled _in order_ to hide themselves.

###### v8
And I myself, Daniel, alone saw this great vision, and _as a result_ _no strength was left in me_ ^[Literally "not was left in me strength"] and _my complexion grew deathly pale_, ^[Literally "and complexion my changed over me to destruction"] and I did not retain any strength.

###### v9
And I heard the sound of his words, and _when I heard_ ^[Literally "at my hearing"] the sound of his words I myself _began_ falling into a trance on my face, _with my face to the ground_. ^[Literally "and my face toward the ground"]

###### v10
And look, a hand touched me and it roused me to my knees ^[Hebrew "on my knees"] and the palms ^[Hebrew "palm"] of my hands.

###### v11
And he said to me, "Daniel, _a_ man beloved, pay attention to the words that I _am_ speaking to you and _stand upright where you are_, ^[Literally "stand on your position"] for I have now been sent to you." And _while he was speaking_ ^[Literally "at his speaking"] with me this word, ^[Or "matter," or "message"] I stood up trembling.

###### v12
And he said to me, "You must not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] your God, your words were heard, and I _myself_ ^[This is an emphatic use of the first person personal pronoun] have come because of your words.

###### v13
But _the_ prince of _the_ kingdom of Persia stood _before me_ ^[Literally "to front of me"] _for_ twenty-one days. And look, ^[Or "finally"] Michael, one of the chief princes, came to assist me, and I left _him_ there beside _the_ king of _the_ Persians.

###### v14
And I have come ^[Hebrew "I came"] to instruct you about what ^[Hebrew "that"] will happen to your people _in the future_, ^[Literally "at the end of the days"] for _there is_ a further vision _here_ _for the future_. ^[Literally "for the days"]

###### v15
And while he was speaking with me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and I was speechless.

###### v16
Then look, there was _one in the form of a human_; ^[Literally "as _the_ likeness of _a_ son of man"] he touched my lips and I opened my mouth and I spoke and I said to the _one_ standing _before me_, ^[Literally "to opposite me"] "My lord, because of the vision my anxieties fell upon me and I _have_ not retained _my_ strength.

###### v17
So _how am I, a servant of my lord_ ^[Literally "how is _he_ able a servant _of_ my lord this"] to speak with _you, my lord_, ^[Literally "with my lord this"] and I _just now_ ^[Literally "from now"] _have no strength in me_?" ^[Literally "not it remains in me strength"]

###### v18
And _he again touched_ ^[Literally "he added to and touched"] me, _the one in the form of a human_, ^[Literally "like vision of a man"] and he strengthened me.

###### v19
And he said, "You must not fear, _O_ beloved man. _Peace be to you_; ^[Literally "Peace to/for you"] be strong and be courageous!" And _when he spoke_ ^[Literally "at his speaking"] with me, I was strengthened and I said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me."

###### v20
Then he asked, "Do you know why I have come to you? And now I return to fight against the prince of Persia and I _myself_ ^[This is an emphatic use of the first person personal pronoun] _am_ going, and look, ^[Or "listen"] _the_ prince of Javan ^[That is, Greece] will come.

###### v21
However, I will tell you _what is inscribed_ ^[Literally "the being inscribed"] in _the_ book of truth, and there is not one _who_ contends with me against these _beings_ _except_ ^[Literally "but if"] Michael, your prince."
