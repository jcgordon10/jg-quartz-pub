[[Dan-11|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
"Now at that time, Michael, the great prince, will arise, _the protector_ ^[Literally "the one who stands with"] over the sons of your people, and it will be a time of distress that has not been since _your people_ _have been_ ^[Literally "to be" or "being"] a nation until that time. And at that time your people will escape, _everyone who is found_ ^[Literally "all _of_ the being found"] written in the scroll. ^[Or "book"]

###### v2
And many from _those_ sleeping _in the dusty ground_ ^[Literally "_of the_ ground of dust"] will awake, some to _everlasting life_ ^[Literally "life of eternity"] and some to disgrace and _everlasting contempt_. ^[Literally "contempt _of_ eternity"]

###### v3
But the _ones_ having insight will shine like the brightness of the expanse, and _the ones_ providing justice _for_ the many ^[Or "leading the many in righteousness"] _will be_ like the stars _forever and ever_. ^[Literally "to eternity and ever"]

###### v4
But you, Daniel, keep the words secret and seal the scroll ^[Or "book"] until _the_ time of _the_ end; many will run back and forth and knowledge will increase."

###### v5
Then I looked, I myself, Daniel, and look, there were two others standing: _one on this bank of the stream and one on the other_. ^[Literally "one here on the bank of the stream and one there on the bank of the stream"]

###### v6
Then he said to the man _who_ was clothed in linen who _was_ above ^[Hebrew "from above"] the water of the stream, ^[Or "river"] "_How long until_ ^[Literally "Until when"] the end of the wonders?"

###### v7
And I heard the man _who_ was clothed in linen who _was_ above ^[Hebrew "from above"] the water of the stream, ^[Or "river"] and he raised his right hand and his left hand to heaven and he swore _by the one who lives forever_ ^[Literally "by the life of the eternity"] that _an_ appointed time, appointed times, and half _an appointed time_ _would pass_ when _the_ shattering of _the power of the holy people_ ^[Literally "_the_ power of _the_ people of holiness"] _would be completed_; ^[Literally "to come to an end"] _then_ all these things will be accomplished.

###### v8
Now I myself heard, but I _did_ not understand, and I said, "My lord, what _will be the_ outcome _of_ these _things_?"

###### v9
And he said, "Go, Daniel, for the words _are_ secret and _are_ sealed _up_ until _the_ time of _the_ end.

###### v10
Many will be purified and will be cleansed and will be refined, but _the_ wicked will act wickedly _and none of the wicked will understand_, ^[Literally "and not will understand all the wicked"] but _those who have insight_ ^[Literally "the _ones_ having insight"] will understand.

###### v11
And from _the_ time the regular burnt offering is removed and _the_ abomination that causes desolation _is set up_ ^[Literally "to be set up" or "to put in place"] _there will be_ one thousand two hundred and ninety days.

###### v12
Happy _is_ the _one who is_ persevering, and attains _to_ _the_ one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.

###### v13
But you, go _on_ to the end and rest, and you will arise for your allotted inheritance at the end of the days."
