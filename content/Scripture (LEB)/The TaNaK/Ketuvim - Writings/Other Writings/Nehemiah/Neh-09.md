###### v28
But when they had rest they returned to doing evil before you, and you abandoned them in the hand of their enemies, and they ruled over them. Then they returned and cried out to you, and from the heavens you heard and many times rescued them according to your compassions.

###### v29
You warned them so that they would return to your law. ^[Hebrew _torah_] Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to your commandments but sinned against your judgments that a person must do so that they may live. They turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not listen.

You are righteous in everything that has come on us, for you dealt faithfully, and we have acted wickedly.
