[[Neh-12|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
On that day the book of Moses was read in the hearing of the people and it was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God

###### v2
because they did not come to meet the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them in order to curse them--but our God changed the curse into a blessing.

###### v3
So it happened when they heard the law ^[Hebrew _torah_] that they separated all of the foreign people from Israel.

###### v4
Before this, Eliashib the priest who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God--the one related to Tobiah--

###### v5
prepared for _Tobiah_ a large chamber where they had formerly put the grain offering, the frankincense, the _temple_ objects, tithes of grain, wine, and oil commanded for the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the offerings of the priests.

###### v6
During all of this, I was not in Jerusalem because in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. At the end of _some_ days I asked permission from the king _to leave_.

###### v7
So I came to Jerusalem. And I came to learn of the wrong that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by making him a room in the courtyard of the house of God.

###### v8
It was very displeasing for me, and I threw all of the objects from the house of Tobiah outside of the chamber.

###### v9
And I spoke _in order_, and they cleansed the chambers. Then I returned the objects of the house of God--the grain offering and the frankincense.

###### v10
And then I came to learn that the food of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers, the doers of the work, had gone back each to his field.

###### v11
So I quarreled with the prefects, and I said, "Why is the house of God forsaken?" And I gathered them and set them at their station.

###### v12
So all of Judah brought the tithe of grain, new wine, and olive oil into the storehouses.

###### v13
I appointed as treasurer over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Pedaiah from the Levites, and as their hand Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for they were considered faithful. _The responsibility given_ to them was to distribute to their brothers.

###### v14
Remember me, my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my loyal acts which I have done in the house of my God and in his service.

###### v15
In those days I saw in Judah _people_ treading the wine press on the Sabbath, bringing in heaps _of grain_ and loading them on donkeys along with wine, grapes and figs, and every kind of burden and bringing _it all_ to Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath. And I warned them at that time against selling food.

###### v16
Tyrian men who lived in _Jerusalem_ brought fish and every kind of merchandise and sold _it_ on the Sabbath to the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Judah and in Jerusalem.

###### v17
So I quarreled with the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the day of the Sabbath?

###### v18
Did not your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] do this also, and our God brought on us all of this disaster and on this city _too_? Now you are adding fierce wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath!"

###### v19
So when it became dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors be shut and said that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I appointed some of my young men over the gates _to prevent_ any _goods_ ^[Literally "burden"] being brought in on the day of the Sabbath.

###### v20
So the merchants and the sellers of merchandise spent the night outside of Jerusalem once or twice.

###### v21
But I warned them and said to them, "Why are you spending the night opposite the wall? If you do _it again_, I will lay hands against you." From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.

###### v22
And then I told two Levites that they must purify themselves and come to guard the gates in order to consecrate the day of the Sabbath. Remember this also, my God, and take pity on me according to the greatness of your loyal love.

###### v23
Also in those days I saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.

###### v24
Half of their children spoke Ashdodite and could not speak Judean, but _only_ the tongues of other nations.

###### v25
So I quarreled with them and cursed them and beat some of their men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath by God: "Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.

###### v26
Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in this way? And among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Yet the foreign women made even him sin.

###### v27
Should we listen to you all and do this great evil, acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?"

###### v28
One from the sons of Jehoiada, son of the high priest Eliashib, _who was_ the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonote _was there_. I chased him away from me.

###### v29
Remember them, my God, because of their defilements of the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.

###### v30
So I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established responsibilities for the priests and Levites, each in his own work,

###### v31
a contribution of the wood offering at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.
