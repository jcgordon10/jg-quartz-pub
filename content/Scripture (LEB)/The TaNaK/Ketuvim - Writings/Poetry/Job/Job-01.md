[[Job-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
_There_ was a man in the land of Uz whose ^[Hebrew "his"] name _was_ Job. That ^[Hebrew "And that"] man was blameless and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.

###### v2
And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.

###### v3
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] his livestock came to be seven thousand sheep and goats and three thousand camels and five hundred pairs ^[Hebrew "pair"] of oxen and five hundred female donkeys, and he had very many slaves, and that man was greater than all the people of the east.

###### v4
And his sons used to go and hold a feast _at each other's house_ ^[Literally "at the house of a man," or "at the house of each"] on his day, and they would send, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.

###### v5
_Then when_ ^[Literally "And it would happen that," or "And it would happen when"] the days of the feast had run their course, _Job would send_, ^[Literally "and Job would send"] and he would sanctify them. Thus ^[Hebrew "And"] he would arise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings _according to_ the number of all of them, because Job thought, ^[Or "said"] "Perhaps my children have sinned and _cursed_ ^[Literally "blessed"-- negative meaning by context] God in their heart." This is what Job used to do _all the time_. ^[Or "always"; literally "all the days"]

###### v6
And it happened _one day_ ^[Literally "the day"] _that_ ^[Literally "and"] the sons of God ^[Or "the heavenly beings," or "the angels"] came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] also came into their midst.

###### v7
So ^[Hebrew "And"] Yahweh said to Satan, ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] "From where have you come?"
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Satan ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] answered Yahweh and said, "From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it."

###### v8
So ^[Hebrew "And"] Yahweh said to Satan, ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] "Have you _considered_ ^[Literally "set your heart"] my servant Job? Indeed, ^[Or "For," or "Because"] there is no one like him on the earth--a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil."

###### v9
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Satan ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] answered Yahweh and said, "Does Job fear God for nothing?

###### v10
Have you ^[Emphatic personal pronoun could be translated "you yourself"] not put a fence around him and his household and around _all that belongs to him_ ^[Literally "all that _is_ his"] _on every side_? ^[Literally "from around"] You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock ^[Or "possessions"] has increased in the land.

###### v11
But, ^[Hebrew "And"] on the other hand, stretch out ^[Or "please"] your hand and touch _all that belongs to him_ ^[Literally "all that _is_ his"] _and see_ _whether_ ^[Literally "if not"] he will _curse_ ^[Literally "bless"-- negative meaning by context] you to your face."

###### v12
So ^[Hebrew "And"] Yahweh said to Satan, ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] "Look, _all that belongs to him_ ^[Literally "all that _is_ his"] is in your _power_. ^[Literally "hand"] Only do not stretch out your hand _against_ ^[Literally "to," or "unto"] him." So ^[Hebrew "And"] Satan ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] went out from Yahweh's _presence_. ^[Literally "faces of"]

###### v13
And then _there_ was one day when ^[Hebrew "and"] his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother's house.

###### v14
And a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing, and the female donkeys were feeding _beside them_. ^[Literally "on their hands"]

###### v15
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] the Sabeans _attacked_, ^[Literally "fell _upon them_"] and they took them, and they slew the servants _by the edge of the sword_. ^[Literally "with the mouth of _the_ sword"] But ^[Hebrew "And"] I escaped, _even_ I alone, to tell you."

###### v16
While this one was still speaking, _another_ ^[Literally "this"] came and said, "The fire of God fell from the heavens, and it blazed up against the sheep and goats and against the servants, and it consumed them. But I escaped, _even_ I alone, to tell you."

###### v17
While this one was still speaking, _another_ ^[Literally "this"] came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three divisions, and they made a raid on the camels, and they carried them away, and they struck your servants _by the edge of the sword_, ^[Literally "with the mouth of _the_ sword"] but I escaped, _even_ I alone, to tell you."

###### v18
At the time ^[Hebrew "Until"] this one was speaking, _another_ ^[Literally "this"] came and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother's house.

###### v19
And behold, ^[Or "Look"] a great wind came from across the desert, and it struck the four corners of the house _so that_ ^[Literally "and"] it fell upon the young people, and they died. But I escaped, _even_ I alone, to tell you."

###### v20
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Job arose and tore his outer garment ^[Or "robe"] and shaved his head; _then_ ^[Hebrew "and"] he fell upon the ground and he worshiped.

###### v21
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] he said, "Naked I came out from my mother's womb, and naked I will return there. Yahweh gives, and Yahweh takes. Let Yahweh's name be blessed."

###### v22
In all this, Job did not sin and did not _charge God with wrongdoing_. ^[Literally "give unseemliness to God"]
