###### v1
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it came to be," or "and it happened"] one day the sons of God ^[Or "the heavenly beings," or "the angels"] came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] also came into their midst to present himself before Yahweh.

###### v2
So ^[Hebrew "And"] Yahweh _asked_ ^[Literally "said to"] Satan, ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] "From where have you come?"
And Satan ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] answered Yahweh and said, "From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it."

###### v3
So ^[Hebrew "And"] Yahweh _asked_ ^[Literally "said to"] Satan, ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] "Have you _considered_ ^[Literally "set your heart"] my servant Job? Indeed, ^[Or "For" or "Because"] there is no one like him on the earth--a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil. And still he persists in his blamelessness _even though_ ^[Hebrew "and"] you incited me against him to destroy him for nothing."

###### v4
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Satan ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] answered him and said, "Skin for skin! All that _that_ ^[Literally "the"] man has he will give for his life.

###### v5
But stretch out ^[Or "please"] your hand and touch his bones and his flesh, _and see_ _whether_ ^[Literally "if not"] he will _curse_ ^[Literally "bless"--negative meaning by context] you to your face." ^[Hebrew "your faces"]

###### v6
So ^[Literally "And it happened the/one day"] Yahweh said to Satan, ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] "_All right_, ^[Literally "Look"] he _is_ in your _power_. ^[Literally "hand"] Only spare his life."

###### v7
So ^[Hebrew "And"] Satan ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] went out from _Yahweh's presence_, ^[Literally "the faces of Yahweh"] and he inflicted Job with loathsome skin sores from the sole of his foot up to the crown of his head.

###### v8
_So_ ^[Hebrew "And"] he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat in the midst of the ashes.

###### v9
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] his wife said to him, "Are you still persisting in your blamelessness? _Curse_ ^[Literally "Bless"--negative meaning by context] God and die."

###### v10
So ^[Hebrew "And"] he said to her, "You speak like one of the foolish women speaks. Indeed, should we receive the good from God, but ^[Or "and"] not receive the evil?" In all this, Job did not sin with his lips.

###### v11
Thus ^[Hebrew "And"] Job's three friends heard of this calamity that had come upon him. So ^[Hebrew "And"] each set out from his _own_ place: Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite. And they met ^[Or "they agreed"] together to come to console him and to comfort him.

###### v12
Thus ^[Hebrew "And"] they lifted up their eyes ^[Or "they gazed"] from afar, but ^[Hebrew "and"] they did not recognize him, so ^[Hebrew "and"] they raised their voice, and they wept, and each man tore his outer garment ^[Or "robe"] and threw dust on their heads _toward the sky_. ^[Or "in the air"; literally "to the heavens"]

###### v13
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] they sat with him on the ground _for_ seven days and seven nights, but ^[Hebrew "and"] no one spoke ^[Or "there was no speaking"] a word to him because they saw that _his_ ^[Literally "the"] suffering was very great.
