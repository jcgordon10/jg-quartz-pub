###### v1
_Afterward_ ^[Literally "After thus"] Job opened his mouth and cursed ^[A different term than that employed in 1:5, 11; 2:5, 9] his day.

###### v2
Thus ^[Hebrew "And"] Job _spoke up_ ^[Literally "answered"] and said,

###### v3
"Let _the_ day perish on which I was born,
and the night that said, 'A man-child is conceived.'

###### v4
Let that day become ^[Or "be"] darkness;
may God not seek it from above,
nor may daylight shine on it.

###### v5
Let darkness and deep shadow claim it;
let clouds ^[Literally "cloud"] settle on it;
let them ^[Masculine plural referring to all three entities mentioned in this verse] terrify it _with the_ blackness ^[Literally "blacknesses"] of day.

###### v6
Let darkness seize that night; ^[Literally "That night, let darkness seize it"]
let it not rejoice among _the_ days of _the_ year;
let it not enter among _the_ number of _the_ months.

###### v7
Look, let that night become ^[Or "be"] barren;
let a joyful song not enter it.

###### v8
Let those who curse the day curse it,
those who are skilled at rousing Leviathan.

###### v9
Let the stars of its dawn be dark;
let it hope for light but ^[Hebrew "and"] there be none,
and let it not see _the_ eyelids of dawn

###### v10
because it did not shut the doors of my _mother's_ womb,
nor ^[Hebrew "And"] did it hide trouble from my eyes.

###### v11
"Why did I not die at ^[Literally "from"] birth?
_Why_ did I _not_ come forth from _the_ womb and expire?

###### v12
Why did _the_ knees receive me
and the breasts, that I could suck?

###### v13
For now I would lie down, and I would be at peace;
I would be asleep; then _I would be at rest_ ^[Literally "it would be at rest for me"]

###### v14
with kings and counselors of _the_ earth,
who _rebuild_  ^[Literally "build"] ruins for themselves,

###### v15
or with high officials _who have gold_, ^[Literally "gold _is_ for them"]
who fill up their houses _with_ silver.

###### v16
Or _why_ was I not hidden like a miscarriage,
like infants _who_ did not see _the_ light?

###### v17
There _the_ wicked cease from troubling,
and there _the_ _weary_ ^[Literally "weary of strength"] are at rest;

###### v18
_the_ prisoners are at ease together;
they do not hear _the_ oppressor's voice.

###### v19
_The_ small and _the_ great _are_ there,
and _the_ slave _is_ free from his masters. ^[Or "master"]

###### v20
"Why does he ^[Most likely God] give light to one in misery
and life to _those_ bitter of soul,

###### v21
who wait for death, but ^[Hebrew "and"] _it does not come_, ^[Literally "it _is_ not"]
and search ^[Or "dig"] _for_ it more than _for_ treasures,

###### v22
who rejoice _exceedingly_, ^[Literally "unto rejoicing"]
_and_ they are glad when they find _the_ grave?

###### v23
_Why does he ^[Most likely God] give light_ to a man whose way is hidden,
and God has fenced him in _all_ around?

###### v24
For ^[Or perhaps emphatic, "Indeed"] my sighing comes _before_ ^[Or "in place of" (NET); literally "to the faces of"] my bread, ^[Or "food"]
and my groanings gush forth like water

###### v25
because the dread that I _feel_ ^[Literally "dread"] has come upon me,
and what I feared befalls me.

###### v26
I am not at ease, and I am not at peace,
and I do not have rest, thus ^[Hebrew "and"] turmoil has come."
