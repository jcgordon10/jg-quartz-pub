###### v2

and you have strengthened weak hands.

###### v4
Your words have raised up _the one who_ stumbles,
and you have strengthened knees giving way.

###### v5
But now it has come to you, and you are worn out;

###### v6
_Is_ not your fear _in God_ your confidence?
_Is not_ your hope even ^[Hebrew "and"] the integrity of your ways?

Or ^[Hebrew "And"] where _are_ the upright destroyed?

###### v8
_Just_ as I have seen, plowers of mischief
and sowers of trouble will reap it.

By ^[Or "From"] the breath of God they perish,
and by ^[Or "from"] the blast of his anger they come to an end.

and _the_ lion's whelps are scattered.

and my ear received _the_ whisper from it.

###### v13
Amid troubling thoughts from night visions,
at _the_ falling of deep sleep on men,

###### v14
dread met me, and trembling,
and it made many of my bones shake.

###### v15
And a spirit glided before my face;
the hair of my flesh ^[Or "body"] bristled.

###### v16
It stood still, but ^[Hebrew "and"] I could not recognize its appearance;
a form _was_ _before_ ^[Literally "to before"] my eyes;
_there was_ a hush, and I heard a voice:

###### v17
'Can a human being be more righteous than God,
or can a man be more pure than his Maker?

###### v18
Look, he does not trust in his servants
and he charges his angels with error.

###### v19
How much more dwellers in clay houses,
whose foundation _is_ in the dust?
They are crushed like a moth.

###### v20
_Between morning and evening_ ^[Literally "from morning to the evening"] they are destroyed;
without _anyone_ regarding _it_ they perish forever.

###### v21
_Is_ not their tent cord pulled up within them?
They die, but ^[Hebrew "and"] not in ^[Or "with"] wisdom.'
