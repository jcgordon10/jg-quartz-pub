###### v1
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Job answered and said,

###### v2
"If only my vexation could be well weighed,
and my calamity could be lifted up together _with it_ in _the_ balances,

###### v3
for then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas;
therefore my words have been rash,

###### v4
for the arrows of Shaddai _are_ in me;
my spirit drinks their poison;
the terrors of God are arrayed against me.

###### v5
Does _the_ wild ass bray over grass,
or _the_ ox bellow over its fodder?

###### v6
Can tasteless _food_ be eaten without ^[Hebrew "from without"] salt,
or is there taste in the white of a marshmallow plant?

###### v7
_I refused_ ^[Literally "My soul/throat refuses"] to touch _them_;
they _are_ like _food that will make me ill_. ^[Literally "the illness of my bread/food"]

###### v8
"_O that_ ^[Literally "Who would give"] my request may come,
and _that_ God may grant my hope,

###### v9
that ^[Hebrew "and"] God would decide that ^[Hebrew "and"] he would crush me,
_that_ he would let loose his hand and _kill me_. ^[Literally "he would cut me off"]

###### v10
But ^[Hebrew "And"] it will still be my consolation,
and I would recoil in _unrelenting_ ^[Literally "he/it does not have compassion," or "he/it does not have pity," or "he/it does not spare"] pain,
for I have not denied _the_ words of _the_ Holy One.

###### v11
What _is_ my strength, that I should wait?
And what _is_ my end, that _I should hold out_? ^[Literally "I should make my self long," or "I should lengthen my self"]

###### v12
Or _is_ my strength _like_ the strength of stones?
Or _is_ my flesh bronze?

###### v13
_Indeed_, ^[An interrogative marker plus "if"] my help is not in me,
and _any_ success is driven from me.

###### v14
"Loyal love ^[Or "Kindness"] _should come_ for the afflicted _from_ his friend,
even if ^[Hebrew "and"] he forsakes the fear of Shaddai.

###### v15
My companions are treacherous like a torrent-bed;
like a streambed of wadis ^[A seasonal stream that is often dry] they flow away,

###### v16
which are growing dark because of ice upon them,
it will pile up snow.

###### v17
In time they dry up, they disappear;
when it _is_ hot, they vanish from their place.

###### v18
The paths of their way wind _around_;
they go up into the wasteland, and they perish.

###### v19
The caravans of Tema looked;
the traveling merchants of Sheba hope for them.

###### v20
They are disappointed, because they trusted;
they came _here_ ^[Literally "up to it"] and they are confounded.

###### v21
"For now you ^[Plural throughout the rest of this chapter] have become _such_; ^[Literally "to it," or "for it"]
you see terrors, and you fear.

###### v22
Is it because I have said, 'Give to me,'
or, ^[Hebrew "and"] 'Offer a bribe for me from your wealth'?

###### v23
or, ^[Hebrew "and"] 'Save me from the foe's hand,'
or, ^[Hebrew "And"] 'Ransom me from the tyrants' hand'?

###### v24
Teach me, and I myself ^[Emphatic personal pronoun] will be silent;
and make me understand how I have gone astray.

###### v25
How painful are _upright words_! ^[Literally "words of uprightness"]
But ^[Hebrew "And"] what does _your reproof_ ^[Literally "reproving from you"] reprove?

###### v26
Do you intend to reprove _my_ words ^[Or "Do you intend to reprove _with_ words"]
and _consider the_ words of a desperate _man_ as wind?

###### v27
Even over _the_ orphan you would cast the lot,
and you would bargain over your friend.

###### v28
"_Therefore_ ^[Literally "And now," or "And so then"] be prepared, turn to me,
and I surely will not lie to your face. ^[Hebrew "faces"]

###### v29
Please turn, let no injustice happen;
indeed, ^[Hebrew "and"] turn, _my righteousness is still intact_. ^[Literally "still my righteousness _is_ in it"]

###### v30
Is there injustice on my tongue?
Or can my palate not discern calamity? ^[Or "calamities"]
