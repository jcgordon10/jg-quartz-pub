###### v1
"Does not _a human being ^[Or a collective singular, "human beings"] have hard service_ ^[Literally "hard service for a human being"] on earth?
And _are not_ his ^[Or a collective singular, "their"] days like the days of a laborer?

###### v2
Like a slave he longs for _the_ shadow,
and like a laborer he waits for his wages.

###### v3
So _I had to inherit_ ^[Literally "I am allotted to me"] months of worthlessness,
and nights of misery are apportioned to me.

###### v4
When I lie down, I say, ^[Hebrew "and I say"] 'When shall I rise?'
But ^[Hebrew "And"] _the_ night is long,
and I have my fill of tossing until dawn.

###### v5
My body is clothed _with_ maggots and clods of dust;
my skin hardens, then ^[Hebrew "and"] it gives way _again_.

###### v6
"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,
and they come to an end _without hope_. ^[Literally "with nothing hope"]

###### v7
Remember that my life _is_ a breath;
my eye will not return to see good.

###### v8
The eye of _the one_ seeing me will not see me;
your eyes _are_ upon me, but ^[Hebrew "and"] _I will be gone_. ^[Literally "there is not me," or "I am not"]

###### v9
A cloud vanishes, and it goes away,
so _he who_ goes down to Sheol will not come up.

###### v10
He does not return again to his house,
and his place does not recognize him again.

###### v11
"Even ^[Or "I on my part"] I will not restrain my mouth;
I will speak in my spirit's anguish;
I will complain in my inner self's ^[Or "soul's"] bitterness.

###### v12
Am I _the_ sea, or a sea monster,
that you set a guard over me?

###### v13
When I say, 'My bed will comfort me,
and my couch ^[Or "bed"] will ease my complaint,'

###### v14
then ^[Hebrew "and"] you terrify me with dreams, ^[Or "the dreams"]
and with visions you terrify ^[Or "dishearten," or "frighten"] me.

###### v15
So ^[Or "And"] my inner self ^[Or "soul"] will choose ^[Or "I will choose"] strangling--
death more than my _existence_. ^[Literally "bones"]

###### v16
I loathe _my life_; I would not live forever;
depart from me, for my days _are_ a breath.

###### v17
"What _is_ a human being that you make him great
and that _you fix your mind on him_, ^[Literally "you set on him your heart"]

###### v18
so that ^[Hebrew "and"] you visit him _every morning_, ^[Literally "for mornings," or "at mornings"]
you test him _every moment_? ^[Literally "for moments," or "at moments"]

###### v19
_How long_ ^[Literally "Like what"] will you not turn away from me?
_Or_ not leave me alone until I swallow ^[Or "my swallowing"] my spit?

###### v20
_If_ I have sinned, what have I done to you, watcher of humanity?
Why have you made me as a target for yourself,
so that ^[Hebrew "and"] I have become a burden to myself? ^[Some translations translate as "you" (e.g., ESV, NRSV, NIV, NET)]

###### v21
And why do you not pardon my transgression
and take away my guilt?
For now I shall lie in the dust,
and you will seek me, but ^[Hebrew "and"] _I will be no more_." ^[Literally "there is not me," or "I am not"]
