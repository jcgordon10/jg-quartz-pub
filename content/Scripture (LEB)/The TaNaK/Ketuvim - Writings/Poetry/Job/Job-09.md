###### v1
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Job answered and said,

###### v2
"Truly I know that _it is_ so,
but ^[Hebrew "and"] how can a human being be just before God?

###### v3
If he wants to contend with him,
he cannot answer him one _time_ in a thousand.

###### v4
_He is_ wise in ^[Hebrew "of"] heart and mighty in ^[Hebrew "of"] strength;
who has resisted him and succeeded? ^[Literally "he succeeded"]

###### v5
"_He is the one_ who moves mountains, and they do not know _how_,
who overturns them in his anger.

###### v6
_He is the one_ who shakes _the_ earth from its place,
and its pillars tremble.

###### v7
_He is the one_ who commands the sun, and it does not rise,
_and he seals up the stars_. ^[Literally "and behind _the_ stars he seals up"]

###### v8
_He is the one_ who alone stretches out _the_ heavens
and _who_ tramples on _the_ waves of _the_ sea.

###### v9
_He is the one_ who made _the_ Bear _and_ Orion,
_the_ Pleiades and _the_ constellations of _the_ south.

###### v10
_He is the one_ who does great things _beyond understanding_ ^[Literally "until there is not understanding"]
and marvelous things _beyond number_. ^[Literally "until there is not number"]

###### v11
"_If_ ^[Literally "Look"] he passes by me, _I would not see him_; ^[Literally "and I would not see"]
and _if_ he should move on, _I would not recognize him_. ^[Literally "and I would not recognize him"]

###### v12
_If_ ^[Literally "Look"] he would snatch away, who could turn him?
Who could say to him, 'What are you doing?'

###### v13
God will not turn back his anger;
beneath him the helpers of Rahab bow.

###### v14
_How much less_ ^[Literally "Also for"] can I myself ^[Emphatic personal pronoun] answer him?
_How_ can I choose my words with him,

###### v15
whom I cannot answer, even though I am righteous?
From ^[Hebrew "To"] my judge I must implore grace.

###### v16
If I summon _him_, and he should answer me,
I do not believe that he will listen to my voice--

###### v17
who crushes me with a tempest
and multiplies ^[Hebrew "he multiplies"] my wounds without cause.

###### v18
He will not allow me to _catch_ ^[Literally "return," or "regain"] my breath;
rather, he will fill me with bitterness.

###### v19
If _it is a matter of_ ^[Literally "for"; see NASB, NIV, NET] strength, look, _he is_ mighty.
But ^[Hebrew "And"] if _it is a matter of_ ^[Literally "for"; NASB, NIV, NET, NRSV] justice, who can summon me? ^[Or "arraign me"]

###### v20
Even though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me;
_even though_ I _am_ blameless, yet ^[Hebrew "and"] it would pronounce me guilty.

###### v21
"I _am_ blameless; I do not care about myself; ^[Perhaps the meaning is "but it makes no difference to me" (NLT)]
I loathe my life.

###### v22
It _is all_ one; therefore I say,
'He destroys _both the_ blameless and _the_ wicked.'

###### v23
When the whip ^[Or "scourge"] kills suddenly,
he mocks at _the_ despair of _the_ innocent.

###### v24
The earth is given into _the_ hand of _the_ wicked;
he covers the face of its judge--
if _it is_ not _he_, then who _is_ it?

###### v25
"And my days are swifter than a runner;
they flee away; they do not see good.

###### v26
They go by like papyrus skiffs,
like an eagle swoops down on _its_ prey.

###### v27
Though ^[Or "If"] _I say_, ^[Literally "my saying"] 'I will forget my complaint;
I will change my expression, and I will rejoice,'

###### v28
I become afraid of all my sufferings;
I know that you do not consider me innocent.

###### v29
_If_ I shall be _declared_ guilty,
why then should I labor in vain?

###### v30
If I wash myself with soap, ^[Or "with snow," or "in snow"]
and I cleanse my hands with lye,

###### v31
then you plunge me into the _slime_ pit,
and my clothes abhor me.

###### v32
"For ^[Or the emphatic "Indeed"] _he is_ not a mortal like me _that_ I can answer him,
_that_ _we can come to trial together_. ^[Literally "we come together in the justice," or "we come together in the judgment"]

###### v33
There is no arbiter between us
_that_ he might lay his hand on both of us.

###### v34
May he remove his rod from me,
and let his dread not terrify me;

###### v35
_then_ I would speak and not fear him, ^[Hebrew "and I will not fear him"]
for _in myself I am not fearful_. ^[Literally "not so I with me"]
