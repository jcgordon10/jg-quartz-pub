###### v2
I will say to God, 'You should not condemn me;
let me know why you contend _against_ me.

or your years as the days of man,

###### v6
that you seek out my iniquity,

because of your knowledge that I am not guilty,
and there is no escaping from your hand?

then ^[Or "and"] you destroyed me.

Please ^[Or an untranslatable particle expressing urgency] remember that you made me like clay,
but ^[Hebrew "and"] you turn me into dust _again_?

###### v10
Did you not pour me out like milk
and _curdle me_ ^[Literally "you did curdle me"] like cheese?

###### v12
You have granted me life and loyal love,
and your care has preserved my spirit.

"'Yet ^[Hebrew "And"] you hid these _things_ in your heart;
I know that this _was your purpose_. ^[Literally "_was_ with you"]

If I had sinned, then ^[Hebrew "and"] you would be watching me,
and you would not acquit me of my guilt.

###### v15
If I am guilty, woe to me!
But ^[Hebrew "And"] if I am righteous, I dare not lift my head;
_I am_ filled _with_ shame, and _just_ look _at_ my misery!

###### v16
And _if my head_ grows bold, you would hunt me as the lion in its prime;
_and you repeat your exploits against me_. ^[Literally "and you do again you display marvelous powers against me"]

You renew your witnesses against me,
and you increase your vexation against me;
_relief forces_ ^[Literally "substitute and force_s_"] _are_ against me.

###### v18
So ^[Hebrew "And"] why did you bring me forth from the womb?
I should have passed away, _and no eye should have seen me_. ^[Literally "and an eye should not have seen me"]
