###### v1
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,

###### v2
"Should an abundance of words go unanswered,
or _a man full of talk_ ^[Literally "a man of lips"] be vindicated? ^[Hebrew "should he be vindicated"]

###### v3
Should your loose talk put people to silence?
_And when you mock, shall no one put you to shame_? ^[Literally "And you will mock there is not putting to shame"]

###### v4
For you say, 'My teaching _is_ pure,
and I am clean in your sight.'

###### v5
But, ^[Hebrew "And but"] _O that_ ^[Literally "who shall give"] God might speak,
and _that_ he would open his lips to you,

###### v6
and _that_ he would tell you _the_ secrets of wisdom,
for _insight has many sides_. ^[Literally "double to sound wisdom"]
And know that God _on your behalf_ ^[Literally "for you"] has forgotten _some of_ ^[Literally "from"] your guilt.

###### v7
"Can you find _out_ the essence of God,
or can you find _out_ _the ultimate limits_ ^[Literally "up to _the_ limit"] of Shaddai?

###### v8
_It is higher than the heaven_; ^[Literally "heights of heaven"] what can you do?
_It is_ deeper than Sheol; what can you know?

###### v9
Its measure _is_ longer than _the_ earth
and broader than _the_ sea.

###### v10
"If he passes through and imprisons someone ^[Hebrew "and he imprisons"]
_and summons the assembly_, ^[Literally "and he summons"] then ^[Hebrew "and"] who can hinder him?

###### v11
For he knows _those who are worthless_; ^[Literally "men of worthlessness"]
_when he sees_ ^[Literally "And he will see"] iniquity, _he will not consider it_. ^[Literally "and he will not consider"]

###### v12
But ^[Hebrew "And"] _an empty-headed person_ ^[Literally "a man hollowed out"] will get understanding
when ^[Hebrew "and"] a wild donkey's colt is born _as_ a human being.

###### v13
"If you yourself ^[Emphatic personal pronoun] direct your heart
and stretch out your hands to him--

###### v14
if iniquity ^[See v. [[Job-11#v11|11]], where the same word is used] _is_ in your hand, put it far away,
and you must not let wickedness reside in your tents--

###### v15
surely then you will lift up your face without ^[Hebrew "from"] blemish,
and you will be firmly established and will not fear. ^[Hebrew "and not will you fear"]

###### v16
For you yourself ^[Emphatic personal pronoun] will forget your misery;
you will remember _it_ as water _that_ has flowed past.

###### v17
"_And your life will be brighter than noon_; ^[Literally "And from noon lifespan will arise"]
_its_ darkness will be like the morning.

###### v18
And you will have confidence because there is hope;
and you will be well protected--_you will sleep in safety_. ^[Literally "you will lie down securely"]

###### v19
And you will lie down, and _no one will make you afraid_; ^[Literally "there is not making afraid"]
_and many will entreat your favor_. ^[Literally "and they will appease/implore your faces many"]

###### v20
But ^[Hebrew "And"] _the_ eyes of _the_ wicked will fail;
and refuge will be lost to them,
and their hope _is_ _to breathe their last breath_." ^[Literally "the expiring of soul"]
