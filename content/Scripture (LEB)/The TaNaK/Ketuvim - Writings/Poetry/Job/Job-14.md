"A human being born of a woman
_is_ short of days and full of troubles. ^[Literally "trouble"]

and you bring me into judgment with you.

"Who can bring a clean _thing_ from an unclean _thing_?

until he enjoys his days like a laborer.

###### v7
"Indeed, there is hope for a tree:
if it is cut down, then ^[Hebrew "and"] it will sprout again,
and its new shoots will not cease;

###### v8
though its root grows old in the earth,
and its stump dies in the dust,

###### v9
at ^[Hebrew "from"] the scent of water it will bud,
and it will put forth branches like a young plant.

_Until the heavens are no more_, ^[Literally "Until not heavens"] they will not awaken,
and they will not be roused out of their sleep.

###### v13
"_O that_ ^[Literally "Who shall give"] you would conceal me in Sheol,
_that_ you would hide me _until your wrath is past_, ^[Literally "until the return of your nose"]
_that_ you would appoint a set time for me and remember me.

###### v14
If a man dies, will he live _again_?
All the days of my compulsory service I will wait,
until the coming of my relief.

###### v15
You would call, and I myself ^[Emphatic personal pronoun] would answer you;
you would long for the work of your hand.

###### v16
For then ^[Hebrew "now"] you would count my steps,
_but_ you would not keep watch over my sin.

###### v17
My transgression would be sealed in a bag,
and you would cover over my guilt.

###### v18
"But ^[Or "And but"] a mountain falls; it crumbles away,
and a rock moves away from its place.

Water wears away stones;
its torrents wash away _the_ soil of _the_ earth;
so ^[Hebrew "and"] you destroy the hope of human beings.

_you_ change _his countenance_, ^[Literally "his faces"] _then_ ^[Hebrew "and"] you send him away.

His children may _come to_ honor, but ^[Hebrew "and"] he does not know _it_;
or ^[Hebrew "and"] they may become lowly, but ^[Hebrew "and"] he does not realize it. ^[Or "them"]

He feels only the pain of his own body, ^[Hebrew "his body on him"]
and his inner self ^[Or "soul"] mourns for him." ^[Or "for himself"]
