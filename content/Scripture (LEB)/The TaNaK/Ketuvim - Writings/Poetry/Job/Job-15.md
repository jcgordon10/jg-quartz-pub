###### v1
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

###### v2
"Should _the_ wise answer _with_ windy knowledge,
and should he fill his stomach _with the_ east wind?

###### v3
Should he argue in talk _that_ is not profitable
or _in_ words with which he cannot do good?

###### v4
"_What is worse_, ^[Literally "Also," or "Even"] you yourself ^[Emphatic personal pronoun] are doing away with fear,
and you are lessening meditation _before_ ^[Literally "to the faces of"] God.

###### v5
For your iniquity teaches your mouth,
and you choose _the_ tongue of _the_ crafty.

###### v6
Your mouth condemns you, and not I;
and your lips testify against you.

###### v7
"Were you born the firstborn of the human race?
And were you brought forth _before_ ^[Literally "to the faces of"] _the_ hills?

###### v8
Have you listened in God's confidential discussion?
And do you limit wisdom to yourself?

###### v9
What do you know that we do not know?
_What_ do you understand that _is_ not clear to us?

###### v10
Both _the_ gray-haired and _the_ old _are_ among us--
_those older than your father_. ^[Literally "more aged than your father _in_ days"]

###### v11
"Are the consolations of God too small for you,
a word _spoken_ gently with you?

###### v12
Why does your heart carry you away?
And why do your eyes flash,

###### v13
that you turn your spirit against God,
and you let _such_ words go out of your mouth?

###### v14
"What _is_ a human being, that he can be clean,
or ^[Or "and"] that _one_ born of a woman can be righteous?

###### v15
Look, he does not trust his holy ones,
and _the_ heavens are not clean in his eyes.

###### v16
_How much less_ ^[Literally "Also for," or "Indeed for," or "Indeed that"] he who is abominable and corrupt, ^[Or "he who is corrupt"]
a man drinking wickedness like water.

###### v17
"I will show you, listen to me;
and what I have seen, I will tell ^[Literally "and I will tell"]--

###### v18
what wise men have told,
and they have not hidden _that which is_ from their ancestors,

###### v19
_to whom alone_ ^[Literally "to them to alone them"] the land was given,
and no stranger passed through their midst.

###### v20
"All of the wicked _one's_ days he is writhing,
even ^[Hebrew "and"] _through_ the number of years that are laid up for the tyrant.

###### v21
Sounds of terror _are_ in his ears;
in prosperity _the_ destroyer will come _against_ him.

###### v22
_He cannot trust that he will return_ ^[Literally "He cannot trust to return," or "He is not certain to return," or "He cannot be sure to return" (compare NJPS)] from darkness,
and he himself ^[Emphatic personal pronoun] is destined for _the_ sword.

###### v23
"He is wandering for bread, _saying_, 'Where _is it_?'
He knows that a day of darkness _is_ ready _at hand_. ^[Hebrew "at his hand"; the meaning seems to be, "his ruin is certain"]

###### v24
Anguish and distress terrify him;
they ^[Hebrew "it"] overpower him like a king ready for the battle.

###### v25
Because he stretched out his hand against God,
and he was arrogant to Shaddai;

###### v26
he _stubbornly_ ^[Literally "with neck"] runs against him
_with his thick-bossed shield_. ^[Literally "with the thickness of the boss of his shield"]

###### v27
"Because he has covered his face with his fat
and has gathered fat upon _his_ loins,

###### v28
_he will dwell_ ^[Hebrew "and he will dwell"] _in_ desolate cities,
in houses that they should not inhabit,
which are destined for rubble.

###### v29
He will not become rich, and his wealth will not endure,
and their possessions will not stretch across the earth. ^[See HCSB, ESV; or "will not reach to the earth"; perhaps "his possessions will not go to the underworld"]

###### v30
"He will not escape from darkness;
a flame will dry up his new shoot,
and by the wind of his mouth he shall be removed.

###### v31
Let him not trust in emptiness--he will be deceiving himself--
for worthlessness will be his recompense.

###### v32
It will be paid in full _before his time_, ^[Literally "in not his day," or "without his day"]
and his branch will not flourish.

###### v33
"He will shake off his unripe fruit like the vine,
and he will cast off his blossom like the olive tree;

###### v34
for _the_ company of _the_ godless _is_ barren,
and fire consumes the tents of those who accept bribes.

###### v35
_They_ conceive trouble and bring forth mischief,
and their womb prepares deceit."
