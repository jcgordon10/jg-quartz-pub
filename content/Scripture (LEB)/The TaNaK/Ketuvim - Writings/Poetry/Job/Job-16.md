###### v1
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Job answered and said,

###### v2
"I have heard many _things_ like these;
all of you _are_ _miserable comforters_. ^[Literally "comforters of trouble"]

###### v3
_Is there_ a limit to windy words?
What provokes you that you answer?

###### v4
I myself ^[Emphatic personal pronoun;] also could talk as you,
if _you were in my place_; ^[Literally "there is your soul in place of my soul"]
I could join against you with words,
and I could shake at you with my head.

###### v5
I could ^[Or "would"] encourage you with my mouth,
and the solace of my lips would ^[Or "should"] ease the pain.

###### v6
If I speak, my pain is not relieved;
and _if_ I cease, how much will leave me?

###### v7
"Surely now he has worn me out;
you ^[Singular] have devastated all my company.

###### v8
Thus ^[Hebrew "And"] you shriveled me up; ^[Or "you have seized me"]
it became a witness.
And my leanness has risen up against me;
it testifies to my face.

###### v9
His wrath has torn, and he has been hostile toward me;
he gnashed at me with his teeth.
My foe sharpens his eyes against me.

###### v10
They gaped at me with their mouth;
they struck my cheeks with disgrace;
they have massed themselves together against me.

###### v11
God delivers me to an evil one,
and he casts me into the hands of _the_ wicked.

###### v12
"I was at ease, then ^[Hebrew "and"] he broke me in two,
and he seized _me_ by my neck;
then ^[Hebrew "and"] he shattered me
and set me up as a target for him.

###### v13
His archers surround me;
he slashes open my kidneys, and he does not have compassion;
he pours out my gall on the ground.

###### v14
He breached me _breach upon breach_; ^[Literally "breach upon _the_ faces of breach"]
he rushes at me like a warrior.

###### v15
"I have sewed sackcloth on my skin,
and I have inserted _my pride_ ^[Literally "my horn"] in the dust.

###### v16
My face is red because of weeping,
and deep shadows _are_ on my eyelids,

###### v17
_although_ ^[Literally "upon," or "because"] violence _is_ not on my hands,
and my prayer _is_ pure.

###### v18
"O earth, you should not cover my blood,
and let there be no place ^[Or "do not let it become a place"] for my cry for help.

###### v19
So now look, my witness _is_ in the heavens,
and he _who_ vouches for me _is_ in the heights.

###### v20
My friends scorn me;
my eye pours out tears to God,

###### v21
and it argues ^[Or "but may _someone_ argue"] for a mortal with God,
and _as_ _a human_ ^[Literally "a son of man"] for his friend.

###### v22
Indeed, _after_ _a few years_ ^[Literally "years of number"] have come,
then ^[Hebrew "and"] I will go _the_ way _from which_ I will not return.
