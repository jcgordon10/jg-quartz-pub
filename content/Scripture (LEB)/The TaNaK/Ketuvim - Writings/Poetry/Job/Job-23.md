###### v1
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Job answered and said,

###### v2
"Even today my complaint _is_ bitter;
my hand is heavy in addition to my groaning.

###### v3
_O that_ ^[Literally "Who shall give"] I knew and _that_ I might find him;
_O that_ I might come to his dwelling.

###### v4
I would lay _my_ case _before him_, ^[Literally "to his face"]
and I would fill my mouth _with_ arguments.

###### v5
I want to know _the_ words _with which_ he would answer me,
and I want to understand what he would say to me.

###### v6
Would he contend with me in _the_ greatness of _his_ strength?
No, but he himself ^[Emphatic personal pronoun] would give heed to me.

###### v7
There an upright person could reason with him,
and I would be acquitted forever by my judge.

###### v8
"When I go forward, _he is not there_, ^[Literally "and there is not he," or "and he is not"]
or ^[Hebrew "and"] backward, I cannot see him. ^[Hebrew "and I cannot see him"]

###### v9
_When he works_ ^[Literally "At his working"] _on the_ left, _I cannot perceive_ ^[Literally "and I cannot see"] _him_;
he turns to _the_ right, but ^[Hebrew "and"] I cannot see _him_.

###### v10
But he knows _the way that I take_; ^[Literally "way with me"]
he tests me--I shall come out like gold.

###### v11
My foot has held on to his steps;
I have kept his way, and I have not turned aside.

###### v12
_From_ the commandment of his lips, indeed ^[Hebrew "and"] I have not departed;
I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily food.

###### v13
"But ^[Hebrew "And"] he _is_ _alone_, ^[Literally "as one"] and who can dissuade him?
And _whatever he desires_, ^[Literally "his inner self desires," or "his soul desires"] _indeed_, ^[Hebrew "and"] he does _it_.

###### v14
For he will carry out _what he appoints for me_, ^[Literally "my portion," or "my allotment"]
and many _things_ like these _are_ with him.

###### v15
Therefore, I am horrified because of his presence;
_when_ I consider, I tremble ^[Hebrew "and I tremble," or "then I tremble"] because of him.

###### v16
Indeed, ^[Hebrew "And"] God has made my heart faint,
and Shaddai has terrified me.

###### v17
Indeed, I have not been silenced _because of darkness_, ^[Literally "from the face of darkness"]
and because of me he ^[Or "it"] conceals thick darkness.
