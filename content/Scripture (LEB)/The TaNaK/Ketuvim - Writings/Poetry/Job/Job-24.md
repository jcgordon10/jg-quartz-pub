###### v1
"Why are not times kept by Shaddai,
and _why_ do not _those who_ know him see his days?

###### v2
They ^[Or "Some" (NASU, ESV) or "Men" (NIV, NET)] remove border _stones_;
they seize flocks, and they pasture _them_.

###### v3
They drive away _the_ donkey of orphans;
they take _the_ widow's ox as a pledge.

###### v4
They thrust _the_ poor off the road;
_the_ needy of _the_ earth hide themselves together. ^[Or "altogether"]

###### v5
"Look, _like_ wild donkeys in the desert
they ^[That is, the poor] go out to their labor _as_ searchers for the prey;
_the_ wilderness _is_ ^[Or "provides"] _their_ ^[Hebrew "for their"] food for the young.

###### v6
They reap their ^[Hebrew "his"] fodder in the field,
and they glean _in the_ vineyard of _the_ wicked.

###### v7
They spend the night naked, _without_ ^[Literally "from not"] clothing,
and _they_ have no garment in the cold.

###### v8
They are wet from the rainstorm of the mountains, ^[Or "from the mountain rainstorm"]
and they cling to the rock _without_ ^[Literally "from not"] refuge.

###### v9
"They ^[That is, those who oppress the poor] snatch _the_ orphan from _the_ breast,
and they take a pledge against _the_ needy. ^[Or "And they take _the_ child of _the_ needy as a pledge"]

###### v10
They ^[That is, the poor] go about naked, without clothing,
and hungry, they carry _the_ sheaves. ^[Or "and they carry _the_ sheaves _though_ hungry"]

###### v11
Between their terraces they press out oil;
they tread _the_ presses, but ^[Hebrew "and"] they are thirsty.

###### v12
From _the_ city people groan,
and _the_ throat ^[Or "soul," or "inner self"] of _the_ wounded cries for help;
yet ^[Hebrew "and"] God does not _regard it as unseemly_. ^[Literally "he puts offensiveness"]

###### v13
"Those are among _the ones_ rebelling _against the_ light;
they do not recognize his ways,
and they do not stay in his paths.

###### v14
_At dusk_ ^[Literally "At the light"] the murderer rises;
he kills _the_ needy and _the_ poor,
and in the night he is like a ^[Or "the"] thief.

###### v15
And _the_ eye of _the_ adulterer waits for dusk,
saying, _'No eye will see me,'_ ^[Literally "'An eye will not see me'"]
and he places a covering _on his_ face.

###### v16
He digs through houses in the darkness;
by day they shut themselves in--
they do not know _the_ light

###### v17
because morning likewise is to them deep darkness;
indeed, they know about _the_ terrors of deep darkness.

###### v18
"He himself ^[Emphatic personal pronoun] _is_ swift on _the_ water's surface;
their portion is cursed in the land.
_No one turns toward the path of their vineyards_. ^[Literally "He does not turn toward _the_ path of _the_ vineyard"]

###### v19
Drought and heat snatch away _the_ snow waters,
_like_ Sheol _snatches away_ those ^[Or "they/them"] _who have_ sinned.

###### v20
_The_ womb forgets him.
_The_ maggot feasts on him _until_ he is no longer remembered,
and wickedness is broken like a ^[Or "the"] tree.

###### v21
_He_ feeds on _the_ barren, _who_ does not have a child,
and does no good to _the_ widow.

###### v22
Yet ^[Hebrew "And"] he ^[The probable antecedent is God] carries off _the_ tyrants by his strength;
_if_ he rises up, then ^[Hebrew "and"] he ^[The antecedent of the singular here probably changes to the wicked person] cannot be certain of life. ^[Hebrew "the life"]

###### v23
He ^[The probable antecedent is God] gives security to him, and he is ^[Or "they are"] supported,
but ^[Hebrew "and"] his eyes _are_ upon their ways.

###### v24
They are exalted a little while, then ^[Literally "and"] _they are gone_. ^[Literally "he is not"]
And they are brought low; they are cut off like all _others_,
and like _the_ heads of grain they wither away.

###### v25
"And if _it is_ not _so_, then who can prove me a liar
and reduce my word to nothing?"
