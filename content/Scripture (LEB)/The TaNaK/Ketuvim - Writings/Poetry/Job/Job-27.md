and the spirit of God _is_ in my nose,

###### v5

I hold fast to my righteousness, and I will not let it go;
my heart will not blame _any_ of my days.

###### v7

"I will teach you ^[Plural] about ^[Or "concerning"] God's hand;
I will not conceal that _which is_ with Shaddai.

Look, you all have seen,
and _why in the world_ ^[Literally "why this"] _have you become altogether vain_? ^[Literally "vain you have become vain"]

###### v13
"This _is the_ portion of _the_ wicked human being with God,
and they receive from Shaddai _the_ inheritance of _the_ ruthless.

If their children multiply, _it is_ for _the_ sword,
and his offspring _do not have enough to eat_. ^[Literally "they are not satisfied with bread"]

Their ^[Hebrew "His"] survivors are buried through ^[Or "because of"] the plague,
and their ^[Hebrew "his"] widows do not weep.

###### v16
If he heaps up silver like the dust
and fashions clothing like the clay,

###### v17
he makes _it_ ready, and _the_ righteous will wear _it_,
and _the_ innocent will divide _the_ silver.

###### v18
"He builds his house like the moth,
and like a booth _that_ a watchman has made.

###### v19
He goes to bed _with_ wealth, but ^[Hebrew "and"] _he will do so no more_; ^[Literally "he will not do again"]
he opens his eyes, and _it is gone_. ^[Literally "it is not"]

###### v20
Terrors overtake him like the water;
a storm wind carries him off _in the_ night.

###### v21
_The_ east wind lifts him up, and he is gone,
and it sweeps him away from his place.

###### v22
And it hurls at him, and it has no compassion;
he will quickly flee from its power.

###### v23
It claps its hands over him,
and it hisses at him from its place.
