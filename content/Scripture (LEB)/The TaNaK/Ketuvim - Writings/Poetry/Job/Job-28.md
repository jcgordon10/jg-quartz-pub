###### v3
He puts an end to darkness,
and he searches out the farthest limits
_for the_ ore _in_ gloom and deep shadow.

###### v4

_those_ who are forgotten _by travelers_, ^[Literally "by feet"]
they dangle, they sway _far away_ from human beings.

_As for the_ earth, from it comes food, ^[Or "bread"]

###### v7
"_It is_ a path a bird of prey does not know
and _the_ black kite's eye has not seen.

###### v8

_the_ lion in its prime has not prowled over it.

he overturns mountains by _the_ roots.

###### v14
The deep says, 'It _is_ not in me,'

###### v15
"Refined gold cannot be gotten in its place,
and silver cannot be weighed out _as_ its price.

###### v16
It cannot be bought for the gold of Ophir,

###### v17
Gold and glass cannot be compared with it,
and its substitution _cannot be_ an ornament of refined gold.

###### v18
Black corals and crystal will not be mentioned,
and wisdom's price _is_ more than red corals.

###### v19
The topaz of Cush cannot be compared with it;
it cannot be bought for pure gold.

###### v20
Indeed, ^[Hebrew "And"] from where does wisdom come?
And _where in the world_ ^[Literally "where this"] _is the_ place of understanding?

###### v21

Abaddon and Death say,
'We heard its rumor with our ears.'

###### v23

for he himself ^[Emphatic personal pronoun] looks to _the_ end of the earth;
he sees under all the heaven.

###### v26
_when he made_ ^[Literally "at his making"] a rule for the rain

he established it, and moreover, he explored it.

###### v28
And to the human beings he said,
'Look, the fear of the Lord _is_ wisdom,
and to depart from evil _is_ understanding.'"
