###### v1
"But now _those_ younger than I, as far as days, laugh at me,
whose fathers I rejected for setting with the dogs of my sheep and goats.

###### v2
Moreover, _what use to me is the strength of their hands_? ^[Literally "the strength of their hands what _is_ for me"]
With them, vigor is destroyed.

###### v3
Through want and through barren hunger
they are gnawing _in the_ dry region _in the_ darkness of desolation and waste.

###### v4
They are picking salt herbs, the leaves of bushes,
and _the_ roots of broom trees to warm themselves.

###### v5
They were driven out from fellow people;
they shout at them as _at_ a ^[Hebrew "the"] thief,

###### v6
_so that they dwell_ ^[Literally "to dwell"]
_in_ holes of _the_ ground and _in the_ rocks.

###### v7
They bray among _the_ bushes;
they are gathered under _the_ nettles.

###### v8
_A senseless crowd_, ^[Literally "sons of good-for-nothing"] yes, _a disreputable brood_, ^[Literally "sons of no name"]
they were cast out from the land.

###### v9
"But now I am their mocking song,
and I have become a byword for them.

###### v10
They abhor me; they keep aloof from me,
and they do not withhold spit from my face

###### v11
because he has loosened his bowstring and humbled me,
and they have thrown off restraint _in my presence_. ^[Literally "from my face"]

###### v12
On _the_ right hand the brood rises ^[Hebrew "rise"] up;
_they put me to flight_, ^[Literally "my feet they send away"]
and they build up their _siege ramps_ ^[Literally "the ways/paths of their disaster"] against me.

###### v13
They destroy my path;
they promote my destruction;
they have no helper.

###### v14
As _through_ a wide breach they come;
amid a crash they rush on.

###### v15
Terrors are turned upon me;
my honor is pursued as _by_ the wind,
and my hope of deliverance passed by like a cloud.

###### v16
"And now my life is poured out onto me;
days of misery have taken hold of me.

###### v17
_At night I am in great pain_; ^[Literally "night my bones he pierces upon me," or "night pierces my bones upon me"]
my pains do not take a rest.

###### v18
He seizes my clothing with _great power_; ^[Literally "much of strength"]
he grasps me by my tunic's collar.

###### v19
He has cast me into the dirt,
and I have become like dust ^[Hebrew "the dust"] and ashes.

###### v20
I cry to you for help, but ^[Hebrew "and"] you do not answer me;
I stand, and you _merely_ look at me.

###### v21
You have turned cruel to me;
you persecute me with your hand's might.

###### v22
You lift me up to _the_ wind--you make me ride _it_,
and you toss me about _in_ the storm.

###### v23
Indeed, I know _that_ you will bring me to death
and _to the_ house of assembly for all _the_ living.

###### v24
"Surely someone must not send a hand against _the_ needy
when, in his misfortune, _there is_ a cry of help for them.

###### v25
Have I not wept for _the unfortunate_, ^[Literally "hard of day"]
_and_ grieved myself over the poor?

###### v26
Indeed, I hoped for good, but evil came,
and I waited for light, but darkness came.

###### v27
My bowels are in turmoil, and they are not still;
days of misery come to confront me.

###### v28
I go _about_ in mourning garb, _but_ not in sunlight;
I stand up in the assembly, _and_ I cry for help.

###### v29
I am a companion for _the_ jackals
and a companion for _ostriches_. ^[Literally "daughters of ostrich"]

###### v30
My skin turns black on me,
and my bones burn with heat.

###### v31
So ^[Hebrew "And"] my lyre came to be _used_ for mourning,
and my flute _for the_ voice of _those who_ weep.
