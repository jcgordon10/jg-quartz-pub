"I made a covenant with my eyes,
so ^[Hebrew "and"] how could I look closely upon a virgin?

###### v2
And what _is_ the portion of God from above
or ^[Hebrew "and"] the heritage of Shaddai from on high?

###### v3
Is not disaster for _the_ evil one
and ruin for _the_ workers of mischief?

###### v4
Does he not see my ways
and count all my steps?

###### v5
"If I have walked with falseness,
and my foot has hastened to deceit,

###### v6
let him weigh me in _the_ balance of justice,
and let God know my blamelessness.

###### v7
If my steps have turned aside from the way,
and my heart has walked after my eyes,
and my hand has clung to a spot,

###### v8
let me sow, and let another eat,
and let my crops be rooted out.

###### v9
"If my heart has been enticed by a woman,
and at my neighbor's doorway I have lain in wait,

###### v10
let my wife grind for another,
and let other _men_ kneel over her,

###### v11
for that _is_ a shameful act,
and that _is_ _a criminal offense_. ^[Literally "an iniquity of judges"]

###### v12
Indeed, that _is_ a fire that will consume up to Abaddon,
and it would uproot all my crop.

###### v13
"If I have rejected my male or ^[Hebrew "and"] female slave's case
when their complaint _was_ against me,

###### v14
then ^[Hebrew "and"] what shall I do when God rises up?
And when he enquires, how shall I answer him?

###### v15
Did not he _who_ made me in the womb make them?
And did not one fashion us in the womb?

###### v16
"If I have withheld _the_ desire of _the_ poor from _them_,
or ^[Hebrew "and"] I have caused _the_ widow's eyes to fail,

###### v17
or I have eaten my morsel _alone_, ^[Literally "to alone me"]
and _the_ orphan has not eaten from it

###### v18
(for from my childhood he ^[Probably referring to "the orphan"] _grew up with_ ^[Literally "reared"] me like a father,
and from my mother's womb I guided her ^[Probably referring to "the widow"]),

###### v19
if I have seen _the one who_ perishes because of no clothing
or ^[Hebrew "and"] _that_ there is no covering for the poor,

###### v20
if his loins have not blessed me,
or ^[Hebrew "and"] by means of my sheep's fleece he has warmed himself,

###### v21
if I have raised my hand against an orphan
because I saw my supporters at the gate,

###### v22
_then_ let my shoulder blade fall from _my_ shoulder,
and let my arm be broken from its socket.

###### v23
Indeed, the disaster from God _was_ a dread for me,
and _I was powerless_ ^[Literally "I was not able"] because of his majesty.

###### v24
"If I have made gold my trust,
or ^[Hebrew "and"] I have called fine gold my security,

###### v25
if I have rejoiced because my wealth _was_ great
or ^[Hebrew "and"] because my hand found a fortune,

###### v26
if I looked at _the_ sun when it shone
or ^[Hebrew "and"] _at the_ moon moving _in_ splendor,

###### v27
and _I was secretly enticed_, ^[Literally "it was gullible in the secrecy of my heart"]
and _my hand threw them a kiss_, ^[Literally "my hand kissed for my mouth"]

###### v28
this also _is_ an iniquity _to be_ judged,
for I have deceived God above.

###### v29
"If I have rejoiced at _the_ ruin of _the one who_ hated me
or ^[Hebrew "and"] have exulted when evil overtook him--

###### v30
no, ^[Hebrew "and"] I have not allowed my mouth to sin,
to ask his life with a curse.

###### v31
_Have the people of my tent not said_, ^[Literally "If the people of my tent have not said"]
'_O that_ ^[Literally "who shall give"] someone ^[Or "he"] had not been satisfied with his meat'?

###### v32
An alien has not lodged in the street;
I have opened my door to the traveler.

###### v33
_Have I concealed_ ^[Literally "If I have concealed"] my transgressions as _other_ human beings
to hide my iniquity in my bosom

###### v34
because I dreaded _the_ great multitude,
and _the_ contempt of clans terrified me,
so that I kept quiet, I did not go out of _the_ doorway?

###### v35
_O that_ ^[Literally "Who shall give"] _I had_ ^[Literally "for me"] someone hearing me!
Here is my signature;
let Shaddai answer me!
_As for_ ^[Hebrew "And," or "But"] _the_ written communication _that_ _my adversary_ ^[Literally "the man of my indictment"] has written,

###### v36
I would _surely_ ^[Literally "if not"] carry it on my shoulder;
I would bind it on me _like_ a crown.

###### v37
I would give him an account of my steps;
I would approach him like a noble.

###### v38
If my land has cried out against me,
and its furrows have wept together,

###### v39
if I have eaten its yield without payment,
or ^[Hebrew "and"] I have caused _the_ breath of its owners to die,

###### v40
let thorns grow in place of wheat
and noxious weeds in place of barley."
The words of Job are ended.
