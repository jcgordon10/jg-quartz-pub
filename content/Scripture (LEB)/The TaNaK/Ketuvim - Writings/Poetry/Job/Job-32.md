###### v1
Then these three men ceased from answering Job because he _was_ righteous in his _own_ eyes.

###### v2
So Elihu the son of Barakel the Buzite, from the clan of Ram, _became angry_. ^[Literally "the nose of Elihu became hot"] _He became angry_ ^[Literally "His nose became hot"] at Job because he justified himself rather than God,

###### v3
and _he became angry_ ^[Literally "his nose became hot"] at his three friends because they had not found an answer, and they had declared Job guilty.

###### v4
Thus Elihu had waited for Job _to speak_ ^[Literally "in words"] because _they were older than he_. ^[Literally "they _were_ older than he as far as days"]

###### v5
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, _he became angry_. ^[Literally "his nose became hot"]

###### v6
Then Elihu the son of Barakel the Buzite _spoke up_ ^[Literally "answered"; see NET] and said,
"_I am young_, ^[Literally "Young I _am_ as far as days"] but ^[Or "and"] you ^[Plural] are old;
therefore I feared and became afraid of explaining my knowledge to you. ^[Plural]

###### v7
I thought, ^[Or "said"] 'Let days ^[Compare the idiom of "as far as days" in vv. [[Job-32#v4|4]] and 6] speak,
and let many years teach wisdom.'

###### v8
"Truly, it _is_ a spirit in a human being,
and the breath of Shaddai teaches them.

###### v9
_It is_ not _the aged_ ^[Literally "many _in days_"] _who_ are wise,
or ^[Hebrew "and"] _it is not_ _the_ elders _who_ understand justice.

###### v10
Therefore I say, 'Listen to me;
let me also declare my knowledge myself.'

###### v11
"Look, I waited for your ^[Plural] words;
I listened for your ^[Plural] insight,
until you searched out _what to say_. ^[Literally "words," or "sentences"]

###### v12
And I directed my attention to you; ^[Plural]
and, look, there is no _one_ for Job _who_ refuted,
answering his words among you.

###### v13
So do not say, 'We have found wisdom;
let God refute him, not a man.'

###### v14
But ^[Hebrew "And"] he did not direct _his_ words ^[Or "sentences," or "what he said"] to me,
and I will not answer him with your ^[Plural] words.

###### v15
"They are dismayed; they no longer answer;
_they have nothing to say_. ^[Literally "words fail from them," or "sentences fail from them," or "what to say fails from them"]

###### v16
And I have waited because they do not speak,
because they stand _there_ _and_ no longer answer.

###### v17
I myself will answer my share also;
I myself will declare my knowledge also,

###### v18
for I am full of words; ^[Or "sentences," or "what to say"]
_the spirit within me_ ^[Literally "the spirit of my stomach"] urges me.

###### v19
"Look, my internal organs _are_ like unopened wine,
like new wineskins it ^[Antecedent is "wine"] is _ready_ to burst open.

###### v20
Let me speak _that I may find relief_; ^[Literally "and let it find relief for me"]
let me open my lips, and let me answer.

###### v21
_Please let me not show partiality to anyone_, ^[Literally "Not please I will lift up face of a man"]
and let me not show flattery to human beings,

###### v22
for I do not know _how_ _to flatter_, ^[Literally "I will flatter"]
_else_ my Maker would _soon_ ^[Literally "like little"] put an end to me.
