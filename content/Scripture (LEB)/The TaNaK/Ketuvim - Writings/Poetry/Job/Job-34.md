###### v1
Thus ^[Hebrew "And"] Elihu _spoke up_ ^[Literally "answered"; see NET] and said,

###### v2
"Hear my words, you wise men,
and listen to me, you who know,

###### v3
for _the_ ear tests words,
and _the_ palate tastes _food_. ^[Literally "to eat"]

###### v4
Let us choose justice for ourselves;
let us determine among ourselves what _is_ good--

###### v5
for Job has said, 'I am righteous,
but God has taken away my justice.

###### v6
Should I lie concerning my justice?
_Though I am_ without transgression, my wound caused by an arrow is incurable.'

###### v7
What man _is_ like Job,
who drinks scorn like water?

###### v8
And he goes on the road in company with instigators of mischief,
and walks with men of wickedness.

###### v9
Indeed, he says, 'A man does not profit
when he takes delight in God.'

###### v10
"Therefore, listen to me, _people who have sense_: ^[Literally "men of heart"]
far be it from God _that he should commit wickedness_ ^[Literally "from wickedness"]
and that Shaddai _should do wrong_. ^[Literally "from wrong"]

###### v11
Indeed, he will repay _according to_ a human being's deeds,
and according to a man's way he will let _it_ happen _to_ him.

###### v12
What's more, God truly does not act wickedly,
and Shaddai does not pervert justice.

###### v13
Who gave him charge _over the_ earth?
Or ^[Hebrew "And"] who laid on _him_ _the_ whole world?

###### v14
If he should set his heart to it,
and he should gather his spirit and his breath to himself,

###### v15
all flesh would perish together,
and humankind would return to dust.

###### v16
"But ^[Hebrew "And"] if _you have_ understanding, hear this;
listen to _what I say_. ^[Literally "the voice/sound of my words"]

###### v17
Shall _he who_ hates justice really govern?
Or will you ^[Singular] declare _the_ Righteous One, the Mighty, guilty?--

###### v18
the one who says to a king,
'You worthless man,' to noblemen, 'You wicked man,'

###### v19
who _shows no partiality to officials_ ^[Literally "he does not lift the face of officials"]
and _who_ _does not take note of the noble more than of the insignificant_, ^[Literally "he does not regard _the_ eminent to the face of _the_ poor/insignificant"]
for all of them _are_ the work of his hands?

###### v20
_In_ a moment they die,
and _in_ the middle of _the_ night _the_ people are shaken, and they pass away,
and they take away _the_ mighty _effortlessly_. ^[Literally "not by a hand"]

###### v21
"Indeed, his eyes _are_ upon _the_ ways of man,
and he sees all his steps.

###### v22
There is no darkness, and there is no deep shadow
where instigators of mischief might hide themselves.

###### v23
Indeed, he has not yet appointed _a time_ for man
to go to God in the judgment.

###### v24
He shatters the mighty without investigation,
and he sets others in their place.

###### v25
Therefore he knows their works,
and he overturns _them_ _in the_ night
_so that_ ^[Hebrew "and"] they are crushed.

###### v26
He strikes them _where the wicked stood_, ^[Literally "among _the_ wicked"]
_where there are onlookers_, ^[Literally "in _the_ place of seers"]

###### v27
because they have turned aside from him
and have not understood any of his ways,

###### v28
so that _they_ cause _the_ cry of distress from _the_ helpless to come to him,
and he hears _the_ cry of distress from _the_ needy,

###### v29
but he remains quiet, and who can condemn?
And he hides _his_ face, and who can behold him?
Yet ^[Hebrew "And"] _he is_ over a nation and over a person alike,

###### v30
so that godless human beings should not reign,
nor those who ensnare _the_ people.

###### v31
"Indeed, does anyone say to God, 'I have endured _chastisement_;
I will not act corruptly _again_;

###### v32
teach me yourself _what I cannot see_; ^[Literally "apart from _what_ I can see"]
if I have done wrong, I will not repeat _it_'?

###### v33
_According to your judgment_, ^[Literally "from with you"] must he repay _it_ because you rejected _this_?
Indeed, you must choose, and not I, so ^[Hebrew "And"] declare what you know.

###### v34
_Those who have sense_ ^[Literally "Men of heart"] say to me,
and _the_ wise man hearing me _says_:

###### v35
'Job speaks without knowledge,
and his words _are_ without insight.

###### v36
Would that Job were tested up to _the_ end
because _his_ answers _are_ like _those from_ men of mischief,

###### v37
for he adds transgression to his sin;
he claps hands among us,
and he multiplies his words against God.'"
