###### v1
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Elihu continued and said,

###### v2
"Bear with me a little longer, and _I will explain_, ^[Literally "I will show you"]
for _I still have something to say on God's behalf_. ^[Literally "yet on behalf of God words/sentences"]

###### v3
I will bring my knowledge from far away,
and I will ascribe righteousness to my maker,

###### v4
for truly my words ^[Or "what I have to say"] _are_ not falsehood;
_one who has_ perfect knowledge _is_ with you. ^[In other words, "Somebody who knows what he is talking about is addressing you"]

###### v5
Look, God _is_ mighty but ^[Hebrew "and"] does not despise _anyone_;
_he is_ mighty _and_ _good in understanding_. ^[Literally "strength of heart"]

###### v6
He does not keep _the_ wicked alive
but ^[Hebrew "and"] grants justice _to the_ afflicted.

###### v7
He does not withdraw his eyes from _the_ righteous,
but ^[Hebrew "and"] he sets them forever with kings on the throne, and they are exalted.

###### v8
"And if _they_ are tied up with fetters,
_if_ they are caught in _the_ cords of misery,

###### v9
then ^[Hebrew "and"] he declares their work to them,
and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly.

###### v10
So ^[Hebrew "And"] he opens their ear to the discipline,
and he commands that they return from mischief.

###### v11
If they listen and serve _him_,
they complete their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness.

###### v12
But ^[Hebrew "And"] if they do not listen, they perish by _the_ sword,
and they pass away without knowledge.

###### v13
And _the_ godless of heart cherish anger;
they do not cry for help when he binds them.

###### v14
_They die in their youth_, ^[Literally "It dies in the youth of their self"]
and their life _ends_ among the male shrine prostitutes.

###### v15
He delivers _the_ afflicted by his misery,
and he opens their ears by the adversity.

###### v16
And what's more, he allured you _out of distress_ ^[Literally "from _the_ mouth of distress"]
_into_ a broad place, _where_ in place of it _was_ no constraint;
and _what_ was set on your table is full of fatness.

###### v17
But ^[Hebrew "And"] you are obsessed with _the_ judgment of _the_ wicked;
judgment and justice take hold of you.

###### v18
Yes, ^[Or "Indeed"] _it is_ wrath, so that it will not incite you into mockery;
and do not let _the_ ransom's greatness turn you aside.

###### v19
Will your cry for help sustain _you_ without distress,
or ^[Hebrew "and"] all _the_ efforts of _your_ strength?

###### v20
You must not long for the night,
to cut off people _in their place_. ^[Literally "in place of them"]

###### v21
Take care, you must not turn to mischief,
for because of this you have been tried by misery.

###### v22
"Look, God is exalted in his power;
who _is_ a teacher like him?

###### v23
Who has prescribed his way for him?
Or ^[Hebrew "And"] who says, 'You have done wrong'?

###### v24
Remember that you should extol his work,
_of_ which people have sung.

###### v25
All human beings have looked on it;
everyone watches from afar.

###### v26
"Look, God _is_ exalted, and we do not know _him_;
the number of his years is unsearchable.

###### v27
Indeed, he draws up _the_ drops of water;
he distills _the_ rain into its mist,

###### v28
which _the_ clouds pour down;
they shower abundantly on human beings.

###### v29
"Moreover, _can anyone understand_ ^[Literally "if he can understand"] _the_ spreading of clouds,
_the_ thundering of his dwelling place?

###### v30
Look, he scatters his lightning around him,
and he covers the roots of the sea.

###### v31
Indeed, he judges people by them;
he gives food _in abundance_. ^[Literally "as far as providing in abundance"]

###### v32
He covers _his_ hands _with_ lightning,
and he commands it the place at _which_ to strike.

###### v33
His thundering tells about him;
_the_ livestock also _tell_ _concerning what rises_. ^[Literally "about going up"]
