###### v14
Indeed, it leaves its eggs to the earth,
and it lets _them_ be warmed on _the_ ground,

###### v15
and it forgets that a foot might crush an egg, ^[Hebrew "it"; or a collective singular ("them") referring to "eggs" in v. [[Job-39#v14|14]]]

###### v16
It deals cruelly with its young ones, as _if_ _they were_ not its _own_,

and it cannot stand still at _the_ sound of _the_ horn.

And it smells _the_ battle from a distance--
_the_ thunder of _the_ commanders and _the_ war cry.
