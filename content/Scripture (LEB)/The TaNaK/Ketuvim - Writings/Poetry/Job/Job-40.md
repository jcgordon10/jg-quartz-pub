###### v1
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Yahweh answered Job and said,

###### v2
"Shall a faultfinder contend with Shaddai?
Anyone who argues with God must answer it."

###### v3
So Job answered Yahweh and said,

###### v4
"Look, I am insignificant.
What shall I answer you?
I lay my hand on my mouth.

###### v5
Once I have spoken, and I will not answer;
even ^[Hebrew "And"] twice, but ^[Or "and"] I will not proceed."

###### v6
Then ^[Or "And"] Yahweh answered Job from the storm, and he said,

###### v7
"_Prepare yourself for a difficult task like a man_, ^[Literally "Gird up like a man your loins"]
and I will question you, and you shall declare to me.

###### v8
"Indeed, would you annul my justice?
Would you condemn me, so that you might be righteous?

###### v9
Or do you have an arm like God,
and can you thunder with a voice like his?

###### v10
Adorn ^[The particle sometimes translated "please" is present, but an almighty God or sovereign king does not say "please" when commanding his subjects] yourself _with_ pride and dignity,
and clothe yourself _with_ splendor.

###### v11
Pour out the overflowing of your anger,
and look at all _the_ proud, and humble them.

###### v12
Look at all _the_ proud, humble them,
and tread down _the_ wicked _where they stand_. ^[Literally "in place of them"]

###### v13
Hide them in the dust together;
bind their faces in the grave.

###### v14
And I will also praise you,
that your _own_ right hand can save you.

###### v15
"Look, Behemoth, ^[Some interpret as a hippopotamus] which I have made just as _I made_ you;
it eats grass like the ox.

###### v16
Look, its strength _is_ in its loins
and its power in the muscles of its stomach.

###### v17
It keeps its tail straight like a cedar;
_the_ sinews of its thighs are tightly wound.

###### v18
Its bones _are_ tubes of copper,
its limbs like rods of iron.

###### v19
"It _is_ the first of God's actions;
the _one who_ made him furnishes _it with_ his sword. ^[See NET; nearly all other English translations: "Only his Maker can draw the sword against him" (NJPS; compare NLT), or "only its Maker can approach it with the sword" (NRSV, NIV, ESV, HCSB, NASU)]

###### v20
Yes, _the_ mountains yield produce for it,
and all _wild animals_ ^[Literally "all _the_ animals of the field"] play there.

###### v21
Under _the_ lotus tree it lies,
in _the_ hiding place of _the_ reeds and _in the_ marsh.

###### v22
_The_ lotus trees cover it _with_ their shade;
_the_ wadi's ^[A seasonal stream that is often dry] poplar trees surround it.

###### v23
Look, _if the_ river is turbulent, it is not frightened;
it is confident even though _the_ Jordan rushes against its mouth.

###### v24
Can anyone take it by its eyes?
Can he pierce _its_ nose with a snare?
