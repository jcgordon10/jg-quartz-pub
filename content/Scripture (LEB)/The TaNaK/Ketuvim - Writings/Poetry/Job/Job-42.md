[[Job-41|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Job answered Yahweh and said,

###### v2
"I know that you can do all _things_,
and _any_ scheme from you will not be thwarted.

###### v3
'Who _is_ this darkening counsel without knowledge?'
Therefore I uttered, but ^[Hebrew "and"] I did not understand;
_things too wonderful for me_, ^[Literally "wonderful things from me"] but I did not know.

###### v4
'Hear and I will speak;
I will question you, then ^[Hebrew "and"] inform me.'

###### v5
By the ear's hearing I heard _of_ you,
but ^[Hebrew "and"] now my eye has seen you.

###### v6
Therefore I despise _myself_
and repent in dust and ashes."

###### v7
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it happened"] after Yahweh spoke these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "_My wrath has been kindled_ ^[Literally "My nose became hot"] against you ^[Singular] and against _the_ two of your friends, for you ^[Plural] have not spoken to me what is right as my servant Job _has_.

###### v8
_So then_, ^[Or "And now," or "Therefore"] take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job will pray for you, ^[Plural] for _I will certainly accept his prayer_, ^[Literally "if his face I will lift up," or "indeed his face I will lift up" ("if" used as an oath particle)] so that it will not be done with you ^[Plural] _according to your_ folly, for you ^[Plural] have not spoken to me what is right as my servant Job _has_."

###### v9
So ^[Hebrew "And"] Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite _and_ Zophar the Naamathite went and did just as Yahweh had told them, and _Yahweh accepted Job's prayer_. ^[Literally "Yahweh lifted up the face of Job"]

###### v10
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Yahweh returned Job's fortune when he prayed to him on behalf of his friends. Thus ^[Hebrew "And"] Yahweh increased _all that Job had twice as much as before_. ^[Literally "all which for Job to twice"]

###### v11
So ^[Hebrew "And"] all his brothers and all his sisters and all _those who_ had known him _before_ ^[Literally "to faces"] came to him, and they ate bread ^[Or "food"] with him in his house and showed sympathy to him and comforted him for all the disaster ^[Or "evil"] that Yahweh had brought upon him. Then ^[Hebrew "And"] each one gave to him one piece of money, and each one _gave to him_ one ornamental ring of gold.

###### v12
So ^[Hebrew "And"] Yahweh blessed Job's latter days more than his beginning. _Thus he had_ ^[Literally "And it came to be for him," or "And it was for him"] fourteen thousand sheep and goats and six thousand camels and a thousand pair of oxen and a thousand female donkeys.

###### v13
_And he had_ ^[Literally "And it came to be for him," or "And it was for him"] seven sons and three daughters.

###### v14
And he called the name of the first Jemimah and the name of the second Keziah and the name of the third Qeren-Happuk.

###### v15
And beautiful women were not found in all the land like Job's daughters, and their father gave to them an inheritance in the midst of their brothers.

###### v16
And Job lived after this one hundred and forty years, and he saw his sons and his _grandsons_ ^[Literally "the sons of his sons"] _for_ four generations.

###### v17
Then ^[Hebrew "And"] Job died old and full of days.
