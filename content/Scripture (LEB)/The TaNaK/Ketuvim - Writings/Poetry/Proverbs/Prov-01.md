[[Prov-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:

###### v2
To know wisdom and instruction,
to understand sayings of understanding,

###### v3
to gain _insightful instruction_, ^[Literally "the instruction of insight"]
righteousness and justice and equity,

###### v4
to give shrewdness ^[Or "cleverness," or "prudence"] to the simple,
knowledge and purpose ^[Or "plan"] to the young,

###### v5
may the wise hear and increase learning,
and the one who understands gain direction, ^[Or "guidance"]

###### v6
to understand a proverb and an expression,
words of wisdom and their riddles.

###### v7
Fear of Yahweh _is the_ beginning of knowledge;
wisdom and instruction, fools despise.

###### v8
My child, may you keep ^[Or "obey," or "hear"] your father's instruction,
and do not reject your mother's teachings,

###### v9
for they _are_ a garland of favor for your head,
and pendants for your neck.

###### v10
My child, if sinners entice you, do not consent.

###### v11
If they say,
"Come with us!
We shall lie in wait for blood;
we shall ambush the innocent without cause. ^[Or "wantonly," or "for nothing"]

###### v12
Like Sheol, ^[A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld] we will swallow them alive
and whole, _like those who descend to the pit_. ^[Literally "like the descenders of a pit"]

###### v13
We shall find all precious wealth,
we shall fill our houses _with_ booty,

###### v14
you shall throw your lot in our midst,
there will be one purse for all of us."

###### v15
My child, do not walk in their way. ^[Or "on their road"]
Keep your foot from their paths,

###### v16
for their feet run to evil,
and they hurry to shed blood,

###### v17
for "in vain ^[Or "without cause," or "for nothing"] is the net scattered,
in the sight of any _winged bird_." ^[Literally "bird of wing"]

###### v18
They lie in wait for their _own_ blood.
They ambush their _own_ lives.

###### v19
Thus are the ways of all who are greedy _for_ gain--
it will take the life of its possessors.

###### v20
Wisdom calls out in the streets,
in the squares she raises her voice.

###### v21
On a _busy corner_ ^[Literally "head of commotion," or "head of stirring, bustling"] she cries out,
at the entrances of the gates in the city, she speaks her sayings:

###### v22
"_How long_, ^[Literally "Until when"] O simple ones, will you love simplicity?
And _how long_ will scoffers delight in their scoffing,
and fools hate knowledge?

###### v23
May you turn to my argument! ^[Or "turn at my reproach"]
Behold, I shall pour out my spirit upon you;
I will make my words known to you.

###### v24
Because I called out and you refused me,
I stretched out my hand, yet there is none who heeds.

###### v25
You have ignored all my counsel,
and my reproof you are not willing _to accept_.

###### v26
I will also laugh at your calamity; ^[Or "downfall"]
I will mock when panic ^[Or "dread, fear"] comes _upon_ you.

###### v27
When your panic comes like a storm,
and your calamity arrives like a whirlwind,
when distress and anguish come upon you,

###### v28
then they will call ^[Or "cry out _to_"] me, but I will not answer;
they will seek me diligently but not find me.

###### v29
Since they hated knowledge,
and did not choose the fear of Yahweh,

###### v30
they were not willing _to accept_ my counsel,
they despised all my reproof.

###### v31
They shall eat from the fruit of their way,
and they shall be sated from their own schemes,

###### v32
for the waywardness of the simple ones will kill them,
and the complacency of fools will destroy them.

###### v33
Whoever listens to me will dwell in security
and rest securely ^[Or "be at ease, peace"] from dread and disaster."
