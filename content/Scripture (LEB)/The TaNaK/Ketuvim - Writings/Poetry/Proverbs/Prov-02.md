###### v1
My child, if you will receive ^[Or "take, seize"] my sayings,
and hide my commands with you,

###### v2
_in order_ to incline your ear toward wisdom,
_then_ you shall apply your heart to understanding.

###### v3
For if you cry out for understanding, ^[Or "call to understanding"]
_if_ you lift ^[Or "carry, give"] your voice for insight,

###### v4
if you seek her like silver
and search her out _like treasure_, ^[Literally "like the treasures"]

###### v5
then you will understand the fear of Yahweh,
and the knowledge of God you will find.

###### v6
For Yahweh will give wisdom;
from his mouth _come_ knowledge and understanding.

###### v7
For the upright, he stores ^[Or "hides, keeps"] sound judgment, a shield for those who walk uprightly,

###### v8
_in order_ to guard paths of justice
and keep ^[Or "preserve, guard, watch"] the way of his faithful _ones_.

###### v9
Then you will understand righteousness and justice
and uprightness--every good course--

###### v10
for wisdom will enter your heart,
and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul. ^[Or "inner self"]

###### v11
Discretion will watch over you;
understanding will protect you,

###### v12
_in order_ to deliver you from the way of evil, ^[Or "evildoer"]
from a man who speaks devious things--

###### v13
those who forsake the paths of uprightness
to walk in ways of darkness,

###### v14
those who are happy to do evil,
_for_ they delight in _the_ deviousness of evil,

###### v15
_who are crooked in their ways_, ^[Literally "that _in_ their ways are crooked"]
and devious in their paths;

###### v16
_in order_ to deliver you from a strange woman,
from a foreign woman _who_ flatters ^[Or "makes smooth"] _with_ her sayings,

###### v17
she who forsakes the partner of her youth
and has forgotten the covenant of her God,

###### v18
for her house sinks to death,
and to the dead ^[Or "Rephaim"] are her paths.

###### v19
_Of_ all who go to her, none shall return,
nor do they reach paths of life.

###### v20
So that you will walk on the road of those who are good,
and the paths of those who are righteous you shall keep.

###### v21
For those who are upright will dwell _in the_ land, ^[Or "earth"]
and those who are blameless ^[Or "innocent"] will remain in it.

###### v22
And those who are wicked will be cut off from the land,
and those who are treacherous will be uprooted from it.
