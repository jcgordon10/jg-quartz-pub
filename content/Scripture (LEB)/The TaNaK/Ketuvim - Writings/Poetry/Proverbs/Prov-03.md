###### v2
For length of days, years of life,
and peace they ^[That is, "my commands" (3:1)] shall add to you.

May loyal love ^[Or "kindness, mercy"] and truth not forsake you;
bind them around your neck,
write them upon your heart.

###### v4
And you shall find favor and good sense ^[Or "understanding, prudence"]
in the eyes of God and humankind.

In all your ways acknowledge him,

Happy _is_ _the one_ ^[Literally "a man"] who finds wisdom,
and one who obtains understanding.

For her ^[Or "its"; both "wisdom" and "understanding" are feminine nouns and can be read as either "she" or "it"] income is better than the income of silver,
and her revenue than _that of_ gold.

###### v15
She is more precious than rubies,
and all your desires shall not compare with her.

###### v16
Length of days _is_ in her right hand;
in her left hand _are_ riches and honor.

Yahweh in wisdom founded the earth;
he established the heavens in understanding.

###### v20
With his knowledge, depths broke open,
and clouds dropped dew.

###### v21
My child, may they ^[Grammatically, "they" most likely refers to clouds (3:20). In context, "they" may refer to wisdom and understanding (3:13).] not escape from your _sight_; ^[Literally "eyes"]
may you keep sound wisdom and prudence.

###### v22
They shall be life for your soul ^[Or "inner self"]
and adornment ^[Or "favor"] for your neck.

If you sit down, you will not panic, ^[Or "fear, dread"]

Do not plot harm against your neighbor
_who_ dwells in confidence beside you.

###### v30
Do not quarrel with anyone without cause,
when he did not do you harm.

###### v31
Do not envy a man of violence,

###### v34
With those who scorn, he is scornful,
but to those who are humble, he gives favor.

They will inherit the honor of the wise,
but stubborn fools, disgrace.
