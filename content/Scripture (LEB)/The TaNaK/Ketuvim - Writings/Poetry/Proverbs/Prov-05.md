###### v1
My child, be attentive to my wisdom,
and to my understanding incline your ear;

###### v2
_in order_ to keep prudence,
and knowledge will guard your lips.

###### v3
For the lips of the strange woman will drip honey,
and smoother than oil is her mouth. ^[Or "palate"]

###### v4
But her end is bitter as the wormwood,
sharp as a two-edged sword.

###### v5
Her feet go down _to_ death;
her steps take hold _of_ Sheol. ^[A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld]

###### v6
She does not observe ^[Or "examine, weigh"] the path of life;
her ways wander, _and_ she does not know _it_.

###### v7
Now, O children, listen to me;
do not depart from the sayings of my mouth.

###### v8
Keep your paths far from her,
and do not go near to the door of her house,

###### v9
lest you give your honor to the others,
and your years to the merciless,

###### v10
lest strangers take _their_ fill of your strength,
and your labors _go_ to the house of a foreigner,

###### v11
and you groan at your end,
when your flesh and body are consumed,

###### v12
and say "How I hated discipline,
and I despised reproof!"

###### v13
and "I did not listen to the voice of my teachers,
and I did not incline my ear to my instructors!

###### v14
I was almost at utter ^[Or "all, every, whole"] ruin ^[Or "evil"]
in the midst of the assembly and congregation."

###### v15
Drink water from your _own_ cistern
and flowing waters from inside your own well.

###### v16
Shall your springs be scattered outward?
In the streets, _shall there be_ streams of water?

###### v17
May they be yours alone,
and not for strangers _who are_ with you.

###### v18
May your fountain be blessed,
and rejoice in the wife ^[Or "woman"] of your youth.

###### v19
_She is_ a deer of love and a doe of grace;
may her breasts satisfy you _always_; ^[Literally "at all time"]
by her love may you be intoxicated continually.

###### v20
Why should you be intoxicated, my child, by a strange woman,
and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?

###### v21
For before the eyes of Yahweh _are_ _human ways_, ^[Literally "the ways of man/humankind"]
and all his paths he examines.

###### v22
His iniquities shall ensnare him, the evildoer,
and in the vanity of his sin he shall be caught.

###### v23
He shall die _for lack of_ ^[Literally "with there is no"] discipline,
and in the greatness of his folly he shall be lost.
