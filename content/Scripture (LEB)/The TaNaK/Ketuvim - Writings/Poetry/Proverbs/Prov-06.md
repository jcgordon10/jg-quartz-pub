My child, if you have pledged to your neighbor,
_if_ you have bound _yourself_ ^[Literally "palms of your hands"] to the stranger,

###### v2
_if_ you are snared by the sayings of your mouth,
_if_ you are caught by the sayings of your mouth,

###### v3
do this, then, my child, and save yourself,
for you have come into _the palm of your neighbor's hand_: ^[Literally "the palm of the hand of your neighbor"]
Go, humble yourself, plead with your neighbor.

Do not give sleep to your eyes,
or slumber to your eyelids.

Go to the ant, lazy!
Consider its ways and be wise.

In the summer, it prepares its food;
in the harvest, it gathers its sustenance.

###### v9
How long will you lie down, lazy?
When will you rise up from your sleep?

###### v10
A little sleep, a little slumber,
a little folding of the hands for rest--

###### v11
like a _robber_ ^[Literally "one who walks," that is, a vagabond] shall your poverty come,
and what you lack like an armed man.

###### v12
A worthless man, an evil man,
goes around with _deceitful speech_. ^[Literally "crookedness of mouth"]

pointing in his fingers,

###### v14
perversion in his heart, he devises evil;
at all times he will send out discord. ^[Or "quarrels"]

###### v15
Upon _such a man_, ^[Literally "thus"] suddenly shall his calamity come;
in a moment he will be damaged and there is no healing. ^[Or "repair"]

###### v16
There are six _things_ Yahweh hates,
and seven _things are_ abominations of his soul: ^[Or "inner self"]

haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
and hands that shed innocent blood,

###### v18
a devising heart, plans of deception,
feet that hurry to run to evil, ^[Hebrew "the evil"]

###### v19
a false witness who breathes lies
and sends out discord ^[Or "quarrels"] between brothers.

My child, keep _the_ commandment of your father,
and do not disregard _the_ instruction of your mother.

###### v21
Bind them on your heart continually;
tie them upon your neck.

###### v22
_When you walk_, ^[Literally "In your walking"] she ^[That is, "commandment" and "instruction"] will lead you,
_When you lie down_, ^[Literally "In your lying down"] she will watch over you,
and _when_ you awake, she will converse _with_ you.

###### v23
For _like_ a lamp _is_ a commandment, and instruction _is_ light,
and the way of life ^[Hebrew "lives"] _is the_ reproof of discipline,

_in order_ to preserve you from an evil woman, ^[Or "wife"]
from the smoothness of _the_ tongue of _an adulteress_. ^[Literally "a foreign woman"]

Do not desire her beauty in your heart;
may she not capture you with her eyelashes.

###### v27
Can a man carry fire in his lap,
and his clothes not burn?

Thus, he who goes to the wife of his neighbor,
any who touches her shall not go unpunished.

to fill himself ^[Or "soul," or "inner self"] when he is hungry.

###### v31
But _if_ he is found, he will pay sevenfold,
every possession of his house he shall give.

###### v32
He who commits adultery _with_ a woman lacks _sense_, ^[Literally "heart"]
he destroys himself ^[Or "his soul," or "his life"] who does it.

A wound and dishonor he will find,
and his disgrace will not be wiped out.

###### v34
For jealousy _is the_ fury of a husband,
and he will not show restraint on the day of revenge.

and he will not be willing, though the bribe is large.
