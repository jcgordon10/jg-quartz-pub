My child, guard my sayings;
store my commandments with you.

Bind them on your fingers;
write them on the tablet of your heart.

###### v4
Say to wisdom, ^[Hebrew "the wisdom"] "you are my sister,"
and you shall call insight, ^[Hebrew "the insight"] "_intimate friend_." ^[Literally "one who is known." To "know" is often a euphemism for intercourse. Therefore "intimate friend" may also be read "lover."]

from the foreigner who _makes her words smooth_. ^[Literally "causes to be smooth her words"]

For at the window of my house,
through my lattice, I looked down.

And I saw among the simple,
I observed among the youth,
a young man lacking _sense_, ^[Literally "heart"]

###### v8
passing on the street _at_ ^[Literally "at the place of"] her corner,

She is loud and stubborn;
her feet do not stay at her house.

###### v12
Now in the street, now in the square,
_at_ ^[Literally "at the place of"] every corner she lies in wait.

###### v13
She took hold of  ^[Or "strengthened"] him and kissed him.
Her face was impudent, and she said to him,

###### v14
"Sacrifices of peace offerings _are_ upon me;
_today_ ^[Literally "the day"] I completed my vows.

###### v15
So ^[Hebrew "thus"] I have come out to meet you,
to seek your face, and I have found you.

###### v16
_With_ coverings I have adorned my couch,
spreads of the linen of Egypt;

###### v17
I have perfumed my bed _with_ myrrh,
aloes, and cinnamon.

###### v18
Come, let us take _our_ fill of love making,
until the morning let us delight in love.

###### v19
For there is no man ^[Or "husband"] in his home;
he has gone on a _long journey_. ^[Literally "a journey from far"]

The bag of money he took in his hand,
for _on_ the day of the full moon he will come home."

###### v21
She persuades him with the greatness of her teachings;

He goes after her suddenly;
like an ox to the slaughter he goes,
and like a stag to the instruction of a fool,

###### v23
until an arrow pierces his _entrails_, ^[Literally "heaviness," often referring to the liver]
like a bird rushing into a snare,
but he does not know that _it will cost him his life_. ^[Literally "it is against his life"]

And now, my children, listen to me,
and be attentive to the sayings of my mouth.

and countless ^[Or "strong men"] _are_ all of her killings.

###### v27
The ways of Sheol ^[A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld] _are_ her house,
descending to chambers of death.
