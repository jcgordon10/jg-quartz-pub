Do not tire _in order_ to become rich;
out of your understanding, _may you_ desist.

You, my child, hear and be wise,

To those who linger over wine,
to those who come to try mixed wine.

when it _sparkles_ ^[Literally "gives its eye"] on the cup,
going down smoothly.

###### v32
_In the end_, ^[Literally "end him"] it will bite like a serpent,
and it will sting like an adder.

###### v33
Your eyes will see strange things,
and your heart ^[Or "mind"] will speak perverse things.
