###### v1
Do not boast _about tomorrow_, ^[Literally "on the day of tomorrow"]
for you do not know what the day will bring.

###### v2
May another praise you and not your own mouth,
a stranger and not your own lips.

###### v3
Heavy _is_ a stone and weighty _is_ sand,
but _the_ provocation of a fool _is_ heavier than both of them.

###### v4
Cruel _is_ wrath and overwhelming _is_ anger,

Better a rebuke that is open
than a love that is hidden.

###### v6
The wounds of a friend mean well,
but the kisses of an enemy are profane.

###### v7
An _appetite_ ^[Literally "soul"] that is sated spurns honey,
but _to_ an _appetite_ ^[Literally "soul"] that is ravenous, all bitterness _is_ sweet.

###### v8
Like a bird that strays from its nest,
so is a man who strays from his place.

###### v9
Perfume and incense will gladden a heart,
and the pleasantness of one's friend _is_ _personal advice_. ^[Literally "because of advice of a person"]

As for your friend and a friend of your father, do not forsake _them_,
and the house of your brother, do not enter on the day of your calamity.

###### v11
Be wise, my child, and make my heart glad,
and I will answer him who reproaches me _with_ a word.

Take his garment, for he gives surety _to_ a stranger,

###### v14
He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice
early in the morning,
a curse will be reckoned to him.

Dripping constantly on a day of heavy rain
and a woman ^[Or "wife"] of contention are alike.

###### v16
_In_ restraining her, he restrains wind, ^[Or "breath, or "spirit"]
and his right hand will grasp oil ^[Or "fat"].

###### v17
_As_ iron sharpens ^[Or "is united with"] iron,
so _one man sharpens another_. ^[Literally "a man sharpens _the_ faces of his friend"]

###### v18
He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
and he who guards his master ^[Or "lord"] will be honored.

###### v19
As the waters _reflect_ _face to face_, ^[Literally "the faces to the faces"]
so the heart of a person _reflects_ the person.

###### v20
Sheol ^[A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld] and Abaddon ^[Poetic synonym for "Sheol." Only mentioned in the ot in relation to Sheol, the grave, or death.] will not be satisfied,
and the eyes of a person will not be satisfied _either_.

and goats the price of the field.
