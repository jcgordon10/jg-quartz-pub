###### v2
By the rebellion of a land, her rulers increase,

###### v5
Men of evil do not understand justice,

###### v6
Better _to be_ poor and walking in one's integrity

_Like_ a roaring lion and a charging bear

A person who is burdened with _the_ blood of _another_, ^[Literally "life"]

###### v19
He who tills his ground will have plenty bread,

A man of faithfulness _has_ abundant blessings,
but he who hurries to become rich will not go unpunished.

and over a morsel of bread, a strong man will do wrong.

and with their perishing, _the_ righteous will multiply.
