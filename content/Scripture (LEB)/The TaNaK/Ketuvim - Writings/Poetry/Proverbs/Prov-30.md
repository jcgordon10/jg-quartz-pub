###### v1
The words of Agur, son of Yakeh, the oracle.
Thus says the man to Ithiel, to Ithiel, and Ucal: ^[Or "I am weary, O God; I am weary, O God, and worn out"]

###### v2
Certainly I _am more_ stupid than a man,
and the understanding of humankind _is_ not for me.

###### v3
And I have not learned wisdom,
nor will I know knowledge of the Holy One. ^[Or "holy ones"]

###### v4
Who has ascended _to_ heaven and come down?
Who has gathered _the_ wind in the hollow of his hand?
Who has wrapped water in a ^[Hebrew "the"] garment?
Who has established all the ends of the earth?
What _is_ his name and what is the name of his child?
For _surely_ you know.

###### v5
Every word of God _is_ flawless;
he _is_ a shield for him who takes refuge in him.

###### v6
Do not add to his words
lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.

###### v7
Two things I ask from you;
do not deny me before I die:

###### v8
Keep falsehood and a _lying word_ ^[Literally "word of a lie"] far from me;
do not give me poverty or wealth;
provide me _with_ food _only for_ my need.

###### v9
Or else I will be satisfied and will deny _him_
and say "Who _is_ Yahweh?"
Or ^[Or "Lest"] I will be poor and will steal
and profane the name of my God.

###### v10
Do not slander a servant to his master,
or else he will curse you and you will be guilty.

###### v11
_There is_ a generation _that_ will curse its father,
and its mother it will not bless.

###### v12
_There is_ a generation _that is_ pure in its own eyes,
but from its filthiness it will not be cleansed.

###### v13
_There is_ a generation--how lofty _are_ their eyes!
And their eyelids they will lift.

###### v14
_There is_ a generation whose teeth _are_ swords,
and its jawbones, knives,
_in order_ to devour the poor from the earth ^[Or "land"]
and the needy from humankind.

###### v15
For the leech, _there are_ two daughters;
"Give, give!" _they cry_.
As for three of these, they are not satisfied;
as for four, they do not say enough.

###### v16
Sheol ^[A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld] and barrenness of womb,
the land is not satisfied _with_ water,
and fire does not say "enough!"

###### v17
The eye _that_ mocks a father
and scorns the obedience of a mother--
the ravens of the valley will peck it out,
and the offspring of vultures will eat it.

###### v18
Three of these are _too_ wonderful for me,
and four, I do not understand them:

###### v19
the way of the eagle in the sky,
the way of a snake on a rock,
the way of a ship in the heart of the sea,
and the way of a man with a young woman.

###### v20
This is the way of a woman committing adultery:
she eats and wipes her mouth,
and says "I have not done wrong."

###### v21
Under three _things_ the earth ^[Or "land"] trembles,
and under four, it is not able to bear up:

###### v22
under a slave when he becomes king,
and a fool when he is satisfied _with_ food;

###### v23
under an unloved woman when she gets married,
and a maid when she succeeds her mistress.

###### v24
There _are_ four small things on the earth,
and they _are_ _exceedingly wise_: ^[Literally "wise _ones_ from wise _ones_"]

###### v25
The ants _are_ a people _who are_ not strong,
yet they prepare their food in the summer;

###### v26
the badgers _are_ a people _who are_ not mighty,
yet they set their house on the rock;

###### v27
there is no king for the locust,
yet it marches in rank;

###### v28
a lizard you _can_ seize with hands,
yet it is in palaces of kings.

###### v29
There _are_ three _things_ that are magnificent of stride,
and four that are magnificent _when_ moving:

###### v30
a mighty lion among the beasts, ^[Hebrew "beasts"]
but he will not turn back from _any face_; ^[Literally "faces of all"]

###### v31
a strutting rooster or he-goat,
and a king _whose_ army _is_ with him.

###### v32
If you have been foolish by exalting yourself,
and if you have devised evil, _put your_ hand to _your_ mouth.

###### v33
For pressing milk produces curd,
and pressing the nose produces blood,
so pressing _anger_ ^[Literally "nostrils"] produces strife.
