###### v1
The words of Lemuel, _the_ king--an oracle
that his mother taught him:

What, my son? And what, my son in my womb?
And what, son of my vows?

###### v3
Do not give your strength to the women,
and your ways to destroy kings.

###### v4
_It is_ not for the kings, O Lemuel;
drinking wine _is_ not for the kings,
nor _is_ strong drink for rulers.

Or else he will drink and forget what has been decreed,
and he will pervert the rights ^[Hebrew "right"] of all the _afflicted_. ^[Literally "sons of affliction"]

He will drink and forget his poverty,
and his misery he will not remember _any_ more.

Open your mouth for the mute,
for the rights ^[Hebrew "right"] of all the _needy_. ^[Literally "the sons of the needy"]

Open your mouth, judge righteousness,
and defend _the_ poor and needy.

A woman ^[Or "wife"] of excellence, ^[Or "strength," or "valor," or "ability," or "efficiency"] who will find?

She seeks wool and flax,
and she works with the diligence of _her hands_. ^[Literally "her palms"]

She is like the ships of a merchant;
from far off she brings her food; ^[Or "bread"]

###### v15
And she arises while _it is_ still night,
and gives food to her household,
and tasks to her servant girls.

and makes her arms strong.

her lamp does not go out in the night.

###### v19
Her hands she puts onto the distaff, ^[A stick or spindle onto which wool or flax is wound in preparation for spinning]
and her palms hold a spindle.

###### v20
Her palm she opens to the poor,
and her hand she reaches _out_ to the needy.

###### v21
She does not fear for her house _when_ it snows,
for _her entire household_ ^[Literally "all her house, household"] is clothed _in_ crimson.

She looks after the ways of her household,
and the bread of idleness she will not eat.

###### v28
Her children rise and consider her happy,
her husband ^[Or "lord"] _also_, and he praises her;

###### v29
"Many daughters have done excellence, ^[Or "strength," or "valor," or "ability," or "efficiency"]
but _you surpass_ ^[Literally "you ascend over"] all of them."

###### v30
Charm ^[Hebrew "The charm"] _is_ deceit and beauty ^[Hebrew "the beauty"] _is_ vain; ^[Or "vapor," or "emptiness," or "breath"]
_but_ a woman who fears Yahweh shall be praised.

Give to her from the fruit of her hand,
and may they praise her works in the city gates.
