[[Ps-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of _the_ wicked;
nor does he stand in _the_ way of sinners;
nor does he sit in _the_ assembly of mockers.

###### v2
Instead, in the law of Yahweh _is_ his delight,
and on his law he meditates day and night.

###### v3
And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water
that gives its fruit in its season;
its leaf also does not wither.
Therefore all that he does prospers.

###### v4
Not so the wicked.
Instead, _they are_ like the chaff that _the_ wind scatters.

###### v5
Therefore _the_ wicked will not stand in the judgment,
nor sinners in the congregation of _the_ righteous;

###### v6
for Yahweh knows _the_ way of _the_ righteous, ^[Plural]
but _the_ way of _the_ wicked will perish.
