###### v1
Why are nations in tumult,
and countries plotting ^[Or "muttering"] in vain? ^[Or "an empty thing"]

###### v2
_The_ kings of _the_ earth establish themselves,
and the rulers conspire ^[Or "make themselves firm"] together
against Yahweh and his anointed:

###### v3
"Let us tear off their bonds,
and cast their cords from us!"

###### v4
_He who_ sits _enthroned_ in the heavens laughs.
The Lord derides them.

###### v5
Then he speaks to them in his wrath,
and in his fury he terrifies them:

###### v6
"But as for me, I have set my king
on Zion, my holy mountain."

###### v7
I will tell the decree;
Yahweh said to me:
"You are my son;
today I have begotten you.

###### v8
Ask from me and I will make _the_ nations your heritage,
and your possession _the_ ends of _the_ earth.

###### v9
You will break them with an iron rod.
Like a potter's vessel you will shatter them."

###### v10
So then, O kings, be wise.
Be warned, O rulers of _the_ earth.

###### v11
Serve Yahweh with fear,
and rejoice with trembling.

###### v12
Kiss the Son
lest he be angry and you perish _on the_ way,
for his anger burns quickly.
Blessed are all _who_ take refuge in him.
