###### v1
Yahweh, how many are my enemies;
many _are_ rising against me.

###### v2
Many _are_ saying about my soul,
"There is no deliverance for him from ^[Or "in"] God. _Selah_ ^[Meaning uncertain; probably a musical or liturgical direction]

###### v3
But ^[Or "And"] you, Yahweh, _are_ a shield around me,
my glory and the one who lifts up my head.

###### v4
_With_ my voice I call to Yahweh
and he answers me from _his holy hill_. ^[Literally "the hill of his holiness"] _Selah_

###### v5
I lay down and slept;
I woke up because Yahweh sustains me.

###### v6
I am not afraid of the ten thousands of people
who all around have set themselves against me.

###### v7
Rise up, O Yahweh; deliver me, O my God;
for you strike all my enemies _on the_ cheek.
_The_ teeth of _the_ wicked you break.

###### v8
To Yahweh belongs deliverance;
_may_ your blessing _be_ over your people. _Selah_
