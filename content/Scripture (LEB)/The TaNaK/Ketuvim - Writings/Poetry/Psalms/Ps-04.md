###### v1
When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness. ^[Or "vindication"]
In trouble _deliver me_. ^[Literally "make wide for me"]
Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.

###### v2
O sons of man, how long will my honor ^[Or "glory"] be a disgrace?
_How long_ will you love vanity?
_How long_ will you seek lies? ^[Or "falsehood"] _Selah_

###### v3
But know that Yahweh has set apart ^[Or "treated specially"] for himself _the_ faithful one. ^[Or "pious, godly one"]
Yahweh hears when I call to him.

###### v4
Be disturbed but do not sin.
Commune in your heart ^[That is, "think it over"] on your bed and be silent. _Selah_

###### v5
Offer correct sacrifices, ^[Or "right sacrifices"]
and _trust in_ ^[Literally "trust to"] Yahweh.

###### v6
Many are saying, "Who will show us _something_ good?"
Lift up over ^[Or "upon"] us the light of your face, O Yahweh.

###### v7
You have put gladness in my heart
more than _when_ ^[Literally "the time of"] their grain and their wine abound.

###### v8
In peace I will lie down and sleep _at once_, ^[Literally "together"]
for you alone, O Yahweh, make me dwell safely.
