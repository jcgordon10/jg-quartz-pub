###### v1
O Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger,
and do not discipline me in your wrath.

###### v2
Be gracious to me, O Yahweh, because I am feeble.
Heal me, O Yahweh, for my bones are terrified.

###### v3
My soul is also very terrified.
But you, O Yahweh, how long?

###### v4
Turn, O Yahweh; deliver my life. ^[Or "my soul"; same word as in v. [[Ps-06#v3|3]]]
Save me for the sake of your steadfast love. ^[Or "loyal love"]

###### v5
For there is no remembrance of you in death.
In Sheol, who will give thanks to you?

###### v6
I am weary with my groaning;
_I flood_ ^[Literally "I make my bed float"] my bed every night.
With my tears _I drench_ ^[Literally "I cause to melt"] my couch.

###### v7
My eye wastes away because of vexation;
it grows old because of all my oppressors.

###### v8
Depart from me, all workers of evil,
for Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping.

###### v9
Yahweh has heard my plea;
Yahweh has accepted my prayer.

###### v10
All my enemies shall be ashamed and shall be very terrified.
They shall turn back; they shall suddenly be ashamed.
