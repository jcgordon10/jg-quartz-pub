###### v1
Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic _is_ your name in all the earth,
who put your splendor above the heavens.

###### v2
From the mouth of children and infants you have founded ^[Or "ordained"] strength
on account of your enemies,
to silence _the_ enemy and _the_ avenger.

###### v3
When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,
_the_ moon and _the_ stars which you set in place--

###### v4
what _is_ a human being that you think of him?
and a child of humankind that you care for him?

###### v5
And you made him a little lower than heavenly beings, ^[Or "than God"]
and _with_ glory and _with_ majesty you crowned him.

###### v6
You make him over the works of your hands;
all _things_ you have placed under his feet:

###### v7
sheep and cattle, all of them,
and also _the_ wild animals of _the_ field,

###### v8
_the_ birds of _the_ sky and the fish of the sea,
_everything_ that passes along the paths of seas.

###### v9
Yahweh, our Lord,
how majestic _is_ your name in all of the earth!
