###### v1
Shout in triumph to Yahweh, all the earth.

###### v2
Serve ^[Or "Worship"] Yahweh with joy;
come into his presence with exultation.

###### v3
Know that Yahweh, he _is_ God;
he made us and we are his. ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_); the _Kethib_ reads "and not we _ourselves_"]
_We are_ his people and the sheep of his pasture.

###### v4
Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
his courts with praise.
Give thanks to him; bless his name.

###### v5
For Yahweh _is_ good; his loyal love is forever,
and his faithfulness _is_ _from generation to generation_. ^[Literally "unto a generation and a generation"]
