###### v1
I will sing of loyal love and justice;
I will sing praises to you, O Yahweh.

###### v2
I will give attention to _the_ way of integrity.
When will you come to me?
I will walk in the integrity of my heart
in the midst of my house.

###### v3
I will not set before my eyes
any wicked thing.
I hate the work of those who fall away; ^[The term "those who fall away" is a rare noun. The verb from the same root is found in [[Ps-40#v5|Psa 40:5]](4)]
it will not cling to me.

###### v4
A perverse heart will depart from me;
I will not know evil.

###### v5
One who slanders his neighbor in secret,
him I will destroy.
_One_ haughty of eyes and _arrogant_ ^[Literally "wide"] of heart,
him I will not endure.

###### v6
My eyes _will be_ on _the_ faithful of _the_ land,
that _they may_ live with me.
_He who_ walks in _the_ way of integrity,
he shall minister to me.

###### v7
There will not live in the midst of my house
a worker of deceit.
One who speaks lies
will not remain ^[Hebrew "be established"] before my eyes.

###### v8
_Each morning_, ^[Literally "to the mornings"]
I will destroy all _the_ wicked of _the_ land,
cutting off from the city of Yahweh all evildoers.
