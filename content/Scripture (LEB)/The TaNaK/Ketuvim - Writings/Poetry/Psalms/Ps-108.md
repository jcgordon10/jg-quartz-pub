###### v1
My heart _is_ steadfast, O God.
I will sing and give praise, even _with_ my glory.

I will awake _the_ dawn. ^[Or "I will awake at dawn"]

###### v3
I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Yahweh;
I will give you praise among the nations,

###### v4
because your loyal love _is_ great above _the_ heavens,
and your faithfulness _reaches_ to _the_ clouds.

###### v5
Be exalted above _the_ heavens, O God,
and _let_ your glory _be_ above all the earth,

###### v6
so that your beloved ones may be rescued.
Save by your right hand and answer me.

###### v7
God has spoken in his holiness,
"I will exult, I will divide up Shechem,
and portion out the valley of Succoth.

###### v8
Gilead _is_ mine. Manasseh _is_ mine.
And Ephraim _is_ the _helmet for_ ^[Literally "protection of"] my head.
Judah _is_ my scepter; ^[Or "commander's rod"]

###### v9
Moab _is_ my washing pot.
Over Edom I will cast my sandal;
Over Philistia I will shout in triumph."

Who will lead me to Edom?

Have you not rejected us, O God,
and not gone out with our armies, O God?

Give us help against _the_ enemy,
for the help of humankind _is_ futile.

Through God we will do valiantly, ^[Hebrew "do might"]
and _it is_ he _who_ will tread down our enemies.
