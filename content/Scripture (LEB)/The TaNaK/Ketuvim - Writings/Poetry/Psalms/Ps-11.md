###### v1
In Yahweh I have taken refuge;
how can you say to my soul,
"Flee to your mountain _like_ a bird"?

###### v2
For look: The wicked _string the bow_. ^[Literally "tread the bow," that is, placing the foot on the bow to bend and string it]
They have fitted their arrow to _the_ string,
to shoot from _the_ darkness
at the upright of heart.

###### v3
When the foundations are destroyed
what can _the_ righteous do? ^[Or "what has the righteous done"]

###### v4
Yahweh _is_ in his holy temple;
Yahweh _is_ in the heavens _on_ his throne.
His eyelids see;
they test _the_ children of humankind.

###### v5
Yahweh tests _the_ righteous,
but _the_ wicked and _the_ lover of violence
his soul hates.

###### v6
He will rain coals ^[According to Symmachus (compare also _Targum Psalms_) a form slightly different from the MT's "snares"] on _the_ wicked.
Burning sulfur and scorching wind
_will be_ the portion of their cup.

###### v7
For Yahweh _is_ righteous;
he loves righteous deeds.
_The_ upright shall see his face.
