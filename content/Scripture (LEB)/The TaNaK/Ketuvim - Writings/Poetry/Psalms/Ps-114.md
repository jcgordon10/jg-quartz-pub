###### v1
When Israel went out from Egypt,
the house of Jacob from a people of a strange language,

###### v2
Judah became his sanctuary,
Israel his dominion.

###### v3
The sea looked and fled;
the Jordan turned back.

###### v4
The mountains skipped like rams,
_the_ hills like _lambs_. ^[Literally "sons of _the_ flock"]

###### v5
What's with you, O sea, _that_ you fled?
O Jordan, _that_ you turned back?

###### v6
O mountains, _that_ you skipped like rams?
O hills, like lambs?

###### v7
At the presence of _the_ Lord writhe, O earth, ^[Or "O land"]
at the presence of the God of Jacob,

###### v8
who turned the rock into a pool of water,
flinty stone into a spring of water.
