[[Ps-11|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-13|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Save, O Yahweh, for _the_ pious have ceased _to be_;
for _the_ faithful have vanished
from _among the_ children of humankind.

###### v2
They speak falseness _to each other_. ^[Literally "each with his companion"]
_With_ flattering lips,
_with_ _a double heart_ ^[Literally "a heart and a heart"] they speak.

###### v3
May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips,
_the_ tongue speaking great boasts--

###### v4
_those_ who say, "With our tongue we will prevail.
Our lips _are_ on our side.
Who _is_ master over us?"

###### v5
"Because of _the_ oppression of _the_ afflicted,
because of _the_ groaning of _the_ poor,
now I will rise up," Yahweh says.
"I shall put _them_ in _the_ safety _for which_ they ^[Hebrew "he"] long."

###### v6
The words of Yahweh _are_ pure words
_like_ silver refined in the crucible on the ground,
refined seven times.

###### v7
You, O Yahweh, will protect them.
You will preserve him ^[Or "us"]
from this generation always.

###### v8
_The_ wicked prowl about
when vileness _is_ exalted among _the_ children of humankind.
