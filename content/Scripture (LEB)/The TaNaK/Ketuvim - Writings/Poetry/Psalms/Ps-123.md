[[Ps-122|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-124|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
I lift up my eyes to you,
the one enthroned ^[Or "the one who dwells"] in the heavens.

###### v2
Behold, as _the_ eyes of servants
_look_ to the hand of their master, ^[Hebrew "masters"]
as _the_ eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,
so our eyes _look_ to Yahweh our God,
until he is gracious to us.

###### v3
Be gracious to us, O Yahweh, be gracious to us,
for long enough we have had our fill of contempt.

###### v4
For long enough our soul has had its fill of
the derision of the self-confident,
the contempt of _the_ arrogant.
