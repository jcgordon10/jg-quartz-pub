###### v1
"If _it had_ not _been_ Yahweh who was on our side,"
do let Israel say,

###### v2
"If _it had_ not _been_ Yahweh who was on our side,
when men rose up against us,

###### v3
then they would have swallowed us alive,
when their anger was kindled against us.

###### v4
Then the waters would have flooded over us,
_the_ torrent would have passed over our soul.

###### v5
Then over our soul would have passed
the raging waters."

###### v6
Blessed _be_ Yahweh,
who has not made ^[Hebrew "given"] us prey for their teeth.

###### v7
Our soul has escaped like a bird
from _the_ snare of fowlers.
The snare _is_ broken, and we have escaped.

###### v8
Our help _is_ in the name of Yahweh,
maker of heaven and earth.
