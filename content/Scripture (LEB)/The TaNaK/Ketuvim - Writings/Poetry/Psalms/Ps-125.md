[[Ps-124|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-126|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Those who trust in Yahweh
_are_ like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved,
_but_ abides forever.

###### v2
_As_ mountains _are_ round about Jerusalem,
so Yahweh _is_ round about his people,
from now until forever.

###### v3
For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest
on the _land_ ^[Literally "lot," that is, land allotted] of the righteous,
lest the righteous stretch out
their hands to do wickedness. ^[Hebrew "in wickedness"]

###### v4
Do good, O Yahweh, to the good,
and to _those_ upright in their hearts.

###### v5
But regarding those who turn aside to their crooked ways,
Yahweh will lead them away with the evildoers.
Peace _be_ upon Israel.
