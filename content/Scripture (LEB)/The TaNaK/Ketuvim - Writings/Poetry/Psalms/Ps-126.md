[[Ps-125|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-127|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
When Yahweh restored the fortunes ^[Or "captivity"] of Zion, ^[Or "_those_ returned of _belonging to_ Zion"]
we were like dreamers.

###### v2
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with rejoicing.
Then they said among the nations,
"Yahweh has done great _things_ for these _people_."

###### v3
Yahweh has done great _things_ for us;
we are glad.

###### v4
Restore, O Yahweh, our fortunes ^[Or "captivity"]
like the streams in the Negeb. ^[Or "South"]

###### v5
Those who sow with tears
shall reap with rejoicing.

###### v6
He who diligently goes _out_ with weeping,
carrying the seed bag,
shall certainly come _in_ with rejoicing,
carrying his sheaves.
