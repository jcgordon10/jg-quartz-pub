[[Ps-126|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-128|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Unless Yahweh builds a house,
its builders labor at it in vain.
Unless Yahweh guards a city,
a guard watches in vain.

###### v2
_It is_ in vain for you who rise early _and_ sit late,
eating the bread of anxious toil,
_when_ thus he ^[That is, Yahweh] provides ^[Hebrew "gives"] for his beloved in _his_ sleep. ^[Or "so he gives sleep to his beloved"]

###### v3
Look, children ^[Hebrew "sons"] _are_ the heritage ^[That is, gift] of Yahweh;
the fruit of the womb _is_ a reward.

###### v4
Like arrows in _the_ hand of a warrior,
so _are_ the children ^[Hebrew "sons"] of _one's_ youth.

###### v5
Blessed _is_ the man who fills his quiver with them. ^[Or "whose quiver he _Yahweh_ fills with them"]
They shall not be put to shame
when they speak with enemies at the gate.
