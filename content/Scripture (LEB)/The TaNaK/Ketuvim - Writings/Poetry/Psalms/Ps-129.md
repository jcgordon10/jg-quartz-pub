[[Ps-128|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-130|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
"Too often ^[Or "Greatly"] they have attacked me from my youth."
Let Israel say,

###### v2
"Too often ^[Or "Greatly"] they have attacked me from my youth,
yet they have not prevailed against me.

###### v3
On my back plowmen have plowed.
They have made their furrows ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] long."

###### v4
Yahweh _is_ righteous.
He has cut _the_ ropes ^[That is, the yoke and tackle on a beast of burden] of _the_ wicked.

###### v5
Let all be put to shame and repulsed
who hate Zion.

###### v6
Let them be like grass on _the_ housetops,
that withers before it grows up,

###### v7
_with_ which a reaper cannot fill his hand,
nor the binder of sheaves his _arms_, ^[Literally "bosom"]

###### v8
so that passersby do not say,
"The blessing of Yahweh _be_ upon you.
We bless you in the name of Yahweh."
