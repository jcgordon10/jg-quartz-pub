###### v1
How long, O Yahweh? Will you forget me forever?
How long will you hide your face from me?

###### v2
How long must I take counsel ^[Hebrew pl.; with a slight modification of the Hebrew this reads "set pains"] in my soul,
_and_ sorrow in my heart _all the_ day?
How long will my enemy be exalted over me?

###### v3
Consider ^[Literally "Look"] _and_ answer me, O Yahweh my God.
Give light to my eyes
lest I sleep _the sleep of_ death,

###### v4
_and_ lest my enemy should say, "I have overcome him,"
_lest_ my enemies rejoice because I am shaken.

###### v5
But as for me, I have trusted in your steadfast love. ^[Or, "loyal love"]
My heart will rejoice in your deliverance.

###### v6
 ^[In the Hebrew Bible, the previous verse continues] I will sing to Yahweh
because he has dealt bountifully with me.
