[[Ps-129|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-131|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Out of _the_ depths I call to you, O Yahweh.

###### v2
"O Lord, hear my voice.
Let your ears be attentive
to the voice of my supplications.

###### v3
If you, O Yah, ^[A shortened form of "Yahweh"] should _keep track of_ ^[Literally "keep"] iniquities,
O Lord, who could stand?

###### v4
But with you _is_ forgiveness,
so that you may be feared."

###### v5
I await Yahweh; my soul awaits,
and I wait ^[Or "hope," here and v. [[Ps-130#v7|7]], though the Hebrew uses a different verbal stem in v. [[Ps-130#v7|7]]] for his word.

###### v6
My soul _waits_ for the Lord
more than watchmen for the morning.
Yes, _more than_ watchmen for the morning.

###### v7
O Israel, wait ^[Or "hope"] for Yahweh.
For with Yahweh _there is_ loyal love,
and with him _there is_ abundant redemption.

###### v8
And he will redeem Israel
from all its iniquities.
