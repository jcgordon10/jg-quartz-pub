[[Ps-130|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-132|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
My heart is not haughty nor my eyes _arrogant_. ^[Literally "raised"]
And I do not _concern myself_ ^[Literally "walk about"]
with things too great and difficult for me.

###### v2
Rather I have soothed and quieted my soul,
like a weaned child with its mother,
like the weaned child _is_ my soul with me.

###### v3
O Israel, hope in Yahweh
from now until forever.
