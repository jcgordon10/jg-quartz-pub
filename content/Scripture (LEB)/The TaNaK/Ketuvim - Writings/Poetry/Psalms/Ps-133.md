[[Ps-132|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-134|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Look, how good and how pleasant _it is_
_when_ brothers dwell together in unity.

###### v2
_It is_ like the fragrant oil upon the head,
running down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron,
that runs down upon the edges of his robes.

###### v3
_It is_ like the dew of Hermon that runs down
upon the mountains of Zion,
because there Yahweh commanded the blessing--
life forever.
