[[Ps-136|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-138|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
By the rivers of Babylon,
there we sat, yes, we wept,
when we remembered Zion.

###### v2
On _the_ willows ^[Species of tree uncertain] in her midst,
we hung up our lyres.

###### v3
For there our captors asked of us
words of a song,
and our tormentors ^[Only occurring once in the MT, this interpretation is uncertain. The LXX's "carried us captive" is a guess. If related to the Hebrew root _yll_ it might have the idea of "mockers/yammerers"] _asked of us_ jubilation,
"Sing for us from a song of Zion."

###### v4
How could we sing the song of Yahweh
in _a foreign land_? ^[Literally "a land of a foreigner"]

###### v5
If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
let my right hand forget. ^[That is, how to play a musical instrument]

###### v6
Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth,
if I do not remember you,
if do not I exalt Jerusalem
above my highest joy.

###### v7
Remember, O Yahweh, against the sons of Edom
the day of Jerusalem,
the ones who said, "Lay _it_ bare! Lay _it_ bare
to its foundation!"

###### v8
O daughter of Babylon, about to be devastated,
happy _shall be he_ who pays back to you
_what you paid out to us_. ^[Literally "_with_ what you treated us"]

###### v9
Happy _shall be he_ who seizes
and smashes your children
against the rock.
