[[Ps-137|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-139|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
I give you thanks with my whole heart;
before _the_ gods I sing your praise.

###### v2
I bow down toward your holy temple
and give thanks to your name,
because of your loyal love and faithfulness,
for you have magnified your word ^[Or "promise"] according to all your name. ^[Or "beyond all your name"]

###### v3
_When_ ^[Literally "In the day"] I called and you answered me,
you emboldened me in my soul _with_ strength.

###### v4
All _the_ kings of _the_ earth
will praise you, O Yahweh,
when they have heard the words ^[Or "heard about the words"] of your mouth,

###### v5
and they will sing of the ways of Yahweh,
because Yahweh's glory _is_ great.

###### v6
Though Yahweh _is_ high, yet he sees _the_ lowly,
but _the_ proud he perceives ^[Hebrew "knows"] at a distance.

###### v7
Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
you preserve me alive.
You stretch out your hand against the anger of my enemies,
and you save me _with_ your right hand.

###### v8
Yahweh accomplishes _things_ for my benefit.
O Yahweh, your loyal love _endures_ forever;
do not abandon the works of your hands.
