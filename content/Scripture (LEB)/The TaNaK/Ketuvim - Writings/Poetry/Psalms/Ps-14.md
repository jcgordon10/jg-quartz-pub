[[Ps-13|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-15|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
_The_ fool says in his heart, "There is no God."
They are corrupt.
They do abominable deeds.
There is none who does good.

###### v2
Yahweh looks down from heaven upon the children of humankind
to see whether there is one who has insight,
one who cares about God.

###### v3
All have gone astray;
they are altogether corrupt.
There is not one who does good;
there is not even one.

###### v4
All who do evil--do they not know,
_they_ who eat my people _as though_ they were eating bread?
They do not call on Yahweh.

###### v5
There _they are very fearful_ ^[Literally "they feared a fear"]
because God _is_ with _the_ generation of _the_ righteous.

###### v6
You would put to shame _the_ plan of _the_ poor,
because ^[Or "but"] Yahweh _is_ his refuge.

###### v7
_Oh that from Zion_ ^[Literally "Who will give _that_ from Zion"] _would come_ salvation _for_ Israel!
When Yahweh returns the fortunes of his people,
Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be happy.
