[[Ps-140|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-142|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
I call on you, O Yahweh; hasten to me.
Listen to my voice when I call to you.

###### v2
Let my prayer be set before you _as_ incense,
the lifting up of my palms _as the_ evening offering.

###### v3
Set a guard, O Yahweh, over my mouth;
keep watch over the door of my lips.

###### v4
Do not incline my heart to any evil thing,
to practice wicked deeds
with men _who_ do iniquity;
and do not let me eat of their delicacies.

###### v5
Let a righteous one strike me in kindness,
and let him chasten me.
_It is_ oil for _my_ head; ^[Or "It is choice oil"] let not my head refuse.
For still my prayer _is_ against their evil deeds.

###### v6
_When_ their judges are thrown down _the_ sides of a cliff, ^[Or "are dropped into the hands of _the_ Rock," that is, Yahweh. The interpretation of vv. [[Ps-141#v6|6–7]][[Ps-141#v7|]] is uncertain.]
then they will understand that my words were pleasant.

###### v7
As _when one_ plows and breaks up the earth,
_so_ our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.

###### v8
But ^[Or "Because"] my eyes _are_ toward you, O Yahweh, my Lord;
I have taken refuge in you. Do not lay bare my soul. ^[Or "Do not raze my life"]

###### v9
Protect me from _the_ _grasp_ ^[Literally "hand"] of _the_ trap they have laid for me,
and _from the_ snares of evildoers.

###### v10
Let _the_ wicked fall into their ^[Hebrew "his"] nets,
while I escape altogether.
