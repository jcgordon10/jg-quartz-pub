[[Ps-141|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-143|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
I cry out with my voice to Yahweh;
I implore favor with my voice to Yahweh.

###### v2
I pour out my complaint before him;
I declare my trouble before him.

###### v3
When my spirit faints within me,
you know my way.
On the path where I walk,
they have hidden a trap for me;

###### v4
look to _my_ right and see.
There is no one looking out for me;
there is no escape for me; ^[Hebrew "a refuge has perished from me"]
no one cares for my soul. ^[Or "life"]

###### v5
I cry out to you, O Yahweh.
I say, "You _are_ my refuge,
my portion in the land of the living."

###### v6
Attend to my cry,
for I am brought very low.
Deliver me from my pursuers,
for they are stronger than I.

###### v7
Bring me ^[Hebrew "my soul"] out of prison,
that I may give thanks to your name.
_The_ righteous will encircle me,
because you will deal bountifully with me.
