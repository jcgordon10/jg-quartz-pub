###### v1
Praise Yah. ^[Hebrew _hallelujah_]
Praise Yahweh, O my soul.

###### v2
I will praise Yahweh while I live;
I will sing praises to my God while I _am_ still _alive_.

###### v3
Do not place trust in princes,
in a son of humankind with whom there is no deliverance.

###### v4
His breath departs; he returns to his plot; ^[A Hebrew wordplay: "humankind," _adam_ (v. [[Ps-146#v3|3]]), returns to his ground/plot, _adamah_]
on that day his plans perish.

###### v5
Blessed _is the one_ whose help _is_ the God of Jacob,
whose hope _is_ on Yahweh _as_ his God,

###### v6
who made heaven and earth,
the sea and all that _is_ in them,
the one who keeps faith ^[Or "remains faithful"] forever,

###### v7
_who_ executes justice for the oppressed,
_who_ gives food for the hungry.
Yahweh sets prisoners free;

###### v8
Yahweh opens _the eyes of the_ blind;
Yahweh raises up _those_ bowed down;
Yahweh loves _the_ righteous;

###### v9
Yahweh protects ^[Or "watches over"] _the_ strangers.
He helps up _the_ orphan and _the_ widow,
but _the_ way of _the_ wicked he _thwarts_. ^[Literally "makes crooked"]

###### v10
Yahweh will reign forever,
Your God, O Zion, _throughout all generations_. ^[Literally "for a generation and a generation"]
Praise Yah. ^[Hebrew _hallelujah_]
