[[Ps-14|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-16|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
O Yahweh, who may reside in your tent?
Who may dwell on your holy mountain?

###### v2
He who walks blamelessly and does what is right.
He who speaks honestly in his heart.

###### v3
He does not slander with his tongue.
He does not harm his friend,
nor _bring up_ ^[Literally "lift up"] a disgrace against his neighbor.

###### v4
In his eyes a rejected one _is_ contemptible,
but he honors those who respect Yahweh.
He takes an oath to _his own_ injury and does not retract it.

###### v5
He does not lend his money at interest,
and does not take a bribe against _the_ innocent.
He who does these _things_
will never be shaken.
