###### v1
Protect me, O God,
for I take refuge in you.

###### v2
_Oh my soul_ you have said ^[Reading a feminine singular verb; some Hebrew manuscripts and translations read "I said"] to Yahweh, "You _are_ my Lord.
I have no good apart from you."

###### v3
With regard to _the_ saints who _are_ in the land,
they _are the_ noble ones in _whom is_ all my desire.

###### v4
Those _who_ hurry _after_ ^[Or "they who acquire"] another _god_ increase their sorrows.
I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood,
nor take up their names on my lips.

###### v5
Yahweh _is_ the portion _which is_ my share and my cup.
You hold my lot.

###### v6
_The_ measuring lines have fallen for me in pleasant places.
Yes, _my_ inheritance is delightful for me.

###### v7
I will bless Yahweh who advises me;
yes, _at_ night my _innermost being_ ^[Literally "kidneys"] instructs me.

###### v8
I have set Yahweh before me always.
Because _he is_ at my right hand I will not be shaken.

###### v9
Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices.
Yes, my body will dwell in safety,

###### v10
for you will not abandon my soul to Sheol;
you will not give your faithful one to see _the_ grave.

###### v11
You will make known to me _the_ path of life.
In your presence _is_ fullness of joy.
At your right hand _are_ pleasures forever.
