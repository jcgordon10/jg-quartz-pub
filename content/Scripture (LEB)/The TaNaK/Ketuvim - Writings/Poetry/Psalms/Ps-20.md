###### v1
May Yahweh answer you in _the_ day of trouble.
May the name of Jacob's God protect ^[The sense is that of making something inaccessibly high, like a fortress] you.

###### v2
May he send you help ^[Hebrew "your help"] from _the_ sanctuary,
and from Zion may he sustain you.

###### v3
May he remember all your offerings,
and your burnt offering may he _regard favorably_. ^[Literally "find _to be_ fat"]

###### v4
May he give to you _your heart's desire_, ^[Literally "according to your heart"]
and your every plan may he fulfill. _Selah_

###### v5
May we shout for joy over your victory,
and in the name of our God may we set up banners.
May Yahweh fulfill all your requests.

###### v6
Now I know that Yahweh will help his anointed. ^[Hebrew "messiah"]
He will answer him from his holy heaven
with the victorious power of his right hand.

###### v7
_Some boast in chariots and others in horses_, ^[Literally "These in the chariots and those in the horses"]
but we boast in the name of Yahweh, our God.

###### v8
They will collapse and fall,
and we will rise and stand firm.

###### v9
Rescue, ^[Or "Grant victory"] O Yahweh.
Let the king answer us when we call.
