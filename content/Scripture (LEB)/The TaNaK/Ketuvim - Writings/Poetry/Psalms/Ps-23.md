###### v1
Yahweh is my shepherd;
I will not lack _for anything_.

###### v2
In grassy pastures he makes me lie down;
by quiet waters he leads me.

###### v3
He restores my life. ^[Or "my soul"]
He leads me in _correct paths_ ^[Literally "paths of righteousness"]
for the sake of his name.

###### v4
Even when I walk in a dark valley, I fear no evil
because you _are_ with me.
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

###### v5
You prepare before me a table
in the presence of my oppressors.
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup _is_ overflowing.

###### v6
Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue me
all the days of my life,
and I will stay ^[Hebrew "return"] in the house ^[Or "temple"] of Yahweh
_for a very long time_. ^[Literally "for length of days"]
