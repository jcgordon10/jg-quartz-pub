and has established it on _the_ rivers.

###### v3
Who may ascend _the_ mountain of Yahweh?
And who may stand in his holy place?

###### v4
He who is innocent of hands and pure of heart,

and does not swear deceitfully.

He will receive blessing from Yahweh,
and justice ^[Or "vindication"] from the God of his salvation.

Such _is the_ sort of those who seek ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere)_] him,
those who seek your face, even Jacob. _Selah_

Lift up your heads, O gates,
and rise up, O ancient doorways,

Who _is_ the king of glory? ^[Literally "the king of the glory"]
Yahweh, strong and mighty;
Yahweh, mighty in war!

that the king of glory ^[Literally "the king of the glory"] may enter.

Yahweh of hosts,
He _is_ the king of glory! ^[Literally "the king of the glory"] _Selah_
