###### v1
Judge me, O Yahweh, because I have walked in my integrity,
and I have trusted Yahweh and not wavered.

###### v2
Prove me, O Yahweh, and test me.
Try my _innermost being_ ^[Literally "kidneys," the locus of intense thoughts and emotions in biblical Hebrew] and my _mind_. ^[Literally "heart"]

###### v3
Because your loyal love _is_ before my eyes,
and I walk about in your faithfulness.

###### v4
I do not sit with deceitful people,
nor will I go about with hypocrites.

###### v5
I hate _the_ crowd of evildoers,
and with _the_ wicked I will not sit.

###### v6
I will wash my hands in innocence,
and I will walk about your altar, O Yahweh,

###### v7
to declare with a voice of thanksgiving,
and tell of all your wondrous deeds.

###### v8
O Yahweh, I love _the_ dwelling of your house, ^[Or "temple"]
and _the place where your glory abides_. ^[Literally "the place of the dwelling place of your glory"]

###### v9
Do not destroy me ^[Or "gather my soul _for judgment_"] with _the_ sinners,
nor my life with men of bloodshed,

###### v10
in whose hands _is_ an evil plan,
and whose right hand is full of bribes. ^[Hebrew "bribe"]

###### v11
But as for me, I will walk in my integrity.
Redeem me and be gracious to me.

###### v12
My foot stands on level ground.
In assemblies I will bless Yahweh.
