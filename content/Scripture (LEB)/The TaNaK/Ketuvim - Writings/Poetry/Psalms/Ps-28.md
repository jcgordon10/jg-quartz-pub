###### v1
To you, O Yahweh, I call.
O my rock, do not be deaf to me.
Or else, if you are silent to me,
then I will become like those descending to _the_ pit.

###### v2
Hear the voice of my supplications
when I cry to you for help,
when I lift up my hands
toward your holy inner sanctuary.

###### v3
Do not drag me away with _the_ wicked
or with _the_ workers of evil,
_who_ speak of peace with their neighbors,
while evil _is_ in their heart.

###### v4
Give to them according to their work,
even according to the evil of their deeds.
Give to them according to the work of their hands;
repay them their rightful due.

###### v5
Because they do not regard the works of Yahweh,
nor the work of his hands,
he will destroy them
and not rebuild them.

###### v6
Blessed _is_ Yahweh,
because he has heard the voice of my supplications.

###### v7
Yahweh _is_ my strength and my shield.
My heart trusts him and I am helped.
So my heart rejoices,
and with my song I will give thanks to him.

###### v8
Yahweh _is_ their strength,
and he _is_ the refuge for the salvation of his anointed one.

###### v9
Save your people
and bless your heritage.
Shepherd them also and carry them always.
