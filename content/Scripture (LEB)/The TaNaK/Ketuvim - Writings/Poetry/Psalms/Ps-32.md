###### v1
Happy _is_ he whose transgression is taken away,
whose sin is covered.

###### v2
Happy _is_ a person to whom Yahweh does not impute iniquity
and in whose spirit there is not deceit.

###### v3
When I kept silent, my bones were worn out
due to my groaning all the day.

###### v4
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
My vigor was changed into _the_ dry heat of summer. _Selah_

###### v5
I made known my sin to you, and my iniquity I did not cover.
I said, "I will confess concerning my transgressions to Yahweh,"
and you took away the guilt of my sin. _Selah_

###### v6
Therefore let all _the_ faithful pray to you
at _the_ time _for_ finding _you_.
Surely at _the_ flood of many waters they will not reach him.

###### v7
You _are_ my hiding place;
from trouble you preserve me.
_With_ cries of deliverance you surround me. _Selah_

###### v8
I ^[Yahweh is speaking in vv. [[Ps-32#v8|8–9]][[Ps-32#v9|]]] will instruct you and teach you
in _the_ way that you should go.
I will advise _you_ _with_ my eye upon you.

###### v9
Do not be like a horse _or_ like a mule, without understanding;
_that needs_ his tackle--bridle and rein--for restraint
_or he would not_ come near you.

###### v10
Many are _the_ pains of the wicked,
but _for_ the one who trusts Yahweh
loyal love surrounds him.

###### v11
Be glad in Yahweh and rejoice, _you_ righteous,
and shout for joy, all _you_ upright of heart.
