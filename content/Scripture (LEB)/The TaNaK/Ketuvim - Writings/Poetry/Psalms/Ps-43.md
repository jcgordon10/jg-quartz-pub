###### v1
Judge me, O God, and plead my case
against ^[Or "because of"] an unfaithful ^[Or "disloyal"] nation.
From a man of deceit and wickedness rescue me,

###### v2
because you _are_ the God of my refuge.
Why have you rejected me?
Why must I go about mourning
because of _the_ oppression of _the_ enemy?

###### v3
Send your light and your truth;
they shall lead ^[Or "let them lead"] me.
They shall bring me to _your holy mountain_ ^[Literally "the mountain of your holiness"]
and to your dwelling places.

###### v4
Then ^[Or "And"] I will go to the altar of God,
to God, _my surpassing joy_, ^[Literally "the joy of my gladness"]
and I will praise you with lyre,
O God, my God.

###### v5
Why are you _in despair_, ^[Literally "bowed down"] O my soul?
And why are you disturbed within me?
Hope in God, because I will again praise him,
_my salvation_ ^[Hebrew "the salvation of my face"] and my God.
