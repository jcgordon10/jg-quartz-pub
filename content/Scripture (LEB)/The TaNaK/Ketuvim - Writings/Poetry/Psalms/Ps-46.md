though its waters roar _and_ foam,
though mountains shake with its surging _water_. _Selah_

###### v4
_There is_ a river whose streams gladden the city of God,
the holiest of the dwellings of the Most High.

###### v5
God _is_ in the midst of her;
she will not be made to totter.
God will help her _at daybreak_. ^[Literally "at the turning of the morning"]

Nations roar, kingdoms shake;
he utters his voice, _the_ earth melts.

Come, see the works of Yahweh,

Be still, and know that I _am_ God.
I will be exalted among the nations;
I will be exalted in the earth.
