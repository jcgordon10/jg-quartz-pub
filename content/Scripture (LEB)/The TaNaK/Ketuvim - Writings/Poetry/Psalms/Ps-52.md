[[Ps-51|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-53|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Why do you boast about evil, O mighty man?
The loyal love of God _endures_ _continually_. ^[Literally "all the day"]

###### v2
Your tongue plans destruction,
like a sharp razor, working deceit.

###### v3
You love evil more than good,
a lie more than speaking _what is right_. ^[Literally "righteousness"] _Selah_

###### v4
You love all devouring words,
O deceitful tongue,

###### v5
but God will pull you down forever.
He will snatch you and tear you away from _your_ tent,
and _he_ will uproot you from _the_ land of _the_ living. _Selah_

###### v6
And _the_ righteous will see and fear,
and will laugh at him, _saying_,

###### v7
"Look, the man _who_ would not make God his refuge,
but he trusted in the greatness of his wealth;
he took refuge in his destructiveness."

###### v8
But I _am_ like an olive tree flourishing
in the house ^[Or "temple"] of God.
I trust the loyal love of God forever and ever.

###### v9
I will give thanks to you forever, because _of what_ you have done,
and I will wait on your name, because _it is_ good,
in the presence of your faithful ones.
