[[Ps-52|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-54|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
_The_ fool says in his heart, "There is no God."
They are corrupt and they have done abominable iniquity.
There is none who does good.

###### v2
God looks down from heaven upon the children of humankind
to see whether there is one who has insight,
one who seeks God.

###### v3
_All of them_ ^[Literally "The whole of it," i.e. all of humankind] have turned back.
They are altogether corrupt.
There is none who does good;
there is not even one.

###### v4
Do not evildoers know,
_they_ who eat my people _as though_ they were eating bread?
They do not call on God.

###### v5
There _they are very fearful_ ^[Literally "they feared a fear"]
_where_ no fear had been,
because God has scattered the bones of him who encamps _against_ you.
You have put _them_ to shame, because God has rejected them.

###### v6
_Oh, that from Zion_ ^[Literally "Who will give _that_ from Zion"] would come salvation _for_ Israel!
When God returns the fortunes ^[Or "captivity"] of his people,
let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
