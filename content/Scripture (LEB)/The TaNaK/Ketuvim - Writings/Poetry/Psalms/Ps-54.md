###### v1
O God, by your name save me,
and by your power vindicate me.

###### v2
O God, hear my prayer;
heed the words of my mouth.

###### v3
For foreigners have risen against me,
and ruthless _men_ seek my life.
They have not set God before them. _Selah_

###### v4
See, God _is_ my helper;
The Lord _is_ with those who sustain my life. ^[Or "The Lord _is_ the sustainer of my life."]

###### v5
He will repay ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] my enemies for their ^[Hebrew "the"] evil;
in your faithfulness destroy them.

###### v6
I will freely sacrifice to you;
I will give thanks _to_ your name,
O Yahweh, because _it is_ good.

###### v7
Because he has delivered me from all trouble,
and my eye has looked _with satisfaction_ on my enemies.
