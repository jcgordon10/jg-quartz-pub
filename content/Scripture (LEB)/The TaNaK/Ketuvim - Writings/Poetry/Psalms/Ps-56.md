###### v1
Be gracious to me, O God, because humankind has trampled me;
fighting all the day he oppresses me.

###### v2
My enemies ^[Or "lurking foes"] trample all day,
because many _are_ attacking me proudly.

###### v3
_When_ ^[Literally "_The_ day"] I fear, I trust you.

###### v4
God, whose word I praise,
God I trust; I do not fear.
What can _mere_ flesh do to me?

###### v5
All day they twist my words;
all their thoughts _are_ against me for evil.

###### v6
They attack, ^[Or "they stir up strife"] they hide, they watch my _steps_, ^[Literally "heels"]
as they _lie in_ wait for my life.

###### v7
Because of iniquity will they escape?
In anger cast down _the_ peoples, O God.

###### v8
You have kept count of my wonderings.
Put my tears in your bottle;
_are they_ not in your book?

###### v9
Then my enemies will turn back _when_ ^[Literally "in the day"] I call. ^[i.e., call on God]
This I know because ^[Or "that"] God _is_ for me.

###### v10
God, _whose_ word I praise,
Yahweh, _whose_ word I praise,

###### v11
God I trust; I do not fear.
What can _mere_ humankind do to me?

###### v12
_My_ vows _to you_, O God, _are binding_ upon me.
I will pay thank offerings to you,

###### v13
because you have delivered my soul from death.
_Have you_ not _kept_ my feet from stumbling,
that I may walk before God
in the light of the living?
