###### v1
Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me,
because in you my soul takes refuge.
In the shadow of your wings I will take refuge
until destruction passes by.

###### v2
I will call to God Most High,
to God who accomplishes _things_ concerning me.

###### v3
He will send from heaven and save me;
he will reproach _the_ one who tramples me. _Selah_
God will send his loyal love and his faithfulness.

###### v4
My soul _is_ among lions.
I lie down _among those who_ devour--
the children ^[Or "sons"] of humankind whose teeth _are_ spears and arrows
and whose tongues _are_ sharp swords.

###### v5
Be exalted above the heavens, O God.
_Let_ your glory _be_ above all the earth.

###### v6
They have set a net for my steps;
my soul is bowed down.
They have dug a pit before me;
they have fallen into the midst of it. _Selah_

###### v7
My heart _is_ steadfast, O God;
My heart _is_ steadfast.
I will sing and give praise.

###### v8
Awake, my glory;
Awake, harp and lyre.
I will awake _the_ dawn. ^[Or "_at_ dawn"]

###### v9
I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Lord;
I will give you praise among _the_ nations.

###### v10
Because your loyal love _is_ high to _the_ heavens,
and your faithfulness to _the_ clouds.

###### v11
Be exalted above _the_ heavens, O God.
_Let_ your glory _be_ above all the earth.
