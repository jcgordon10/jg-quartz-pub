[[Ps-59|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ps-61|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
O God, you have rejected us. You have broken us.
You have been angry. Restore us!

###### v2
You have made _the_ land quake. You have split it open.
Heal its fissures, because it totters.

###### v3
You have shown your people hard _things_;
You have given us wine that staggers.

###### v4
You have rallied those who fear you round a banner
_out of bowshot_, ^[Literally "from _the_ presence of _the_ bow"] _Selah_

###### v5
so that your beloved ones may be rescued.
Save by your right hand and answer us.

###### v6
God has spoken in his holiness,
"I will rejoice;
I will divide up Shechem,
and portion out the valley of Succoth.

###### v7
Gilead _is_ mine, and Manasseh _is_ mine,
and Ephraim _is_ the _helmet for_ ^[Literally "protection of"] my head;
Judah _is_ my scepter. ^[Or "commander's rod"]

###### v8
Moab _is_ my washing pot;
over Edom, I will cast my sandal.
On account of me, O Philistia, raise a shout."

###### v9
Who will bring me to _the_ fortified city?
Who will lead me to Edom?

###### v10
Have not you yourself rejected us, O God,
and not gone out with our armies, O God?

###### v11
Give us help against _the_ adversary,
for the help of humankind _is_ futile.

###### v12
Through God we will do _valiantly_, ^[Literally "might"]
and _it is_ he _who_ will tread down our enemies.
