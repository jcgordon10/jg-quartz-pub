###### v1
Hear, O God, my cry;
attend to my prayer.

###### v2
From the end of the earth ^[Or "the far reaches of the land"] I call to you
when my heart grows faint.
You will lead me to a rock _that is_ higher than I.

###### v3
For you have been my refuge,
a strong tower from the enemy.

###### v4
Let me reside in your tent forever.
Let me take refuge under the covering of your wings. _Selah_

###### v5
For you, O God, you have heard my vows.
You have given _me_ the heritage of those who fear your name.

###### v6
You will add days to the days of the king,
his years like _those of_ _many generations_. ^[Literally "a generation and a generation"]

###### v7
May he live ^[Or "be enthroned"] forever in the presence of God.
Appoint loyal love and faithfulness to preserve him.

###### v8
So I will sing the praise of your name forever,
that I may fulfill ^[Or "pay"] my vows _daily_. ^[Literally "day, day"]
