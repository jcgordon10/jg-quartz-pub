###### v1
O God, you _are_ my God;
I will seek you diligently.
My soul thirsts for you; my flesh longs for you
_as_ in a dry and weary land without water.

###### v2
Thus I have seen you in the sanctuary,
beholding your strength and glory.

###### v3
Because your loyal love _is_ better than life,
my lips will praise you.

###### v4
So I will bless you while I live.
I will lift up my _hands_ ^[Hebrew "palms"] in your name.

###### v5
My soul will be satisfied _as with the_ best and richest _food_,
and _with_ joyful lips my mouth will praise.

###### v6
When I remember you on my bed,
I meditate on you in _the_ night watches.

###### v7
Because you have been my help,
therefore ^[Hebrew "and"] in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.

###### v8
My soul clings to ^[Or "follows hard after"] you;
your right hand upholds me.

###### v9
But as for them _who_ seek my life for ruin,
they will go into the depths of the earth.

###### v10
They _who_ would _deliver him to the sword_ ^[Literally "pour him out to the hands of the sword"]
will become a portion for jackals.

###### v11
However, the king will rejoice in God.
Everyone who swears an oath by him will boast,
because _the_ mouth of _the_ liars will be stopped.
