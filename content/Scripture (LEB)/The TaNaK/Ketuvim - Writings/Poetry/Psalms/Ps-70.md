###### v1
O God, _make haste_ to deliver me.
O Yahweh, make haste to help me.

###### v2
Let them be ashamed and abashed
who seek my life.
Let them be repulsed and humiliated
_who_ desire my harm.

###### v3
let them turn back because of their shame,
those who say, "Aha! Aha!"

###### v4
Let them rejoice and be glad in you,
all those who seek you.
Let them say continually, "God is great!"
_those_ who love your salvation.

###### v5
But I _am_ poor and needy;
O God hasten to me.
You _are_ my help and my deliverer.
O Yahweh, do not delay.
