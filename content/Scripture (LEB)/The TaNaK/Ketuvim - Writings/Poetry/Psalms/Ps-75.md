###### v1
We give thanks to you, O God;
we give thanks, and your name is near.
Your wonderful deeds are told. ^[Hebrew "They tell your wonderful deeds"]

###### v2
"I will indeed set an appointed time;
I will judge fairly. ^[Hebrew "I, I will judge" might be emphatic]

###### v3
_The_ earth and all its inhabitants _are_ shaking; ^[Or "melting away"]
I steady ^[Hebrew "I, I steady" might be emphatic] its columns. _Selah_

###### v4
I say to the boastful, 'Do not boast!'
and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up _your_ horn!

###### v5
Do not lift up high your ^[Plural] horn.
Do _not_ speak with _arrogant pride_.'" ^[Hebrew "an unrestrained neck"]

###### v6
For _it is_ not from _the_ east or _the_ west
and not from _the_ south ^[Hebrew "wilderness"] _that_ lifting up _comes_,

###### v7
rather God _is the_ judge;
one he brings low, and another he lifts up.

###### v8
For _there is_ a cup in the hand of Yahweh
with ^[Hebrew "and"] wine _that_ foams, fully mixed,
and he pours out from this.
Surely all _the_ wicked of _the_ land
_will quaff it down _to_ its dregs_.  ^[Literally "they will drain, they will drink its dregs"]

###### v9
But as for me, I will proclaim forever;
I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.

###### v10
"And all _the_ horns of _the_ wicked I will cut off.
_The_ horns of _the_ righteous will be lifted up."
