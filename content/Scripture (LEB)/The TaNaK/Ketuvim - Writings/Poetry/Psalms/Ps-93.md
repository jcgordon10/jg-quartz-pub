###### v1
Yahweh is king; he clothes himself with majesty.
Yahweh clothes himself; he girds himself with might.
Yes, _the_ world is established _so that_ it will not be moved.

###### v2
Your throne _is_ established from of old;
you _are_ from everlasting.

###### v3
_The_ rivers have lifted up, O Yahweh;
_the_ rivers have lifted up their _rumbling_; ^[Literally "voice"]
_the_ rivers have lifted up their pounding.

###### v4
_Mightier_ than the rumblings of many waters,
_mightier_ than _the_ mighty breakers of _the_ sea,
Yahweh on high _is_ mighty.

###### v5
Your testimonies are fully reliable.
Holiness is fitting for your house, ^[Or "temple"]
O Yahweh, _forever_. ^[Literally "for a length of days"]
