###### v1
Come, let us sing for joy to Yahweh;
let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.

###### v2
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving;
with songs let us shout joyfully to him.

###### v3
For Yahweh _is_ _the_ ^[The Hebrew does not have the definite article used twice in the translation of this verse] great God,
and _the_ great king over all gods,

###### v4
in whose hand _are the_ unexplored places ^[Or "the deep places"] of _the_ earth,
and _the_ heights of _the_ mountains _are_ his,

###### v5
to whom belongs the sea that he made,  ^[Hebrew "and he made it"]
and _the_ dry land _that_ his hands formed.

###### v6
Come in, let us worship and bow down;
let us kneel before Yahweh, our maker.

###### v7
For he _is_ our God,
and we _are_ the people of his pasture
and the sheep of his hand.
_Today_ ^[Literally "The day"] if you will hear his voice: ^[Or "If only you would hear his voice today"]

###### v8
"Do not harden your heart as _at_ Meribah,
as _in_ the day of Massah in the wilderness,

###### v9
when your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] tried me.
They put me to the test,
_even_ though they had seen my work.

###### v10
For forty years I loathed _that_ generation,
and said, '_They are_ a people _whose_ heart wanders.
And my ways they do not know.'

###### v11
Therefore I swore in my anger,
'They shall surely not enter into my rest.'"
