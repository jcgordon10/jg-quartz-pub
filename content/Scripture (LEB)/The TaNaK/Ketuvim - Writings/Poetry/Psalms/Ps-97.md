Yahweh is king! Let the earth rejoice;
let many coastlands be glad.

###### v2
Cloud and thick darkness _are_ surrounding him;
righteousness and justice _are_ the foundation of his throne.

###### v3
Fire goes before him,
and devours his enemies round about.

###### v4
His lightnings light _the_ world;
the earth sees and trembles.

###### v5
_The_ mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh,
at the presence of the Lord of all the earth.

###### v6
The heavens declare his righteousness,
and all the peoples see his glory.

###### v7
Let all who serve an image be ashamed,
those who boast about idols. ^[This word for idols suggests something worthless or insignificant]
Worship him, all you gods.

###### v8
Zion hears and is glad,
and the daughters of Judah rejoice
because of your judgments, O Yahweh.

###### v9
For you, O Yahweh, _are_ most high over all the earth.
You are highly ^[Hebrew "very"] exalted above all gods.

You who love Yahweh, hate evil.
He protects the lives of his faithful;
he delivers them from _the_ hand of _the_ wicked.

###### v11
Light _is_ sown for the righteous,
and joy for _the_ upright in heart.

###### v12
Be glad in Yahweh, _you_ righteous,
and give thanks _to his holy name_. ^[Literally "to his holy remembrance" or "to his memorable holiness"]
