###### v1
Yahweh is king; let _the_ peoples tremble.
_He_ sits enthroned ^[Or "dwells"] _between the_ cherubim. Let the earth shake.

###### v2
Yahweh _is_ great in Zion,
and he _is_ exalted over all the peoples.

###### v3
Let them praise your great and fearful name.
He _is_ holy.

###### v4
And _the_ strength of _the_ king loves justice. ^[The interpretation of this line is uncertain]
You have established equity;
you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.

###### v5
Exalt Yahweh our God,
and worship at his footstool.
He _is_ holy.

###### v6
Moses and Aaron _were_ among his priests;
Samuel also _was_ among _those who_ called on his name.
They called to Yahweh, and he answered them.

###### v7
He spoke to them in _the_ pillar of cloud.
They kept his testimonies and _the_ statute he gave to them.

###### v8
O Yahweh our God, you answered them.
You were a forgiving God to them,
but an avenger of their _wrong_ deeds.

###### v9
Exalt Yahweh our God,
and worship at his holy mountain,
for Yahweh our God _is_ holy.
