[[Josh-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
After the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh, Yahweh said to Joshua son of Nun, the assistant ^[Or "servant"] of Moses, saying,

###### v2
"My servant Moses _is_ dead. Get up and cross the Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I _am_ giving to them, to the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v3
Every place that the soles of your feet will tread, I have given it to you, as I promised ^[Or "spoke"] to Moses.

###### v4
From the wilderness _and the Lebanon_, ^[Literally "this Lebanon"; "Lebanon" in Hebrew means "white mountain"] up to the great river, the river Euphrates, all of the land of the Hittites, and up to _the great sea in the west_, ^[Literally "the great sea of the setting sun"] will be your territory.

###### v5
No one will stand before you ^[Or "in your presence"] all the days of your life. _Just_ as I was with Moses, _so_ will I be with you; I will not fail you, and I will not forsake you.

###### v6
Be strong and courageous, for you will give the people this land as an inheritance that I swore to their ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] to give them.

###### v7
Only be strong and very courageous _to observe diligently the whole law_ ^[Literally "to keep _and_ to act according to the whole law"] that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn aside from it, _to_ the right or left, so that you may succeed _wherever you go_. ^[Literally "in all that you go"]

###### v8
The scroll of this law will not depart from your mouth; you will meditate on it day and night so that _you may observe diligently all that is written_ ^[Literally "to keep _and_ to act according to all that is written"] in it. For then you will succeed _in_ your ways and prosper.

###### v9
Did I not command you? Be strong and courageous! Do not fear or be dismayed, for Yahweh your God is with you _wherever you go_." ^[Literally "in all that you go"]

###### v10
Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

###### v11
"Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people: 'Prepare your provisions; ^[Hebrew "provision"] _in_ ^[Literally "for in still"] three days you _are to_ cross the Jordan to go possess the land that Yahweh your God _is_ giving you to possess.'"

###### v12
To the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,

###### v13
"Remember the word that Moses Yahweh's servant commanded you, saying, 'Yahweh your God _is_ giving rest to you, and he is giving ^[Hebrew "he gave"] you this land.'

###### v14
Your wives, your little children, and your livestock, they will remain in the land that Moses gave to you beyond the Jordan. _All of the best fighting men_ ^[Literally "All the mighty warriors of the troop"] will cross armed in front of your families; they will help you

###### v15
until Yahweh gives rest to your families as well as to you. They will take possession of the land that Yahweh your God _is_ giving to them. Then you will return to your own land and take possession of it, _the land_ that Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan _to the east_." ^[Literally "to the sunrise"]

###### v16
And they answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you will send us we will go.

###### v17
Just as we obeyed Moses, so will we obey you. Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.

###### v18
Whoever _rebels against your orders_ ^[Literally "defiles against your mouth"] and does not obey your words according to what you commanded us will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous."
