###### v1
Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two men from Acacia Grove ^[Hebrew "Shittim"] _as_ spies, saying, "Go, view the land, especially Jericho." So they went, and entered the house of a prostitute whose name _was_ Rahab, and _spent the night_ ^[Literally "lay down"] there.

###### v2
The king of Jericho was told, "Look, _some_ men from the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] have come here tonight to search out the land."

###### v3
And the king of Jericho sent _for_ Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men who came to you, the ones who have entered your house, for they have come to search out the whole land."

###### v4
But the woman took the two men and hid them. And she said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they _were_ from.

###### v5
And when _it was time_ to shut the gate _for the night_, ^[Literally "in the darkness" or "at dark"] the men left, and I do not know where they went. Chase after them quickly, for you may catch up _to_ them."

###### v6
(But she had taken them to the roof and had hidden them _in the stalks of flax_ ^[Literally "in the flaxes of the plant stalk"] that she _had spread out_ ^[Literally "had been arranged"] on the roof.)

###### v7
So the men chased after them on _the way to the Jordan_ ^[Literally "the road of the Jordan"] at the fords; and they shut the gate behind the pursuers that had gone out after them.

###### v8
Before _they went to sleep_, ^[Literally "they lay down"] she came up to them on the roof

###### v9
and said to the men, "I know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away _in fear_ because of your presence.

###### v10
For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the waters of the _Red Sea_ ^[Literally "sea of reeds"] before you when you went out from Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that _were_ beyond the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.

###### v11
We heard _this_, and our hearts ^[Hebrew "heart"] melted, and _no courage was left in anyone_ ^[Literally "a spirit no longer stood in anyone"] because of your presence. For Yahweh your God _is_ God in the heavens above and on the earth below.

###### v12
So then please swear to me by Yahweh, because _I have shown loyalty to you_, ^[Literally "I have done with you a loyal love"] and _you will also show loyalty_ ^[Literally "you will do … loyal love"] _to my family_. ^[Literally "with the house of my father"] You must give me a sign of good faith, ^[Or "faithfulness"]

###### v13
and you will spare my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all that belongs to them; you will deliver our lives from death."

###### v14
And the men said to her, "_Our lives for yours_. ^[Literally "Our lives in place of yours to die"] If you do not report this business of ours, _we will show you loyalty and faithfulness_ ^[Literally "we will do with you loyal love and faithfulness"] when Yahweh gives us the land."

###### v15
Then she lowered them with a rope through the window, as her house _was_ on the outer side of the wall, and she _was_ residing in the wall.

###### v16
And she said to them, "Go to the mountain, so that the pursuers will not find you, and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers return, and afterward you may go _on your way_." ^[Literally "to your way"]

###### v17
The men said to her, "We _will be_ released from this oath of yours that you made us swear.

###### v18
_When_ we come to the land, you must tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and you must gather your father and mother, and your brothers, and your whole family to your house.

###### v19
If anyone goes outside the doors of your house, _they will be responsible for their own death_, ^[Literally "his blood _will be_ on his head"] and we _will be_ innocent. Anyone who will be with you in the house, _we will be responsible for their death_ ^[Literally "his blood _will be_ on our head"] _if a hand is laid on them_. ^[Literally "if a hand will be against him"]

###### v20
But if you report this business of ours, we will be released from your oath that you made us swear."

###### v21
And she said, "According to your word it _will be_." Then she sent them away, and they went, and she tied the scarlet cord in the window.

###### v22
They departed and came to the mountain, and they stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers searched _all along the way_ ^[Literally "on all of the road"] but did not find _them_.

###### v23
The two men returned and went down from the mountain, and they crossed _over_ and came to Joshua son of Nun, and they told him everything that happened to them.

###### v24
They said to Joshua, "Surely Yahweh has given all the land into our hand; also, all the inhabitants of the land melt away _in fear_ because of our presence."
