###### v1
Joshua rose early in the morning, and they set out from Acacia Grove. ^[Hebrew "Shittim"] And they came up to the Jordan, he and all the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and they spent the night there before they crossed _over_.

###### v2
At the end of the three days the officers passed through the midst of the camp,

###### v3
and they commanded the people: "When you see the Levitical priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God you must set out from your place and go after it.

###### v4
_But_ there will be a distance between you and it of about two thousand cubits in measurement. ^[That is, about 1 km] Do not come near it, so that you may know the way that you must go, for you have not passed on _this_ way _before_." ^[Literally "from yesterday three days before"]

###### v5
And Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves, because tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders in your midst."

###### v6
And Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant and cross _over_ _ahead of the people_." ^[Literally "before the presence of the people"] And they took up the ark of the covenant and went _ahead of the people_. ^[Literally "before the presence of the people"]

###### v7
Then Yahweh said to Joshua, "This day I will begin exalting you _in the sight_ ^[Literally "in the eyes"] of all Israel, that they may know that I was with Moses, and I will be with you.

###### v8
You will command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, 'At the moment that you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you will stand _still_ in the Jordan.'"

###### v9
And Joshua said to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] "Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your God."

###### v10
Joshua said, "By this you will know that _the_ living God _is_ in your midst, and he will certainly drive out the Canaanites _from before you_, ^[Or "from your presence"] and the Hittites, Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites.

###### v11
Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth ^[Or "world"] _is about to_ cross _over_ ahead of you into the Jordan.

###### v12
So then, take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, _one from each tribe_. ^[Literally "one man for the tribe"]

###### v13
When the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the ark of Yahweh, Lord of all the earth, ^[Or "world"] rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off _upstream_, ^[Literally "going down from above"] and they will stand _still in_ one heap.

###### v14
And it happened, when the people set out from their tents to cross _over_ the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant were _ahead of the people_. ^[Literally "before the presence of the people"]

###### v15
When those carrying the ark came up to the Jordan, and the priests carrying the ark dipped their feet in the edge of the water (the Jordan was flowing over its banks during all the days of harvest),

###### v16
the waters flowing down from above stood _still_; they stood up _in_ one heap very far from Adam, the city that _is_ beside Zarethan, while _the waters_ flowing down to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, ^[That is, the Dead Sea] _were completely cut off_; ^[Literally "they were completed they were cut off"] and the people crossed _over_ opposite Jericho.

###### v17
And the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh stood firmly on the dry land in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until all the nation finished crossing the Jordan.
