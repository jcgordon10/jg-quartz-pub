###### v1
After all the nation finished crossing the Jordan, Yahweh said to Joshua,

###### v2
"Take twelve men from the people, _one man from each tribe_, ^[Literally "man one man one from tribe"]

###### v3
and command them, saying, 'Take for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests' feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you, and set them up in _the place where you will camp tonight_.'" ^[Literally "the lodging place where you will lodge tonight"]

###### v4
So Joshua summoned the twelve men whom he had appointed from the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] one from each tribe.

###### v5
And Joshua said to them, "Cross _over_ before ^[Or "the presence"] the ark of Yahweh your God to the middle of the Jordan, and each one of you lift up a stone on your ^[Hebrew "his"] shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v6
so that this may be a reminder ^[Or "sign"] among you. When your children ask in the future, saying, '_What do these stones mean to you_?' ^[Literally "What are these stones for you?"]

###### v7
you will say to them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off _from before_ ^[Or "the presence of"] the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones will be as a memorial for the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] for eternity."

###### v8
Thus the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did as Joshua commanded. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan as Yahweh told Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and they carried them over with them to _the camp_, ^[Literally "the place of overnight lodging"] and they put them there.

###### v9
Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests carrying the ark of the covenant _stood_, and they are there to this day.

###### v10
The priests carrying the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything that Yahweh commanded Joshua to tell the people was finished, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hastily crossed _over_.

###### v11
And it happened, when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of Yahweh and the priests crossed _over_ in front of ^[Or "before the presence"] the people.

###### v12
The children of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed _over_ armed before the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] as Moses told them.

###### v13
About forty thousand armed for fighting crossed _over_ before the presence of Yahweh to the plains of Jericho for battle.

###### v14
On that day Yahweh exalted Joshua _in the sight_ ^[Literally "in the eyes"] of all Israel, and they respected him ^[Or "feared him"] as they respected ^[Or "feared"] Moses all the days of his life.

###### v15
Then Yahweh said to Joshua, saying,

###### v16
"Command the priests carrying the ark of the testimony ^[That is, the ark of the covenant] _to come up_ ^[Literally "and let them come up"] from the Jordan."

###### v17
So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, "Come up from the Jordan."

###### v18
And it happened that when the priests carrying the ark came up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet _touched dry land_, ^[Literally "were raised from the ground to dry land"] the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and flowed over all its banks as before.

###### v19
And the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth _day_ of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the eastern edge ^[That is, border] of Jericho.

###### v20
And those twelve stones that they took from the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.

###### v21
And he said to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] "When your children ask in the future _their parents_, ^[Literally "their fathers"] '_What is the meaning of these stones_?' ^[Literally "What _are_ these stones?"]

###### v22
you will let your children know _by_ saying, 'Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.'

###### v23
For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you, until you had crossed, just as Yahweh your God did to the _Red Sea_, ^[Literally "sea of reeds"] which he dried up before us until we had crossed over,

###### v24
so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of Yahweh _is_ strong, so that you may fear Yahweh your God _forever_." ^[Literally "all the days"]
