###### v1
And it happened, when all the kings of the Amorites who _were_ beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] who _were_ by the sea heard that Yahweh dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] until they crossed _over_, their hearts melted, and _there was no courage left in them_ ^[Literally "a spirit was no longer in them"] because of the presence of the _Israelites_.  ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v2
At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, "Make for yourself knives of flint, and circumcise the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] a second time."

###### v3
So Joshua made knives of flint, and he circumcised the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] at the hill of the foreskins. ^[Hebrew "Gibeath-haaraloth"]

###### v4
This _is_ the reason why Joshua circumcised all the people: all the males who went out from Egypt, all the warriors, died in the wilderness as they went out from Egypt _on the journey_. ^[Literally "on the road"]

###### v5
For all the people who left were circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness _on the journey_ ^[Literally "on the road"] _after_ they left from Egypt were not circumcised.

###### v6
For forty years the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] traveled in the wilderness until all the nation, the warriors that left Egypt, perished, because they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh. To them Yahweh swore that they would not see the land that he ^[Hebrew "Yahweh"] swore to their ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.

###### v7
And it was their children _whom_ he raised in their place that Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised _on the journey_. ^[Literally "on the road"]

###### v8
And it happened, when all the nation had finished circumcising, they remained where they were in the camp until they recovered.

###### v9
And Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you." Therefore, the name of that place is called Gilgal ^[Hebrew "rolling"] to this day.

###### v10
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] camped at Gilgal, and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, on the plains of Jericho.

###### v11
On the next day after the Passover, on that ^[Literally "this"] very day, they ate from the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and roasted corn.

###### v12
And the manna ceased the day after, when they _started_ eating the produce of the land, and there was no longer manna for the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] They ate from the crop of the land of Canaan in that year.

###### v13
And it happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, _he looked up_, ^[Literally "he lifted up his eyes"] and he saw a man standing _opposite him_ ^[Literally "against him"] _with_ his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said, "Are you with us, or with our adversaries?"

###### v14
And he said, "Neither. I have come now _as_ the commander of Yahweh's army." And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and _he bowed down_ ^[Or "he worshiped"] and said to him, "What _is_ my lord commanding his servant?"

###### v15
The commander of Yahweh's army said to Joshua, "Take off your sandals ^[Hebrew "sandal"] from your feet, ^[Hebrew "foot"] for the place where you _are_ standing _is_ holy." And Joshua did so.
