###### v1
Now Jericho _was_ shut up inside and out because of the presence of the _Israelites_; ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] no one was going out or coming in.

###### v2
And Yahweh said to Joshua, "Look, I am giving Jericho into your hand, its king and the soldiers of the army.

###### v3
You will march around the city, all the warriors circling the city once; you will do so for six days.

###### v4
And seven priests will bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day you will march around the city seven times, and the priests will blow on the trumpets.

###### v5
And when they blow long on the horn of the ram, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people will shout _with_ a great war cry, and the wall of the city will fall flat, ^[Or "in its place"] and _the people will charge, each one straight ahead_." ^[Literally "the people will go up, each before him"]

###### v6
So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry the trumpets of the rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh."

###### v7
And he said ^[Hebrew "they said"] to the people, "Go forward and march around the city, and let the armed _men_ pass before the ark of Yahweh.

###### v8
_And when Joshua spoke_ ^[Literally "And it happened the moment of the saying of Joshua"] to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the presence of Yahweh went forward and they blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed behind them.

###### v9
And the armed _men_ went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they were blowing the trumpets.

###### v10
But Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You will not shout, and you will not let your voice be heard; a word will not go out from your mouth until the day I say to you 'Shout!' Then you will shout."

###### v11
And the ark of Yahweh went around the city, _circling once_, ^[Literally "circling one occurrence"] and they came _into_ the camp and spent the night in the camp.

###### v12
Then Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh.

###### v13
The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of the rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually, and they blew on the trumpets. And the armed _men_ went before them, and _the_ rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh, while the trumpets blew continually.

###### v14
And they marched around the city once on the second day, and they returned _to_ the camp. They did _this_ for six days.

###### v15
Then on the seventh day they rose early at dawn, and they marched around the city in this manner seven times. _It was_ only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.

###### v16
And at the seventh time the priests blew on the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, "Shout! For Yahweh has given you the city.

###### v17
The city and all that is in it will be devoted to Yahweh; only Rahab the prostitute and all who _are_ with her in the house will live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.

###### v18
As for you, keep _away_ from the things ^[Hebrew "thing"] devoted to destruction so that you do not take them and bring about your own destruction, making the camp of Israel an object for destruction, bringing trouble upon it.

###### v19
But all of the silver and gold, and the items of bronze and iron, _are_ holy to Yahweh, and they must go to Yahweh's treasury."

###### v20
So the people shouted, and they ^[That is, the priests] blew on the trumpets. And when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, they raised a great shout, and the wall fell flat. _The people charged, each one straight ahead into the city_, ^[Literally "The people went up, each before him"] and they captured it.

###### v21
And they utterly destroyed _by the edge of the sword_ ^[Literally "by the mouth of _the_ sword"] all who _were_ in the city, both men and women, young and old, ox, sheep, and donkey.

###### v22
Then Joshua said to the two men who spied on the land, "Go _to_ the prostitute's house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, just as you swore to her."

###### v23
So the young men who were spies went and brought Rahab and her father and mother, her brothers, and all who were with her. And they brought all her family out and set them outside the camp of Israel.

###### v24
And they burned the city and all that _was_ in it with fire; they put only the silver and gold, and the items of copper and iron, _into_ the treasury of the house of Yahweh.

###### v25
But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute _and her family_ ^[Literally "and the house of her father"] and all who _were_ with her, and she has lived in the midst of Israel until this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

###### v26
And Joshua swore at that time, saying, "Cursed _is_ anyone before Yahweh who gets up and builds Jericho, this city. At the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates."

###### v27
So Yahweh was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.
