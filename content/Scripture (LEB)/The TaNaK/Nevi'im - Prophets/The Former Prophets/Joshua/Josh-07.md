###### v1
But the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] broke faith concerning the devoted things. ^[Or "consecrated possession_s_"] Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took from the devoted things; ^[Hebrew "thing" or "consecrated possession"] and _Yahweh's anger was kindled_ ^[Literally "the nose of Yahweh became hot"] against the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v2
Now Joshua sent men from Jericho _to_ Ai, which _is_ near Beth Aven, east of Bethel, and he said to them, "Go up and spy out Ai." And the men went up and spied out Ai.

###### v3
And they returned to Joshua and said to him, "Do not let all the people go up and attack Ai; _only_ two or three thousand men should go up because they ^[That is, the people of Ai] _are_ few. Do not make all the people weary _up_ there."

###### v4
So about three thousand from the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.

###### v5
The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, and they chased them from the gate up to Shebarim and killed them on the slope. And the hearts ^[Hebrew "heart"] of the people melted and became like water.

###### v6
And Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads. ^[Hebrew "head"]

###### v7
And Joshua said, "Ah, my Lord! Why did you bring this people across the Jordan to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content and stayed beyond the Jordan.

###### v8
Please, my Lord! What can I say after _Israel has fled from its enemies_? ^[Literally "Israel has turned its neck before its enemies"]

###### v9
The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear _of this_, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the land. What will you do, for your great name?"

###### v10
And Yahweh said to Joshua, "Stand up! _Why_ ^[Literally "For what this"] _have_ you fallen on your face?

###### v11
Israel has sinned and _transgressed my covenant_ ^[Literally "crossed my covenant"] that I commanded them. They have taken from the devoted things; ^[Hebrew "thing" or "from the consecrated possession"] they have stolen and acted deceitfully, and they have put _them_ among their belongings.

###### v12
The _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] were unable to stand before their enemies; _they fled from their enemies_ ^[Literally "they turned _their_ neck before their enemies"] because they have become a thing devoted ^[Or "consecrated"] for destruction. _I will be with you no more_ ^[Literally "I will not do again to be with you"] unless you destroy the devoted things ^[Hebrew "thing" or "consecrated possession"] from among you.

###### v13
Get up, sanctify the people, and say, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow. Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: "_There are_ devoted things ^[Hebrew "thing" or "consecrated possession"] in your midst, O Israel. You will be unable to stand before you enemies until you remove the devoted things ^[Hebrew "thing" or "consecrated possession"] from your midst."

###### v14
In the morning you will come forward, _tribe by tribe_, ^[Literally "according to your tribes"] and the tribe that Yahweh will select by lot will come forward by clans, and the clan that Yahweh selects by lot will come forward by families, and the family that Yahweh selects by lot will come forward one by one.

###### v15
The one caught with the devoted things ^[Hebrew "thing" or "consecrated possession"] will be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because _he transgressed the covenant_ ^[Literally "he crossed the covenant"] of Yahweh, and because he did a disgraceful thing in Israel."'"

###### v16
So ^[Or "And"] Joshua rose early in the morning and brought forward Israel, _tribe by tribe_, ^[Literally "according to its tribes"] and the tribe of Judah was selected by lot.

###### v17
And he brought forward the clans of Judah and selected the clan of the Zerahites ^[Hebrew "Zerahite"] by lot. Then he brought forward the clan of the Zerahites, ^[Hebrew "Zerahite"] one by one, and Zabdi was selected by lot.

###### v18
He brought forward his family, one by one, and Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected by lot.

###### v19
And Joshua said to Achan, "My son, please, give glory to Yahweh the God of Israel, and give him a doxology in court. ^[Some interpret "make a confession"] Tell me, please, what you have done; do not hide _it_ from me."

###### v20
And Achan answered Joshua and said, "It is true. I have sinned against Yahweh the God of Israel, and this is what I did:

###### v21
I saw among the spoil a beautiful robe from Shinar, ^["Shinar" refers to Babylonia] two hundred shekels of silver, and one bar of gold _that_ weighed fifty shekels; I coveted them and took them. They _are_ hidden in the ground inside my tent, and the silver _is_ under it."

###### v22
Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there _they were_, hidden in his tent, and the silver _was_ under it.

###### v23
And they took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] And they spread them out before the presence of Yahweh.

###### v24
Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his cattle and donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything that _was_ his, and they brought them _to_ the valley of Achor. ^[Hebrew "trouble"; a valley in the Jericho region]

###### v25
And Joshua said, "Why did you bring us trouble? Yahweh will bring you trouble on this day." And all Israel stoned them ^[Hebrew "him"] _with_ stones; ^[Hebrew "stone"] and they burned them with fire _after_ they stoned them with stones.

###### v26
Then _they placed_ ^[Literally "they raised up"] on top of him a great pile of stones _that remains_ to this day. And Yahweh _turned from his burning anger_, ^[Literally "turned from his burning nose"] and thus the name of that place to this day is called the valley of Achor. ^[Hebrew "trouble"; a valley in the Jericho region]
