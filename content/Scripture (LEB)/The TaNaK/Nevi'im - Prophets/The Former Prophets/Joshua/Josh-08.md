###### v1
Then Yahweh said to Joshua, "Do not fear or be dismayed. Take _all the fighting men_ ^[Literally "all the people of war"] with you _and go up immediately to Ai_. ^[Literally "get up and go up to Ai"] Look, I am giving into your hand the king of Ai, his city, and his land.

###### v2
You will do to Ai and its king that which you did to Jericho and its king; you may take only its spoils ^[Hebrew "spoil"] and livestock as booty for yourself. Set for yourself an ambush against the city _from_ behind _it_."

###### v3
So Joshua and _all the fighting men_ ^[Literally "all the people of war"] went up immediately to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand of the best fighting men and sent them _by_ night.

###### v4
And he commanded them, saying, "Look, you are to lay an ambush against the city from behind. Do not go very far from the city and be ready.

###### v5
Then I and all of the people who _are_ with me will approach the city. And when they go out to meet us _as before_, ^[Literally "as that at the first _occasion_"] we will flee from them. ^[Or "before their presence"]

###### v6
They will come out after us until we draw them away from the city, because they will think, '_They are_ fleeing from us ^[Or "before our presence"] _as before_.' ^[Literally "as that at the first _occasion_"] So we will flee from them. ^[Or "before their presence"]

###### v7
Then you will rise up from the ambush and take possession of the city, for Yahweh your God will give it into your hand.

###### v8
And when you capture the city you will set it on fire as Yahweh commanded. Look, I have commanded you."

###### v9
So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the _place of the_ ambush, and they sat between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai; but Joshua spent the night _with the people_. ^[Literally "in the middle of the people"]

###### v10
Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up _with_ the elders of Israel before the people of Ai. ^[Or "before the presence of the people of Ai"]

###### v11
_All the fighting men_ ^[Literally "All the people of war"] who _were_ with him _went up and drew near before the city_ ^[Literally "went up, drew near, and came before the city"] and camped north of Ai; _there was_ a valley between him and Ai.

###### v12
And he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.

###### v13
So they stationed the forces; all the army _was_ north of the city while _the rear guard was west_. ^[Literally "while its rear guard _was_ west of the city"] But Joshua went that night to the middle of the valley.

###### v14
When the king of Ai saw _this_, the men of the city hurried and rose early and went out to meet Israel for battle--he ^[That is, the king] and all his army--to the meeting place before the Arabah. ^[A dry region that runs south of the Sea of Galilee along the Jordan Valley] He did not know that _there was_ an ambush for him behind the city.

###### v15
Then Joshua and all Israel acted like they were beaten before them, and they fled _in the direction of the wilderness_. ^[Literally "the way of the wilderness"]

###### v16
All of the people who _were_ in the city were called to pursue after them. As they pursued after Joshua, they were drawn away from the city.

###### v17
Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel; they left the city open and pursued after Israel.

###### v18
And Yahweh said to Joshua, "Stretch out the sword ^[Or "spear"] that is in your hand to Ai, because I will give it into your hand." And Joshua stretched out the sword that was in his hand to the city.

###### v19
The moment he stretched out his hand, those in the ambush stood up quickly from their place and ran. And they went _into_ the city and captured it, quickly setting the city ablaze with fire.

###### v20
Then the men of Ai looked behind them, and they saw smoke from the city rising to the sky; _they had no power to flee this way or that_, ^[Literally "it was not in their hands to flee here and here"] and the people fleeing the wilderness turned around to the pursuers. ^[Hebrew "pursuer"]

###### v21
And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city was rising; they returned and struck down the men of Ai.

###### v22
Then the others from the city came out to meet them, _and they found themselves surrounded by Israel_, ^[Literally "they were in the middle of Israel"] _some on one side, and others on the other side_. ^[Literally "these from these, and these from this"] And they ^[That is, Israel] struck them down until no survivor or fugitive _was_ left.

###### v23
But they captured the king of Ai alive, and they brought him to Joshua.

###### v24
When Israel finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of Ai in the open field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when all of them had fallen by _the edge of the sword_ ^[Literally "_the_ mouth of _the_ sword"] until they all had perished, all Israel returned _to_ Ai and attacked it with _the edge of the sword_. ^[Literally "_the_ mouth of _the_ sword"]

###### v25
All the people that fell on that day, both men and women, _were_ twelve thousand--all the inhabitants of Ai.

###### v26
For Joshua did not draw back his hand that was stretched out with the sword until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

###### v27
Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves, according to the word of Yahweh that Joshua commanded.

###### v28
So Joshua burned Ai and made it an everlasting heap of rubbish, a desolate place until this day.

###### v29
The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the time of evening, and as the sun went down Joshua commanded _them_, and they brought down his dead body from the tree. Then they threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and they raised over it a great heap of stones _that remains_ to this day.

###### v30
Then Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal for Yahweh the God of Israel,

###### v31
as Moses Yahweh's servant commanded the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] as _it is_ written in the scroll of the law of Moses: "an altar of unhewn ^[Or "whole"] stones _on_ which no one has _wielded_ ^[Literally "waved over them"] an iron implement." ^[See [[Exod-20#v25|Exod 20:25]]] And they offered burnt offerings on it and sacrificed fellowship offerings.

###### v32
And there Joshua wrote on the stones _a_ copy of the law of Moses, which he ^[That is, Moses] had written, in the presence of the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v33
Then all Israel, _foreigner as well as native_, ^[Literally "as the alien as the native"] with the elders, officials, and judges stood _on either side_ ^[Literally "from this and from this"] of the ark before the priests and the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. Half of them _stood_ in front of Mount Gerizim, and the other half in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses Yahweh's servant had commanded before to bless the people of Israel.

###### v34
And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings ^[Hebrew "blessing"] and the curses, ^[Hebrew "curse"] according to all that was written in the scroll of the law.

###### v35
There was not a word from all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before the assembly of all Israel, and the women, the little children, and the traveling foreigners ^[Hebrew "foreigner"] among them.
