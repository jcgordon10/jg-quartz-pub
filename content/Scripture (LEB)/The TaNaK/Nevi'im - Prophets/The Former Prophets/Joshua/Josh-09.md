###### v1
Now ^[Or "And it happened"] when all the kings who _were_ beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the Shephelah, ^[Or "lowlands"; a geographical region on the western edge of the hills of Judea] and on all the coast of the great sea toward Lebanon ^[Literally "white mountain"]--the Hittites, ^[Hebrew "Hittite"] the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] the Canaanites, ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] the Perizzites, ^[Hebrew "Perizzite"] the Hivites, ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] and the Jebusites ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"]--heard of _this_,

###### v2
they gathered themselves together to fight with one accord against ^[Hebrew "with"] Joshua and Israel.

###### v3
But the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua did to Jericho and Ai,

###### v4
and they acted on their part with cunning: they went and prepared provisions, ^[The Hebrew is difficult here. Some ancient manuscripts read, "they sent out a delegation/an envoy"] and took worn-out sacks ^[Or "sackcloths"] for their donkeys and old wineskins _that were_ torn and mended.

###### v5
The sandals on their feet _were_ patched and old, their clothes _were_ old, and their food was dry and crumbled.

###### v6
And they went to Joshua at the camp _at_ Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, "We have come from a far land; so then _make a covenant with us_." ^[Literally "cut for us a covenant"]

###### v7
And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] "Perhaps you _are_ living among us; how can we _make a covenant_ ^[Literally "cut a covenant"] with you?"

###### v8
They said to Joshua, "We _are_ your servants." And Joshua said to them, "Who _are_ you, and from where do you come?"

###### v9
And they said to him, "Your servants have come from a very far land because of the name of Yahweh your God; we have heard of his reputation, of all that he did in Egypt,

###### v10
and of all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who _were_ beyond the Jordan--to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who _was_ in Ashtaroth.

###### v11
So our elders said to us and all the inhabitants of our land, 'Take in your hand provisions for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, "We _are_ your servants; so then _make a covenant with us_."' ^[Literally "cut for us a covenant"]

###### v12
This _is_ our bread; _it was_ hot _when_ we took it from our houses as provisions on the day we set out to come to you. But now, look, it is dry and crumbled.

###### v13
These _are_ the wineskins that we filled new, but look, they have burst; and these _are_ our clothes and sandals that have worn out from the very long journey."

###### v14
So the leaders ^[Or "men"] took from their provisions, but _they did not ask direction from Yahweh_. ^[Literally "the mouth of Yahweh they did not ask"]

###### v15
And Joshua made peace with them, and _he made a covenant with them_ ^[Literally "he cut a covenant with them"] to allow them to live happily, and the leaders of the congregation swore _an oath_ to them.

###### v16
And it happened that at the end of three days, after they made a covenant with them, they heard that _they were their neighbors_ ^[Literally "they _were_ near them"] and living among them.

###### v17
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] set out and went to their cities on the third day (their cities _were_ Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim).

###### v18
But the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured _against their leaders_. ^[Literally "against the leaders of the congregation"]

###### v19
But all the leaders of the congregation said, "We have sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel, and so we cannot touch them.

###### v20
This we will do to them: _we will_ let them live so that wrath will not be on us because of the oath we swore to them."

###### v21
And the leaders ^[Or "men"] said to them, "Let them live." So they became woodcutters and water carriers for all the congregation, just as the leaders had said to them.

###### v22
And Joshua summoned them and said, "Why have you deceived us saying, 'We _are_ very far from you' when you _are_ living among us?

###### v23
Therefore you _are_ cursed; some of you will always be slaves as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God."

###### v24
And they answered Joshua and said, "Because it was told with certainty to your servants that Yahweh your God commanded Moses his servant to give to you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you, so we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and so we did this thing.

###### v25
So then, look, we _are_ in your hand; do with us whatever seems good and right in your eyes."

###### v26
So he did this to them: he saved them from the hand of the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and they did not kill them.

###### v27
And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place that he should choose.
