###### v1
And it happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard _this_, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Acshaph,

###### v2
and to the kings who _were_ in the north in the hill country, in the Arabah ^[A dry region that runs south of the Sea of Galilee along the Jordan valley] south of Kinnereth, ^[That is, the Sea of Galilee] in the Shephelah, ^[Or "lowlands"; a geographical region on the western edge of the hills of Judea] and in Naphoth Dor ^[Or "the heights of Dor"] in _the_ west,

###### v3
to the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] in _the_ east and _west_, the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] the Hittites, ^[Hebrew "Hittite"] the Perizzites, ^[Hebrew "Perizzite"] and the Jebusites ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"] in the hill country, and the Hivites ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] _at the foot of_ ^[Literally "under"] Hermon in the land of Mizpah.

###### v4
They came out, they and all their armies with them, _as_ a great army like the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.

###### v5
And all these kings joined forces, and they came and camped together by the waters of Merom to fight with Israel.

###### v6
And Yahweh said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid because of their presence, for tomorrow at this time I _will_ hand them over slain to Israel; you will hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire."

###### v7
So Joshua, and _all the fighting men_ ^[Literally "all the people of war"] with him, came against them suddenly at the waters of Merom, and _they attacked them_. ^[Literally "they fell upon them"]

###### v8
And Yahweh gave them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them and pursued them up to Great Sidon and Misrephoth Maim, and eastward up to the valley of Mizpeh. And they struck them until they left behind no survivor.

###### v9
And Joshua did to them as Yahweh commanded him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.

###### v10
Then Joshua turned back at that time, and he captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, because Hazor formerly _was_ the head of all these kingdoms.

###### v11
He struck all the people that _were_ in it with _the edge of the sword_, ^[Literally "_the_ mouth of _the_ sword"] utterly destroying them. _There was no one left who breathed_, ^[Literally "No one was left over of any breath"] and he burned Hazor with fire.

###### v12
And Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he utterly destroyed them with _the edge of the sword_, ^[Literally "_the_ mouth of _the_ sword"] as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded.

###### v13
Israel did not burn the cities standing on their mounds, ^[Hebrew "mound"] except Hazor alone, _which_ Joshua burned.

###### v14
And all the spoil and livestock of these cities the _Israelites_ took as booty; they struck the people with _the edge of the sword_, ^[Literally "_the_ mouth of _the_ sword"] until they had destroyed them--they left behind no one who breathed.

###### v15
Just as Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did; he left nothing undone that Yahweh had commanded Moses.

###### v16
So Joshua took all this land: the hill country, all the Negev, ^[An arid region south of the Judaean hills] all the land of Goshen, ^[A southern region; the name means "on the mountains"] the Shephelah, ^[Or "lowlands"; a geographical region on the western edge of the hills of Judea] the Arabah, ^[A dry region that runs south of the Sea of Galilee along the Jordan valley] and the hill country of Israel and its Shephelah, ^[Or "lowlands"; a geographical region on the western edge of the hills of Judea]

###### v17
from Mount Halak _that_ rises to Seir and to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon ^[Or "white mountain"] _at the foot of_ ^[Literally "under"] Mount Hermon; he captured all their kings, struck them, and killed them.

###### v18
_For_ many days Joshua made war with all these kings.

###### v19
There was not a city that made peace with the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] besides the Hivites ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] and the inhabitants of Gibeon--_all were taken in battle_. ^[Literally "the all they took in the battle"]

###### v20
For it was Yahweh that _hardened their hearts_, ^[Literally "made their heart_s_ strong"] to meet Israel in war in order to utterly destroy them without mercy, that they would destroy them just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

###### v21
At that time Joshua came and exterminated the Anakites from the hill country, from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.

###### v22
None of the Anakites were left in the land of the _Israelites_; ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] some remained only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.

###### v23
Joshua took all the land according to all that Yahweh had spoken to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel, according to their tribal divisions, and the land rested from war.
