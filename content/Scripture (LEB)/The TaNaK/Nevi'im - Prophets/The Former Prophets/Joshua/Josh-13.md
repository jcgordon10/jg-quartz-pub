This _is_ the remaining land: all the regions of the Philistines, and all _of_ the Geshurites, ^[Hebrew "Geshurite"]

###### v3
from the Shihor, which _is_ _east of Egypt_, ^[Literally "on the face of Egypt"] up to the border of Ekron to _the_ north, which is reckoned as Canaanite; _there are_ five Philistine rulers: the Gazites, ^[Hebrew "Gazite"] Ashdodites, ^[Hebrew "Ashdodite"] Ashkelonites, ^[Hebrew "Ashkelonite"] Gittites, ^[Hebrew "Gittite"] Ekronites, ^[Hebrew "Ekronite"] and the Avvim.

and the land of the Gebalites, and all the Lebanon, ^[Or "white mountain"] _toward the east_, ^[Literally "the rise of the sun"] from Baal Gad _at the foot of_ ^[Or "below" or "under"] Mount Hermon up to Lebo-Hamath;

###### v6
all the inhabitants of the hill country, from the Lebanon ^[Or "white mountain"] up to Misrephoth Maim, and all _the_ Sidonians. I will drive them out from before the _Israelites_; ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] only allocate it to Israel as an inheritance just as I have commanded you.

###### v7
Therefore, divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh."

With it ^[That is, the other half-tribe of Manasseh] the Reubenites, ^[Hebrew "Reubenite"] and the Gadites ^[Hebrew "Gadite"] received their inheritance, which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses Yahweh's servant gave to them:

from Aroer, which _is_ on the edge of the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Arnon, and the city which _is_ in the middle of the wadi, and all the plateau _from_ Medeba up to Dibon;

###### v14
