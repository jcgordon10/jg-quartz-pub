###### v1
These _are the territories_ that the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the tribes of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] gave as an inheritance to them.

###### v2
Their inheritance _was_ by lot, just as Yahweh commanded through the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.

###### v3
For Moses had given _an_ inheritance of _the_ two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.

###### v4
For the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they did not give a plot of ground to the Levites in the land, only cities to live _in_, with their pastureland for their flocks and for their goods.

###### v5
Just as Yahweh commanded Moses, so the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did; and they allotted the land.

###### v6
Then the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal; and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know the word that Yahweh said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea concerning you and me.

###### v7
_I was forty years old_ ^[Literally "I _was_ a son of forty year_s_"] when Moses Yahweh's servant sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I returned _with an honest report_. ^[Literally "with a word just as _was_ with my heart"]

###### v8
My companions who went up with me made the hearts ^[Hebrew "heart"] of the people melt, but I remained true to Yahweh my God.

###### v9
And Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land that your foot has trodden on will be an inheritance to you and your sons forever, because you remained true to Yahweh my God.'

###### v10
So then, look, Yahweh has kept me alive just as he promised these forty-five years, ^[Hebrew "year"] from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses while Israel _wandered_ ^[Literally "went"] in the wilderness. Now look, today _I am eighty-five years old_. ^[Literally "I _am_ a son of eighty-five year_s_"]

###### v11
Today I am still strong, just as on the day that Moses sent me; as my strength _was_ then, so now also _is_ my strength for war _and for daily activities_. ^[Literally "for going out and for coming _in_"]

###### v12
So now give me this hill country that Yahweh spoke _of_ on that day, for you heard on that day that the Anakites _were_ there, with great and fortified cities. Perhaps Yahweh _is_ with me, and I will drive them out just as Yahweh promised." ^[Or "said"]

###### v13
And Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb son of Jephunneh as an inheritance.

###### v14
Thus Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he remained true to Yahweh the God of Israel.

###### v15
And the name of Hebron formerly _was_ Kiriath Arba; ^[Or "the city of Arba"] _Arba was_ the greatest person among the Anakites. And the land rested from war.
