The allotment for the tribe of the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Judah according to their families reached to the border of Edom, to the wilderness of Zin, _to the far south_. ^[Literally "to the south at the end of south"]

###### v2
Their southern border was from the end of the Salt Sea, ^[That is, the Dead Sea] from the bay facing southward;

###### v3
it continues ^[Hebrew "goes out"] to _the_ south to the ascent of Akrabbim, passes _along_ to Zin, it goes up south of Kadesh Barnea, passes _along_ Hezron, goes up to Addar, and makes a turn to Karka;

###### v4
_it passes on_ ^[Literally "it was to"] to Azmon, continues ^[Hebrew "goes out"] by the wadi of Egypt, and _it ends_ ^[Literally "the goings out of the border were"] at the sea. This will be your southern border.

###### v5
_The_ eastern border _is_ the Salt Sea ^[That is, the Dead Sea] up to the mouth ^[Or "end"] of the Jordan. _The_ border on _the_ northern side _runs_ from the bay of the sea at the mouth ^[Or "end"] of the Jordan;

###### v6
the border goes up to Beth-hoglah and passes _along_ north of Beth Arabah; and the border goes up the stone of Bohan son of Reuben;

and the border goes up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and to the north, turning to Gilgal, which _is_ opposite the ascent of Adummim, which _is_ south of the wadi; ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] and the border passes on to the waters of En Shemesh, and it ends at En Rogel.

Then the border goes up _by_ the Valley of Ben Hinnom ^[Or "valley of the son of Hinnom"] to the slope of the Jebusites ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"] from _the_ south (that _is_, Jerusalem); and the border goes up to the top of the mountain that _lies_ opposite the valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim to the north;

###### v9
then the border turns from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and continues ^[Hebrew "goes out"] from there to the cities of Mount Ephron; the border _then_ turns _to_ Baalah (that _is_, Kiriath Jearim);

###### v10
and the border goes around from Baalah to the west, to Mount Seir, and passes on to the slope of Mount Jearim from the north (that _is_, Kesalon), and goes down _to_ Beth Shemesh, and passes _along by_ Timnah.

###### v11
The border continues ^["Hebrew "goes out"] to the slope of Ekron to the north, _then_ bends around to Shikkeron, it passes _on_ to Mount Baalah and continues _to_ Jabneel; and _the border ends_ ^[Literally "the goings out of the border were"] at the sea.

###### v12
And _the_ western border _is_ to the Great Sea ^[That is, the Mediterranean] and its coast. This _is_ the border surrounding the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Judah according to their families.

###### v13
_According to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua_, ^[Literally "according to the mouth of Yahweh to Joshua"] he gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh a plot of ground among the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Judah, Kiriath Arba, ^[Or "the city of Arba"] which _is_ Hebron (_Arba_ was Anak's father).

###### v14
Caleb drove out from there three of Anak's sons, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the descendants ^[Or "children"] of Anak.

###### v15
And from there he went up against the inhabitants of Debir (the former name of Debir _was_ Kiriath Sepher).

###### v16
And Caleb said, "Whoever attacks Kiriath Sepher and captures it, I will give to him my daughter Acsah as a wife."

###### v17
Othniel son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it, and he gave to him Acsah his daughter as a wife.

###### v18
When she came _to him_ she urged him to ask her father for a field. So she dismounted from the donkey, and Caleb said to her, "_What do you want_?" ^[Literally "What _is_ for you?"]

###### v19
And she said to him, "Give to me a gift; ^[Or "blessing"] you have given me the land of the Negev, ^[An arid region south of the Judaean hills] and you must give to me a spring of water." And he gave to her the upper and lower spring. ^[[[Josh-15#v13|Joshua 15:13–19]][[Josh-15#v14|]][[Josh-15#v15|]][[Josh-15#v16|]][[Josh-15#v17|]][[Josh-15#v18|]][[Josh-15#v19|]] is almost identical to [[Judg-01#v11|Judges 1:11–15]][[Judg-01#v12|]][[Judg-01#v13|]][[Judg-01#v14|]][[Judg-01#v15|]]]
