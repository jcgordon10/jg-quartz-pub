###### v1
The allotment of the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Joseph went from _the_ Jordan by Jericho, at the waters of Jericho to the east, _into_ the wilderness, going up from Jericho into the hill country _to_ Bethel;

###### v2
it continues from Bethel to Luz, and it passes _along_ to the territory of the Arkites ^[Hebrew "Arkite"] at Ataroth.

###### v3
Then it goes down, to the west, to the territory of the Japhletites, ^[Hebrew "Japhletite"] up to the territory of Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and _it ends_ ^[Literally "the goings out of it were"] at the sea.

###### v4
And the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.

###### v5
_This_ was the border of the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Ephraim according to their families: the border of their inheritance to the east _was_ Ataroth Addar, up to Upper Beth-horon.

###### v6
The border continues to the sea; from Micmethath to _the_ north, the border turns to the east to Taanath Shiloh, and it passes _along_ it from the east to Janoah.

###### v7
Then it goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah; it touches Jericho and ends _at_ the Jordan;

###### v8
from Tappuah the border goes to the west, _to_ the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Kanah, and _it ends_ ^[Literally "the goings out of it were"] at the sea. This _is_ the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Ephraim according to their families,

###### v9
with the cities that were set apart for the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Manasseh, all the cities and their villages.

###### v10
But they did not drive out the Canananites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] who were dwelling in Gezer, and so the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] live in the midst of Ephraim to this day, but they became forced laborers.
