###### v1
Then the allotment was made for the tribe of Manasseh, because he _was_ the firstborn of Joseph. To Makir, the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, _were allotted_ ^[Literally "and there was to him"] Gilead and Bashan, because he was a warrior. ^[Literally "a man of war"]

###### v2
_An allotment_ was _made_ for the remaining descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Manasseh, according to their families: For the children of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida--these _were_ the male descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Manasseh son of Joseph according to their families.

###### v3
But Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. These _are_ the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

###### v4
They came before Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, saying, "Yahweh commanded Moses to give an inheritance to us among our kinsmen." ^[Or "among our brothers"] Therefore, according to the _command of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "mouth of Yahweh"] he gave them an inheritance among the kinsmen ^[Or "brothers"] of their father.

###### v5
Thus ten shares fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which _is_ beyond the Jordan,

###### v6
because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead was _allotted_ to the remaining descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Manasseh.

###### v7
The border of Manasseh was from Asher _to_ Micmethath, which _is_ opposite Shechem; ^[Or "which faces Shechem"] then the border goes to the south, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.

###### v8
The land of Tappuah _belonged to Manasseh_, ^[Literally "was to Manasseh"] but Tuppuah on the border of Manasseh _belonged to the descendants of Ephraim_. ^[Literally "was to the children of Ephraim"]

###### v9
Then the border goes down _to_ the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Kanah to the south of the wadi. These cities _belong_ to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh _is_ north of the wadi, and _it ends_ ^[Literally "the goings out of it were"] at the sea.

###### v10
The south _is_ Ephraim's, and the north _is_ Manasseh's; the sea is their ^[Hebrew "its"] border; Asher touches _the_ north and on _the_ east Issachar.

###### v11
In Issachar and Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages, Ibleam and its villages, the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; the third is Napheth.

###### v12
But the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Manasseh were not able to take possession of these towns; the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] were determined to live in this land.

###### v13
And it happened, when the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] grew strong, they put the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] to forced labor but never drove them out completely.

###### v14
The descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Joseph spoke with Joshua, saying, "Why have you given us ^[Hebrew "to me"] one allotment and one share _as_ an inheritance? We are many people, which Yahweh has blessed."

###### v15
And Joshua said to them, "If you _are_ many people, go up to the forest and clear _a place_ there for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites ^[Hebrew "Perizzite"] and Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is _too_ narrow for you."

###### v16
And the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us, and all of the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] living in the land of the valley _have_ chariots ^[Hebrew "chariot"] of iron, those in Beth-shean and its villages, and those in the Jezreel Valley."

###### v17
And Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, "You are many people and have great power; you will not have one allotment _only_;

###### v18
_the_ hill country will be yours. Even though it _is_ a forest, you will clear it, and it will be yours _to_ its farthest borders. You will drive out the Canaanites, ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] even though they have iron chariots and _are_ strong."
