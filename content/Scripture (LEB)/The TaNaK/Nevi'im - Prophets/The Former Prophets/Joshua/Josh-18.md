###### v1
The entire congregation of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] assembled _at_ Shiloh, and they set up there the tent of meeting, and the land was subdued before them. ^[Or "in their presence"]

###### v2
And seven tribes remained among the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] who had not been apportioned their inheritance.

###### v3
And Joshua said to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] "_How long_ ^[Literally "Until when"] _will_ you be slack about going to take possession of the land that Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] has given you?

###### v4
Provide three men _from each tribe_, ^[Literally "according to each tribe"] and I will send them so that they may begin to go through the land and write _a description of_ it _according to their inheritance_, ^[Literally "according to the mouth of their inheritance"] and let them come to me.

###### v5
They will divide it among themselves into seven portions; _Judah will maintain its border_ ^[Literally "Judah will stand on its border"] from _the_ south, and _the house of Joseph will maintain its border_ ^[Literally "the house of Joseph will stand on its border"] from _the_ north.

###### v6
Describe the land _in_ seven divisions, and bring _it_ to me here; I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God.

###### v7
The Levites among you have no portion, for their inheritance _is_ the priesthood of Yahweh; Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh received their inheritance beyond the Jordan to the east, which Moses Yahweh's servant gave to them."

###### v8
And _the men went immediately_, ^[Literally "the men got up and went"] and Joshua commanded the ones going to describe the land, saying, "Go and walk about through the land, write _a description_, and return to me, and here I will cast a lot for you before ^[Or "in the presence of"] Yahweh at Shiloh."

Their northern border began at the Jordan and went up to the slope of Jericho on _the_ north and continued into the hill country to the west; _it ends_ ^[Literally "the goings out of it were"] at the wilderness of Beth Aven.

The border passes _on_ from there to Luz, to the slope of Luz to the south (that _is_, Bethel); then the border goes down to Ataroth Addar to the mountain that is south of Lower Beth-Horon.

Then the border changes direction and turns to the western side southward, from the mountain that _is opposite_ ^[Literally "against the face of"] Beth-Horon to the south. _It ends_ ^[Literally "the goings out of it were"] at Kiriath Baal (that _is_, Kiriath Jearim), a town belonging to the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Judah.

the border goes down to the foot ^[Or "to the edge"] of the mountain, which _is_ opposite the Valley of Ben Hinnom, ^[Or "valley of the son of-Hinnom"] which _is_ in the valley of Rephaim to the north; then it does down the valley of Hinnom to the slope of the Jebusites ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"] to the south, and then it goes down _to_ En Rogel.

###### v17
