###### v1
Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,

###### v2
and he said to them, "You have observed all that Moses Yahweh's servant commanded you, and you have listened ^[Or "you have obeyed"] to my voice in all that I have commanded you;

###### v3
you have not forsaken your kinsmen ^[Or "brothers"] these many days, up to this day, and you have observed the obligation of the command of Yahweh your God.

###### v4
So then, Yahweh your God has given rest to your kinsmen, ^[Or "brothers"] just as he promised them; so then, turn and go to your tents to the land of your possession, which Moses Yahweh's servant gave to you beyond the Jordan.

###### v5
Only be very careful to observe the commandment and law that Moses Yahweh's servant commanded you, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul." ^[Or "inner self"]

###### v6
And Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.

###### v7
And to the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given _a possession_ in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua had given _a possession_ with their kinsmen ^[Or "brothers"] beyond the Jordan to the west; and when Joshua sent them to their tents and blessed them,

###### v8
he said to them, "Return to your tents with much wealth, and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, copper, iron, and with very much clothing; divide the war-booty of your enemies with your kinsmen." ^[Or "brothers"]

###### v9
So the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned _home_ and departed with the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] at Shiloh, which _is_ in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead to the land of their possession, which they had acquired _according to the command of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "on the mouth of Yahweh"] through the hand of Moses.

###### v10
And they came to the region of the Jordan that _is_ in the land of Canaan, and the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar on the Jordan, _a large and imposing altar_. ^[Literally "a large altar to appearance"]

###### v11
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] heard _it_ said that the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar next to the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, on the side _belonging to_ the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v12
When the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] heard _of it_, the whole congregation of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] gathered _at_ Shiloh to go up against them for battle.

###### v13
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] sent to the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, Phinehas the priest son of Eleazar,

###### v14
and ten leaders with him, _one leader for each_ ^[Literally "one leader, one leader"] _family_ ^[Literally "of the house of father"] from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one _was_ the head of _his family_ ^[Literally "house of their fathers"] among the clans of Israel. ^[Or "thousands of Israel"]

###### v15
They came to the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,

###### v16
"Thus says all the congregation of Yahweh: 'What _is_ this treachery that you have committed against the God of Israel by turning away today from following Yahweh, by building for yourselves an altar to rebel today against Yahweh?

###### v17
_Is_ not the sin of Peor _enough for us_, ^[Literally "too little for us"] from which we have not cleansed ourselves today, and for which a plague came to the congregation of Yahweh,

###### v18
that you must turn today from following Yahweh? _If_ you rebel today against Yahweh, tomorrow he will be angry with all of the congregation of Israel;

###### v19
if, however, the land of your property _is_ unclean, cross _over_ to the land of Yahweh's property, where Yahweh's tabernacle resides, ^[Or "stands"] and take possession among us. But you must not rebel against Yahweh or against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of Yahweh our God.

###### v20
Did not Achan son of Zerah commit treachery with devoted things, ^[Or "consecrated possession"] and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? _And he alone_ ^[Literally "And he _is_ one man that"] did not perish because of his iniquity.'"

###### v21
And the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh spoke with the heads of the clans ^[Or "thousands"] of Israel,

###### v22
"Yahweh, God of gods! Yahweh, God of gods knows. And let Israel itself know, if _it was_ in rebellion or treachery against Yahweh, do not spare us this day

###### v23
for building for ourselves an altar to turn away from Yahweh, or if _it was_ to offer burnt offerings, ^[Hebrew "offering"] grain offerings, ^[Hebrew "offering"] or fellowship offerings on it, may Yahweh himself take vengeance.

###### v24
But in fact, we have done this because of anxiety, because of a reason, saying, 'In the future your children may say to our children, '_What is the relationship between you and Yahweh the God of Israel_? ^[Literally "What is to you and to Yahweh the God of Israel"]

###### v25
Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben and Gad; you have no portion in Yahweh.' So your children may put an end to our children worshiping ^[Or "seeing"] Yahweh.

###### v26
So we said, 'Let us build immediately for ourselves an altar, not for burnt offerings ^[Hebrew "offering"] or for sacrifices; ^[Hebrew "sacrifice"]

###### v27
instead, it _is_ a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us for performing the serving of Yahweh in his presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings; so that your children may not say in the future to our children, "You have no portion in Yahweh."'

###### v28
And we thought, if they say to us and to our children in the future, we can say, 'Look at this replica of the altar of Yahweh, which our ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] made, not for burnt offerings ^[Hebrew "offering"] or sacrifices; ^[Hebrew "sacrifice"] rather, it _is_ a witness between us and you.'

###### v29
Far be it from us to rebel against Yahweh, to turn today from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offerings, ^[Hebrew "offering"] grain offerings, ^[Hebrew "offering"] or sacrifices, ^[Hebrew "sacrifice"] instead of the altar of Yahweh our God that _is_ before his tabernacle."

###### v30
Phinehas the priest, the leaders of the congregation, and the heads of the clans ^[Or "thousands"] of Israel who _were_ with him heard the words that the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh spoke, and _they were satisfied_. ^[Literally "it was good in their eyes"]

###### v31
Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, said to the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, "Today we know that Yahweh _is_ among us, because you have not committed this treachery against Yahweh. Therefore you have rescued the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] from the hand of Yahweh."

###### v32
And Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, and the leaders returned from the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben and Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and _they gave them their report_. ^[Literally "they brought back a word to them"]

###### v33
_The report satisfied the Israelites_; ^[Literally "The report was good in the eyes of the children of Israel"] they blessed God, and they did not speak of going up for battle against them to destroy the land in which the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben and Gad were living. ^[Or "dwelling"]

###### v34
The descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben and Gad called the altar Witness, "Because," _they said_, "it _is_ a witness between us that Yahweh _is_ God."
