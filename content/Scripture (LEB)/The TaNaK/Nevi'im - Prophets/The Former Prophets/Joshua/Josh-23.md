###### v1
And it happened, after _a long time_, ^[Literally "many days"] after Yahweh had given rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies, and _after_ Joshua was old and _well-advanced in years_, ^[Literally "he went into the days"]

###### v2
Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders, heads, judges, and officials, and he said to them, "I am old and _well-advanced in years_, ^[Literally "I went into the days"]

###### v3
and you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations _for your sake_, ^[Literally "because of your presence"] for Yahweh your God _is_ fighting for you.

###### v4
Look! I have allotted to you these remaining nations as an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, _with_ all the nations that I have cut off, to the Great Sea ^[That is, the Mediterranean] _in the west_. ^[Literally "to the setting of the sun"]

###### v5
And Yahweh your God will push them _back before you_ ^[Literally "from your presence"] and drive them _out of your sight_, ^[Literally "from your face"] and you will possess their land, just as Yahweh your God promised to you.

###### v6
Be very strong to observe carefully all that is written in the scroll of the law of Moses so as not to turn aside from it, _to_ the right or left,

###### v7
so as not to go among these remaining nations with you; _do not profess_ ^[Literally "do not mention"] the name of their gods, and do not swear by them, serve them, or _bow down to them_. ^[Literally "bow yourselves down to them"]

###### v8
But hold fast to Yahweh your God, just as you have done up to this day.

###### v9
Yahweh has driven out before you great and strong nations; and as for you, _nobody has withstood_ ^[Literally "a man has not stood in your presence"] you to this day.

###### v10
One of your men put to flight a thousand, for Yahweh your God _is_ fighting for you, just as he promised you.

###### v11
Take utmost care for _the sake of_ your life to love Yahweh your God,

###### v12
for if indeed you turn back and join these remaining nations _among you_, ^[Literally "with you"] and you intermarry with them, _marrying their women and they yours_, ^[Literally "you go into them and they into you"]

###### v13
know for certain that Yahweh your God _will not continue to drive out_ ^[Literally "will not drive out again"] these nations from before you; they will be for you a snare and a trap, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that Yahweh your God has given to you.

###### v14
Look! _I am about to die_, ^[Literally "I am going today on the way of all the earth"] and you know in all your hearts ^[Hebrew "heart"] and souls ^[Hebrew "soul"; or "inner self"] that not one thing _failed_ ^[Literally "fell"] from all the good things that Yahweh your God promised concerning you; everything _has been fulfilled_; ^[Literally "has come _out_"] _not one thing failed_. ^[Literally "not one thing fell from it"]

###### v15
But just as all the good things ^[Hebrew "thing"] came to you that Yahweh your God promised, so will Yahweh bring to you all the bad things ^[Hebrew "things"] until he has destroyed you from this good land that Yahweh your God has given to you.

###### v16
If you transgress the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he commanded _to_ you, and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, _Yahweh's anger will be kindled_ ^[Literally "Yahweh's nose will become hot"] against you, and you will perish quickly from the good land that he has given to you."
