###### v1
After the death of Joshua, the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] inquired of Yahweh, saying, "Who will go up first for us against the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] to fight against them?"

###### v2
And Yahweh said, "Judah will go up. I hereby give the land into his hand."

###### v3
And Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Go up with me into my allotment, and let us fight against the Canaanites; then I too will go with you into your allotment." And Simeon went with him.

###### v4
And Judah went up, and Yahweh gave the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] and the Perizzites ^[Hebrew "Perizzite"] into their hand, and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek.

###### v5
At Bezek they came upon Adoni-bezek, and they fought against him and defeated the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] and the Perizzites. ^[Hebrew "Perizzite"]

###### v6
And Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued after him; they caught him and cut off _his thumbs and big toes_. ^[Literally "the thumbs of his hands and feet"]

###### v7
Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings with _their thumbs and big toes_ ^[Literally "the thumbs of their hands and feet"] cut off used to pick up _scraps_ under my table; just as I have done, so God has repaid to me. And they brought him _to_ Jerusalem, and he died there.

###### v8
The descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and they captured it, _put it to the sword_, ^[Literally "they struck it with the mouth of the sword"] and _set the city on fire_. ^[Literally "the city they sent away with fire"]

###### v9
Afterward the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Judah pursued to fight against the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] who were living in the hill country, the Negev, ^[An arid region south of the Judean hills] and the Shephelah. ^[A geographical region associated with an area of low country on the western edge of the Judaean hills.]

###### v10
And Judah went against the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] living in Hebron (the former name of Hebron _was_ Kiriath Arba). And they defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.

###### v11
And from there they went to the inhabitants of Debir (the former name of Debir _was_ Kiriath Sepher).

###### v12
And Caleb said, "Whoever attacks Kiriath Sepher and captures it, I will give to him Acsah my daughter as a wife."

###### v13
Othniel son of Kenaz, the younger brother of Caleb, captured it, and he gave to him Acsah his daughter as a wife.

###### v14
When she came _to him_, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from the donkey, Caleb said to her, "_What do you want_?" ^[Literally "What _is_ for you?"]

###### v15
And she said to him, "Give me _a gift_; ^[Literally "blessing"] you have given me the land of the Negev, ^[An arid region south of the Judaean hills] and give me also a spring of water." And Caleb gave to her the upper and lower spring. ^[[[Judg-01#v11|Judges 1:11–15]][[Judg-01#v12|]][[Judg-01#v13|]][[Judg-01#v14|]][[Judg-01#v15|]] is almost identical to [[Josh-15#v13|Joshua 15:13–19]][[Josh-15#v14|]][[Josh-15#v15|]][[Josh-15#v16|]][[Josh-15#v17|]][[Josh-15#v18|]][[Josh-15#v19|]]]

###### v16
The descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Hobab _the_ Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Judah from the city of palms _into_ the wilderness of Judah, which _is_ in _the_ Negev ^[An arid region south of the Judaean hills] _near_ Arad. And they went ^[Hebrew "he went"] and settled with the people.

###### v17
And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they defeated the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] inhabiting Zephath; they utterly destroyed it, so he called the name of the city Hormah.

###### v18
Judah captured Gaza and its territory, Ashkelon and its territory, and Ekron and its territory.

###### v19
And Yahweh was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they _had_ chariots of iron.

###### v20
They gave Hebron to Caleb just as Moses said, and he drove out the three sons of Anak from there.

###### v21
But the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"] who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived among the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.

###### v22
Likewise, the house of Joseph went up _against_ Bethel, and Yahweh _was_ with them.

###### v23
And the house of Joseph spied out Bethel (the former name of the city was Luz).

###### v24
And when the spies saw a man leaving the city, ^[Or "going out from the city"] they said to him, "Please show us the entrance of the city, and we will deal kindly ^[Or "do a loyal love"] with you."

###### v25
So he showed them the entrance of the city, and they struck the city with _the edge of the sword_, ^[Literally "_the_ mouth of _the_ sword"] but they let go the man and all his family.

###### v26
And the man went _to_ the land of the Hittites, and he built a city and named it Luz; this _is_ its name to this day.

###### v27
Manasseh did not drive out Beth-Sean and its towns, or Taanach and its towns, or the inhabitants ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"] of Dor and its towns, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] _were_ determined to live in this land.

###### v28
And it happened, when Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] to forced labor, but they never totally drove them out.

###### v29
Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] living in Gezer, so the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] lived in their midst in Gezer.

###### v30
Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or Nahalol, so the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] lived in their midst and became _subjected_ to forced labor.

###### v31
Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob,

###### v32
so the Asherites ^[Hebrew "Asherite"] lived in the midst of the Canaanites, ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.

###### v33
Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or Beth-anath, but lived in the midst of the Canaanites, ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] the inhabitants of the land; the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them.

###### v34
The Amorites pressed ^[Or "forced"] the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Dan to the hill country, and they did not allow them to come down to the plain;

###### v35
the Amorites _were_ determined to live in Har-heres, ^[Or "Mount Heres"] in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph was heavy _on them_, and they became _subjected_ to forced labor.

###### v36
The border of the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] _ran_ from the ascent of Akrabbim from Sela and upward.
