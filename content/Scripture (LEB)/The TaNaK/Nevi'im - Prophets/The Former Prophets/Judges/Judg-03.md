###### v1
These _are_ the nations that Yahweh left, to test Israel by them (_that is, to test_ all those who _had not experienced_ ^[Literally "did not know"] any of the wars of Canaan,

###### v2
in order that the generations of Israel would know war, to teach those _who had not experienced it_ ^[Literally "who had not known it"] before):

###### v3
the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] the Sidonians, ^[Hebrew "Sidonian"] and the Hivites ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] living on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon up to Lebo-Hamath.

###### v4
They were _left_ for testing Israel, to know _whether_ they would keep the commands of Yahweh that he commanded their ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] through the hand of Moses.

###### v5
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] lived in the midst of the Canaanites, ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] the Hittites, ^[Hebrew "Hittite"] the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] the Perizzites, ^[Hebrew "Perizzite"] the Hivites, ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] and the Jebusites. ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"]

###### v6
And they took their daughters as wives for themselves, and they gave their daughters to their sons, and they served their gods. ^[Or "worshiped their gods"]

###### v7
The _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. They forgot Yahweh their God, and they served the Baals and the Asheroth. ^[Asheroth are cultic poles set up next to an altar symbolizing the goddess Asherah]

###### v8
And _the anger of Yahweh was kindled_ ^[Literally "the nose of Yahweh became hot"] against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Aram Naharaim; and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.

###### v9
The _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] cried out to Yahweh, and Yahweh raised up a deliverer for the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] who delivered them, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

###### v10
And the spirit of Yahweh came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and Yahweh gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into his hand, and _he prevailed over_ ^[Literally "his hand was strong over"] Cushan-Rishathaim.

###### v11
So the land rested forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.

###### v12
And again the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. So Yahweh strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because they did evil in the eyes of Yahweh.

###### v13
He gathered to himself the _Ammonites and Amalekites_, ^[Literally "sons of Ammon and Amalek" or "children of Ammon and Amalek"] and he went and defeated Israel, and they took possession of the city of palms.

###### v14
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.

###### v15
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] cried out to Yahweh, and Yahweh raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud son of Gera, a Benjaminite and _a left-handed man_. ^[Literally "a man bound by his right hand"] And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] sent a tribute to Eglon king of Moab _through him_. ^[Literally "in his hand"]

###### v16
Ehud made for himself a short, _two-edged_ ^[Literally "with two mouths"] sword (a cubit in length), and he fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh.

###### v17
Then he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon _was_ a very fat man.

###### v18
When Ehud ^[That is, Eglon] had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.

###### v19
But he turned back from the sculptured stones ^[Or "Pesilim"; some translations translate the phrase as a proper name] that _were_ near Gilgal, and he said, "I have _a secret message_ ^[Literally "a word of secrecy"] for you, O king." And he ^[Hebrew "he"] said, "Silence!" So all those standing in his presence went out,

###### v20
and Ehud came to him _while_ he _was_ sitting alone in his cool upper room. And Ehud said, "I have a _message from God_ ^[Literally "word of God"] for you." So he got up from his seat.

###### v21
Then Ehud reached with his left hand for the sword on his right thigh, and he thrust it into his ^[That is, Eglon's] stomach.

###### v22
And the handle also went _in_ after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade because he did not draw back the sword from his stomach; and it went protruding out the back. ^[The Hebrew is uncertain; some translations have "and the dirt/entrails came out"]

###### v23
And Ehud went out the vestibule, and he closed the doors of the upper room and locked _them_ behind him.

###### v24
After he left, his servants returned. When they saw _that_ the doors of the upper room _were_ locked, _they thought_, ^[Hebrew "they said"] "Surely he _is_ _relieving himself_ ^[Literally "covering his feet"] in the cool inner room."

###### v25
And they waited so long they became embarrassed because he did not open the doors of the upper room. So they took the key and opened _the doors_, and there their lord was lying on the ground dead.

###### v26
And Ehud escaped while they delayed. He passed by the sculptured stones ^[Or "Pesilim;" some translations to translate the phrase as a proper name] and escaped to Seirah.

###### v27
And when he arrived he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] went down from the hill country with him leading them.

###### v28
And he said to them, "Follow after me! Yahweh has given Moab your enemies into your hand." So they went down after him, and they captured the fords of the Jordan toward Moab; and they did not allow anyone to cross over.

###### v29
And they struck Moab at that time, about ten thousand men, _all strong and able men_; ^[Literally "all fat and men of strength"] no one escaped.

###### v30
And Moab was subdued on that day under the hand of Israel. And the land rested eighty years. ^[Hebrew "year"]

###### v31
And Shamgar son of Anath came after him, and he killed six hundred Philistines with the goad of an ox; he also delivered Israel.
