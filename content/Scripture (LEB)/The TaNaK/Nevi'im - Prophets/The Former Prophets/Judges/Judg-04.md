###### v1
And again the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and Ehud died.

###### v2
So Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army _was_ Sisera, and he _was_ living in Harosheth Haggoyim.

###### v3
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] cried to Yahweh, as he _had_ nine hundred iron chariots, ^[Hebrew "chariot"] and he oppressed the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] _cruelly_ ^[Literally "with force"] for twenty years. ^[Hebrew "year"]

###### v4
Now at that time Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, _was_ judging ^[Or "leading"] Israel.

###### v5
And she used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] went up to her for judgment.

###### v6
She sent and called for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh Naphtali and said to him, "Has not Yahweh the God of Israel commanded you? 'Go, _march to_ ^[Literally "take the lead at"] Mount Tabor, and take ten thousand men from the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Naphtali and Zebulun.

###### v7
_I will draw out_ ^[Literally "I will draw to you"] Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and troops, to the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Kishon, and I will give him into your hand.'"

###### v8
Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I will go; but if you do not go with me, I will not go."

###### v9
She said, "Surely I will go with you; however, there will be no glory for you in _the path you are taking_, ^[Or "the way you _are_ going"] for Yahweh will sell Sisera into _the_ hand of a woman." And Deborah stood up and went with Barak to Kedesh.

###### v10
Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and _they went up behind him_, ^[Literally "they went up in his feet"] ten thousand men, and Deborah went up with him.

###### v11
And Heber the Kenite _was_ separated from _the other_ Kenites, ^[Hebrew "Kenite"] _that is_, from the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses. And _he was encamped_ ^[Literally "he spread his tent"] at Elon-bezaanannim, which _is_ near Kedesh.

###### v12
When they ^[The subject is not specified in Hebrew] reported to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,

###### v13
Sisera summoned all his chariots--all nine hundred chariots ^[Hebrew "chariot"] of iron--and the entire army that _was_ with him from Harosheth Haggoyim to the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Kishon.

###### v14
And Deborah said to Barak, "Get up! This _is_ the day that Yahweh has given Sisera into your hand. Has Yahweh not gone out before you?" So Barak went out from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.

###### v15
And Yahweh threw Sisera and all his chariots and army into confusion ^[Or "routed Sisera and all _his_ chariot_s_ and army"] before _the edge of Barak's sword_; ^[Literally "_the_ mouth of _the_ sword before Barak"] and Sisera dismounted from _his_ chariot and fled on foot.

###### v16
But Barak pursued after the chariots ^[Hebrew "chariot"] and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim, and all of Sisera's army fell to _the edge of the sword_; ^[Literally "_the_ mouth of _the_ sword"] no one was left.

###### v17
Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because _there was_ peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

###### v18
And Jael came out to meet Sisera, and she said to him, "Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me and do not be afraid." So he turned aside into her tent, and she covered him _with a blanket_. ^[Literally "with a covering/rug"]

###### v19
And he said to her, "Please, give me a drink of water, because I am thirsty." So she opened a skin vessel of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.

###### v20
And he said to her, "Stand _at_ the doorway of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you, and says, 'Is there anyone here?' You must answer, 'No.'"

###### v21
But Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, took in her hand a tent peg and a hammer, and she went softly ^[Or "secretly"] to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went through into the ground; he _was_ fast asleep since he was exhausted, and he died.

###### v22
And behold, Barak _was_ pursuing Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him, and she said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you _are_ seeking." And he came with her and saw that Sisera was lying dead with the peg in his temple.

###### v23
On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v24
And the hand of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] _pressed harder_ ^[Literally "went harder"] and harder on Jabin king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
