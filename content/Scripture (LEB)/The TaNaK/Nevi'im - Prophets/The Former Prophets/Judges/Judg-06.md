###### v1
The _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh gave them into the hand of the Midianites ^[Hebrew "Midianite"] for seven years.

###### v2
The hand of the Midianites ^[Hebrew "Midianite"] prevailed over Israel; because of the presence of the Midianites, ^[Hebrew "Midianite"] the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] made for themselves hiding places that _were_ in the mountains, caves, and strongholds.

###### v3
And whenever Israel sowed seed, the Midianites, ^[Hebrew "Midianite"] Amalekites, ^[Hebrew "Amalekite"] and the people of _the_ east would come up against them.

###### v4
They would camp against them and destroy the produce of the land _as far as_ ^[Literally "until your coming to"] Gaza; they left no produce in Israel, or sheep, ox, or donkey.

###### v5
For they, their livestock, and their tents would come up like a great number of locusts; they and their camels could not be counted; they came into the land and devoured it.

###### v6
Israel was very poor because of the presence of the Midianites, ^[Hebrew "Midianite"] and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] cried out to Yahweh.

###### v7
When the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] cried out to Yahweh on account of the Midianites, ^[Hebrew "Midianite"]

###### v8
Yahweh sent a prophet to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and he said to them, "Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: 'I brought you up from Egypt; I brought you from the house of slavery. ^[Hebrew "slaves"]

###### v9
I delivered you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors, and drove them out from _before you_; ^[Literally "your face/presence"] and I gave you their land.

###### v10
And I said to you, 'I _am_ Yahweh your God; do not fear ^[Or "revere"] the gods of the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] in whose land you _are_ living.' But you have not listened to my voice."

###### v11
The angel of Yahweh came and sat under the oak ^[Or "terebinth"] that _was_ at Ophrah that belonged to Jehoash _the_ Abiezrite; and Gideon his son _was_ threshing wheat in the winepress to hide _it_ ^[Or "keep _it_ away"] from the Midianites. ^[Hebrew "Midianite"]

###### v12
The angel of Yahweh appeared to him and said to him, "Yahweh _is_ with you, _you mighty warrior_." ^[Literally "strong/mighty of power"]

###### v13
Gideon said to him, "Excuse me, my lord. _If_ Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonderful deeds that our ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] recounted to us, saying, 'Did not Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?' But now Yahweh has forsaken us; he has given us into the palm of Midian."

###### v14
And Yahweh turned to him and said, "Go in this your strength, and you will deliver Israel from the palm of Midian. Did I not send you?"

###### v15
He said to him, "Excuse me, my lord. How will I deliver Israel? Look, my clan _is_ the weakest in Manasseh, and I _am_ the youngest in my father's house."

###### v16
And Yahweh said to him, "But I will be with you, and you will defeat Midian _as if they are one man_." ^[Literally "as one man"]

###### v17
And he ^[That is, Gideon] said to him, "Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, _show me a sign_ ^[Literally "make a sign for me"] that you _are_ speaking with me.

###### v18
Please, do not depart from here until I come _back_ to you and bring out my gift and set it out before you." ^[Or "in your presence"] And he said, "I will stay until you return."

###### v19
And Gideon went and prepared _a young goat_ ^[Literally "a kid of goat"] and unleavened cakes _from_ an ephah of flour; he put meat in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and he brought _them_ to him under the oak ^[Or "terebinth"] and presented _them_.

###### v20
The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put _them_ on this rock; pour the broth _over it_." And he did so.

###### v21
Then the angel of Yahweh reached out the tip of the staff that _was_ in his hand, and he touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and fire went up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of Yahweh went _from his sight_. ^[Literally "from his eyes"]

###### v22
And Gideon realized that he _was_ the angel of Yahweh; and Gideon said, "Oh, my lord Yahweh! For now I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face."

###### v23
And Yahweh said to him, "Peace be with you. Do not fear; you will not die."

###### v24
And Gideon built there an altar to Yahweh, and he called it "Yahweh _is_ peace." To this day it is still in Ophrah _of the_ Abiezrites. ^[Hebrew "Abiezrite"]

###### v25
Now on that same night Yahweh said to him, "Take the bull of the cattle that belongs to your father, and a second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah ^[An Asherah is a cultic pole set up next to an altar symbolizing the goddess Asherah] that is beside it;

###### v26
and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold in the proper arrangement, and take a second bull and offer _it as_ a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah ^[An Asherah is a cultic pole set up next to an altar symbolizing the goddess Asherah] that you will cut down.

###### v27
Gideon took ten men from his servants, and he did just as Yahweh told him; ^[Or "spoke to him"] and because he was too afraid of his _father's family_ ^[Literally "father's house"] and the men of the city to do _it during_ the day, he did _it during_ night.

###### v28
When the men of the city got up early in the morning, look, the altar of Baal and the Asherah ^[An Asherah is a cultic pole set up next to an altar symbolizing the goddess Asherah] that _was_ beside it _were_ cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built.

###### v29
_And they said to one another_, ^[Literally "And each man to his neighbor said"] "Who did this thing?" So they searched and inquired, and they said, "Gideon son of Jehoash did this thing."

###### v30
And the men of the city said to Jehoash, "Bring out your son so that he may die, for he has pulled down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah that _was_ beside it."

###### v31
But Jehoash said to all who stood against him, ^[Or "who arrayed against him"] "Will you contend for Baal? Will you rescue him? Whoever contends for him will be put to death by the morning. If he _is_ a god, let him contend for himself because _his altar has been pulled down_." ^[Literally "because he has pulled down his altar"; the subject in Hebrew has not been specified]

###### v32
Thus, on that day he ^[That is, Gideon] was called Jerub-Baal, _which means_, ^[Literally "saying"] "Let Baal contend against him," because he had pulled down his altar.

###### v33
Then all the Midianites, ^[Hebrew "Midianite"] Amalekites, ^[Hebrew "Amalekite"] and the people of _the_ east gathered together and crossed _the Jordan_; and they camped in the valley of Jezreel.

###### v34
So the Spirit of Yahweh _took possession of_ ^[Literally "clothed"] Gideon, and he blew on the trumpet, and _the_ Abiezrites ^[Hebrew "Abiezerite"] were called to follow him.

###### v35
He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they were also called to follow him; and he sent messengers throughout Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them.

###### v36
Then Gideon said to God, "In order to see that you will deliver Israel by my hand, just as you have said,

###### v37
I will place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and all of the ground _is_ dry, I will know that you will deliver Israel by my hand, just as you have said."

###### v38
And it was so. He arose early the next day and squeezed the fleece, and he wrung out dew from the fleece, a full drinking bowl of water.

###### v39
And Gideon said to God, "_Do not let your anger burn_ ^[Literally "Do not let your nose become hot"] against me; let me speak once more. Please let me test once more with the fleece; let the fleece be dry, and let there be dew on the ground."

###### v40
And God did so that night; only the fleece was dry, and dew was on all the ground.
