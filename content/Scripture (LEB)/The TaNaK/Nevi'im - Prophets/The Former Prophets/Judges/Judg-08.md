###### v1
The men of Ephraim said to him, "What _is_ this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight against the Midianites?" ^[Hebrew "Midianite"] And they quarreled with him severely.

###### v2
And he said to them, "What I have done now in comparison with you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?

###### v3
God has given into your hand the commanders of Midian, Oreb, and Zeeb. What have I been able to do in comparison with you?" And their _anger_ ^[Literally "spirit"] against him subsided when _he said that_. ^[Literally "he said this thing/word"]

###### v4
Then Gideon came to the Jordan, crossing it with the three hundred men who _were_ with him, weary and pursuing.

###### v5
He said to the men of Succoth, "Please give loaves of bread to the people who _are_ _following me_, ^[Literally "at my feet"] for they _are_ weary, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."

###### v6
The officials of Succoth said, "Is the hand ^[Or "palm"] of Zebah and Zalmunna in your hand now, that we should give bread to your army?"

###### v7
Gideon said, "Well then, when Yahweh gives Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will trample your flesh with the thorns and briers of the wilderness."

###### v8
He went from there _to_ Penuel, and he spoke similarly to them; and the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth answered.

###### v9
And he said also to the men of Penuel, saying, "When I return _safely_, ^[Literally "in peace"] I will tear down this tower."

###### v10
Now Zebah and Zalmunna _were_ in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men remained from the entire army ^[Or "camp"] of the people of _the_ east; those that fell _in battle were_ one hundred and twenty thousand _swordsmen_. ^[Literally "sword-drawing men"]

###### v11
And Gideon went up the route of those who dwell in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he attacked the army ^[Or "camp"] when it was off its guard. ^[Or "unsuspecting"]

###### v12
And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he routed ^[Or "he frightened" or "he threw into panic"] the entire army. ^[Or "camp"]

###### v13
Then Gideon son of Jehoash returned from the battle _by way of_ ^[Literally "from"] the ascent of Heres. ^[Or "pass of Heres"]

###### v14
He captured a young man _from Succoth_ ^[Literally "from the men of Succoth"] and questioned him. _The young man_ listed ^[Or "wrote down"] for him the commanders of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men.

###### v15
He came to the men of Succoth, and he said, "Here _is_ Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, '_Is_ the palm ^[Or "hand"] of Zebah and Zalmunna in your hand now, that we should give food to your weary men?'"

###### v16
He took the elders of the city and _the_ thorn bushes and briers of the wilderness, and _he trampled_ ^[Literally "he taught," but see v. [[Judg-08#v7|7]]] the men of Succoth with them.

###### v17
He broke down the tower of Penuel, and he killed the men of the city.

###### v18
And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "What type _were_ the men whom you killed at Tabor?" And they said, "_They were like you_; ^[Literally, "like you, like them"] each _one of them_ had the appearance of the sons of the king."

###### v19
He said, "They _were_ my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Yahweh lives, if you had kept them alive I would not kill you."

###### v20
And he said to Jether, his firstborn, "Get up, kill them." But the boy did not draw his sword, for he was afraid because he _was_ still a boy.

###### v21
Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Get up yourself, and strike us, for as _is_ the man, so _is_ his power." ^[Or "strength"] So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.

###### v22
The men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, both you and your sons, and your sons' son, for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.

###### v23
But Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; Yahweh will rule over you."

###### v24
And Gideon said to them, "_Let me make a request of you_, ^[Literally "Let me ask from you a request"] that each of you give to me an ornamental ring from his plunder." (They _had_ ornamental rings of gold, because they _were_ Ishmaelites.)

###### v25
They said, "We will gladly give _them_," and they spread out a garment, and everyone threw there an ornamental ring of his plunder.

###### v26
The weight of the ornamental rings of gold that he requested _was_ one thousand seven hundred _shekels of_ gold, apart from the crescents, pendants, and purple garments that _were_ on the kings of Midian, and apart from the pendants that _were_ on the necks of their camels.

###### v27
Gideon made an ephod _out of_ it, and he put it in his town in Ophrah, and all Israel prostituted _themselves_ to it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.
