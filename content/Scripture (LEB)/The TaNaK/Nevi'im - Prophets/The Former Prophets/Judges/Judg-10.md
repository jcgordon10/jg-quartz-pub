###### v1
After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah son of Dod, a man of Issachar, rose up to deliver Israel; and he _was_ living at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.

###### v2
And he judged Israel twenty-three years. And he died and was buried in Shamir.

###### v3
After him Jair the Gileadite rose up, and he judged Israel twenty-two years.

###### v4
And he had thirty sons who would ride on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty towns that _are_ in the land of Gilead that they called Havvoth Jair until this day.

###### v5
And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.

###### v6
And again, the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. They served the Baals, the Ashtaroth, the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, and the gods of the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] and Philistines; they abandoned Yahweh and did not serve him.

###### v7
And _the anger of Yahweh burned_ ^[Literally "the nose of Yahweh became hot"] against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of _the_ Philistines and the _Ammonites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"]

###### v8
They crushed and oppressed the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] in that year; for eighteen years they _crushed_ all the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] who _were_ beyond the Jordan, in the land of the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] which _is_ in Gilead.

###### v9
The _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim; and Israel was very distressed.

###### v10
Then the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] cried out to Yahweh, saying, "We have sinned against you; we have abandoned our God and served the Baals."

###### v11
And Yahweh said to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] "_Did I_ not _deliver you_ from _the_ Egyptians, ^[Hebrew "from Egypt"] the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] from the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] and from the Philistines? ^[Hebrew "Philistine"]

###### v12
And when _the_ Sidonians, _the_ Amalekites, ^[Hebrew "Amalekite"] and _the_ Maonites ^[Hebrew "Maonite"] oppressed you, you cried out to me, and I delivered you from their hand.

###### v13
Yet you have abandoned me and served other gods. Therefore I will no longer deliver you.

###### v14
Go and cry out to the gods whom you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your trouble."

###### v15
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] said to Yahweh, "We have sinned; _do to us accordingly as you see fit_; ^[Literally "do to us according to the good in your eyes"] only please deliver us this day."

###### v16
So they removed the foreign gods from their midst and served Yahweh; and _he could no longer bear_ ^[Literally "his soul was short with"] the misery of Israel.

###### v17
And the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] were summoned, ^[Or "were called to arms"] and they camped in Gilead. And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] gathered and camped at Mizpah.

###### v18
The people, the ones commanding Gilead, _said to each other_, ^[Literally "said each to his neighbor"] "Who _is_ the man that will begin to fight against the _Ammonites_? ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] He will be as head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
