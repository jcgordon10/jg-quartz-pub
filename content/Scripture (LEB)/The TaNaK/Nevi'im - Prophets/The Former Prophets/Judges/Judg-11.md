###### v1
Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior; he was the son of a prostitute, and _Gilead was his father_. ^[Literally "Gilead fathered Jephthah"]

###### v2
Gilead's wife also bore for him sons; and the sons of _his_ wife grew up and drove Jephthah away, and they said to him, "You will not inherit the house of our father because you _are_ the son of another woman."

###### v3
So Jephthah fled from the presence of his brothers, and he lived in the land of Tob. And _outlaws_ ^[Literally "unprincipled/worthless men"] gathered around Jephthah and went with him.

###### v4
After a time the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] made war with Israel.

###### v5
When the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] made war with Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob.

###### v6
And they said to Jephthah, "Come and be our commander, so that we may make war against the _Ammonites_." ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"]

###### v7
Jephthah said to the elders, "Did you not shun me and drive me out from the house of my father? Why do you come to me now when you have trouble?"

###### v8
And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "That being so, we have now returned to you, that you may go with us _to fight_ ^[Literally "to make war"] against the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] and become for us as head of all the inhabitants of Gilead."

###### v9
So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you bring me back _to fight_ ^[Literally "to make war"] against the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] and Yahweh gives them _over to me_, ^[Literally "before me"] will I be your head?"

###### v10
And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "Yahweh will be a _witness_ ^[Literally "hearer"] between us; we will act according to your word."

###### v11
So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them. And Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh at Mizpah.

###### v12
And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] saying, "What _is between_ you and me that you have come to me to make war against my land?"

###### v13
And the king of the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] said to Jephthah's messengers, "Because Israel took my land from _the_ Arnon up to the Jabbok and the Jordan when they came up from Egypt; so then, restore it peacefully."

###### v14
Once again Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"]

###### v15
and he said to him, "Thus says Jephthah, 'Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"]

###### v16
because when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the _Red Sea_ ^[Literally "sea of reed"] and went to Kadesh.

###### v17
Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, "Please let us cross through your land," but the king of Edom would not listen. And they also sent _messengers_ to the king of Moab, but he was not willing. So Israel stayed in Kadesh.

###### v18
Then they traveled through the wilderness, went around the land of Edom and Moab, and came to _the east_ ^[Literally "_from_ rise of sun"] side of the land of Moab, and they ^[Hebrew "he"] encamped beyond _the_ Arnon; and they did not go into the territory of Moab because _the_ Arnon _was_ the border of Moab.

###### v19
Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, 'Please let us cross through your land _to our country_.' ^[Literally "to our place"]

###### v20
But Sihon did not trust Israel to cross through his territory, so Sihon gathered all his people and then encamped at Jahaz; and he made war with Israel.

###### v21
And Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them; and Israel occupied all the land of the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] inhabiting that land.

###### v22
They occupied all the territory of the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] from _the_ Arnon up to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness up to the Jordan.

###### v23
So then Yahweh, the God of Israel, has driven out the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] from before his people Israel, and you want to possess it?

###### v24
Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gave you to possess? Whoever Yahweh our God has driven out before us, we will possess it.

###### v25
So then, _are_ you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel, or did he ever make war against them?

###### v26
When Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the towns that _are_ _along the Arnon_, ^[Literally "on the hands of the Arnon"] for three hundred years, ^[Hebrew "year"] why did you not recover _them_ at that time?

###### v27
I have not sinned against you; but you _are_ the one who is doing wrong by making war against me. _Let Yahweh judge_ ^[Literally "Let Yahweh the judge, judge"] today between the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and the _Ammonites_." ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"]

###### v28
But the king of the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] did not listen to the message that Jephthah sent to him.

###### v29
And the Spirit of Yahweh came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh. He passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed through _to_ the _Ammonites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"]

###### v30
And Jephthah made a vow to Yahweh, and he said, "If indeed you will give the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] into my hand,

###### v31
whatever ^[Or "whoever"] comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return safely from the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] will be Yahweh's, and I will offer it _as_ a burnt offering."

###### v32
And Jephthah crossed _over_ to the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] to make war against them; and Yahweh gave them into his hand.

###### v33
And he defeated them _with_ a very great blow, from Aroer as far as Minnith, twenty towns, ^[Hebrew "town"] up to Abel Keramim. And the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] were subdued before the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v34
Jephthah came to Mizpah, to his house, and behold his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and dancing. She _was_ his only child; he did not have a son or daughter except her.

###### v35
And the moment he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, "Ah! My daughter, you have caused me to bow down, and you have become my trouble. _I made an oath_ ^[Literally "I have opened wide my mouth"] to Yahweh, and I cannot take _it_ back."

###### v36
She said to him, "My father, _you made an oath_ ^[Literally "you have opened wide your mouth"] to Yahweh. Do to me according to what has gone out from your mouth, since Yahweh gave vengeance to you against your enemies, the _Ammonites_." ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"]

###### v37
And she said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me: grant me two months so that I may go wander ^[Hebrew "down"] on the mountains and lament over my virginity, I and my companions.

###### v38
And he said, "Go." He sent her away _for_ two months, and she went with her friends, and she lamented over her virginity on the mountains.

###### v39
At the end of the two months she returned to her father, and he did to her _according to_ his vow; and _she did not sleep with a man_. ^[Literally "she did not know a man"] And it became an annual custom in Israel

###### v40
for the daughters of Israel to go and lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for forty days of the year.
