###### v1
The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed _over_ to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross _over_ and make war against the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] and why did you not call us to go with you? We will burn down your house over you with fire."

###### v2
And Jephthah said to them, "I and my people were engaged in great conflict with the _Ammonites_; ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] I called you, but you did not deliver me from their hand.

###### v3
I saw that you would not deliver _us_; _I risked my own life_, ^[Literally "I put my life in my hand"] and I crossed _over_ to the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] and Yahweh gave them into my hand. Why have you come up to me this day to fight against me?"

they said to him, "Please say Shibboleth," and _if_ he said, "Sibboleth"--because he could not _pronounce it_ ^[Literally "speak it"] correctly--they grabbed him and executed him at the fords of Jordan. At that time forty-two thousand from Ephraim fell.
