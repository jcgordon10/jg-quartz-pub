###### v1
And again, the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh gave them into the hand of _the_ Philistines forty years.

###### v2
There was a certain man from Zorah, from the tribe of the Danites, and his name _was_ Manoah; his wife _was_ infertile and did not bear children.

###### v3
And an angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman, and he said to her, "Behold, you _are_ infertile and have not borne _children_, but you will conceive and bear a son.

###### v4
So then, be careful and do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean,

###### v5
because you _will_ conceive and bear a son. No razor _will touch_ ^[Literally "will go upon"] his head, because the boy will be a _Nazirite of God_ ^[Literally "consecrated of God" or "devoted of God"] _from birth_. ^[Literally "from the womb"] And it is he who will begin to deliver Israel from _the_ hand of _the_ Philistines."

###### v6
And the woman came and told her husband, saying, "A man of God came to me, and his appearance _was_ like the appearance of an angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him from where he _came_, and he did not tell me his name.

###### v7
And he said to me, 'Look, you _will_ conceive and bear a son, so then, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, for the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth ^[Or "the womb"] until the day of his death.'"

###### v8
Then Manoah prayed to Yahweh and said, "Excuse me, my Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent again come to us and teach us what we should do concerning the boy who will be born."

###### v9
And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and an angel of God came again to the woman; she _was_ sitting in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her.

###### v10
The woman quickly ran and told her husband, and she said to him, "Look! The man who came to me the _other_ day appeared to me."

###### v11
So Manoah got up and went after his wife, and he came to the man and said to him, "_Are_ you the man that spoke to the woman?" And he said, "I _am_."

###### v12
And Manoah said to him, "Now _when your words come true_, ^[Literally "when your words will come"] what will be the boy's _manner of life_ ^[Literally "measure"] and work?"

###### v13
And the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, "Let the woman be attentive to all that I said.

###### v14
She should not eat of anything that comes from the vine, or drink wine or strong drink, or eat anything unclean; she should keep all that I commanded."

###### v15
And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, "_Please stay_, ^[Literally "Please, let us hold you back"] and let us prepare a _young goat_ ^[Literally "kid of goat"] for you."

###### v16
The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, "If you keep me, I will not eat your food, but if you prepare a burnt offering for Yahweh, you can offer it (for Manoah did not know that he _was_ an angel of Yahweh)."

###### v17
And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, "What _is_ your name so that when your words come _true_ we may honor you?"

###### v18
But the angel of Yahweh said to him, "Why do you ask my name? It _is too_ wonderful."

###### v19
And Manoah took the _young goat_ ^[Literally "kid of goat"] and the grain offering, and he offered _it_ to Yahweh on the rock, to the one who performs miracles. ^[Or "the one who works wonders"] And Manoah and his wife _were_ watching.

###### v20
And when the flame went up toward the heaven from the altar, the angel of Yahweh went up in the flame of the altar to heaven while Manoah and his wife _were_ watching. And they fell on their faces to the ground.

###### v21
The angel of Yahweh did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, and then Manoah knew that he _was_ a messenger ^[Or "angel"] of Yahweh.

###### v22
And Manoah said to his wife, "We will certainly die because we have seen God."

###### v23
But his wife said to him, "If Yahweh wanted to kill us he would not have taken ^[Or "accepted"] from our hand the burnt offering and the grain offering, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us things such as these."

###### v24
The woman bore a son, and she called him Samson; the boy grew big, and Yahweh blessed him.

###### v25
And the Spirit of Yahweh began to stir him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
