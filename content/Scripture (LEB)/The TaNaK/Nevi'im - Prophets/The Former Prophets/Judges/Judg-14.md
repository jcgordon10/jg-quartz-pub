###### v1
And Samson went down to Timnah, and he saw a woman in Timnah from the daughters of the Philistines.

###### v2
He went up and told his father and mother, and he said, "I saw a woman in Timnah from the daughters of _the_ Philistines; so then, take her for me as a wife."

###### v3
But his father and mother said to him, "Is there not a wife among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our ^[Hebrew "my"] people, that you must take a wife from _the_ uncircumcised Philistines?" But Samson said to his father, "Take her for me because _she pleases me_." ^[Literally "she is right in my eyes"]

###### v4
His father and mother did not know that this _was_ from Yahweh; he was seeking for an occasion against _the_ Philistines. Now at that time _the_ Philistines _were_ ruling ^[Or "having control"] in Israel.

###### v5
And Samson and his father and mother went down to Timnah, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah, and suddenly a young lion _came_ roaring to meet him.

###### v6
And the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one might tear apart a male kid goat (_he was bare-handed_). ^[Literally "there was nothing in his hand"] But he did not tell his father and mother what he had done.

###### v7
Then he went down and talked to the woman, and _she pleased Samson_. ^[Literally "she did what was right in the eyes of Samson"]

###### v8
And he returned after awhile _to marry her_, ^[Literally "to take her"] and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and there _was_ a swarm of wild honey bees in the body of the lion, and honey.

###### v9
He scraped it out into his hands, and he went on, eating _it_ as he went. And he went to his father and mother and gave _some_ to them, and they ate it. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the body of the lion.

###### v10
His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared there a feast, as young men were accustomed to doing this.

###### v11
When they saw him, they took thirty companions, and they were with him.

###### v12
And Samson said to them, "Let me tell you a riddle. If you can fully explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find _it out_, I will give to you thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments.

###### v13
But if you are unable to explain it to me, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments." So they said to him, "Tell your riddle; let us hear it."

###### v14
He said to them,
"From the eater came out food,
From _the_ strong came out sweet."
But they were unable to explain the riddle for three days.

###### v15
When it was the fourth ^[Hebrew "seventh"; other ancient translations have "fourth"] day, they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband and tell us the riddle, or we will burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you invited us to rob us?"

###### v16
And Samson's wife wept before him, and she said, "You must hate me; you do not love me. You told the riddle to _my people_, ^[Literally "the sons/children of my people"] but you have not explained _it_ to me." He said to her, "I have not explained _it_ to my father and mother. _Why_ should I explain it to you?"

###### v17
She wept before him the seven days of their feast; and it happened, because she nagged him, on the seventh day he explained _it_ to her, and she told the riddle to _her people_. ^[Literally "the sons/children of her people"]

###### v18
The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went _down_,
"What _is_ sweeter than honey?
What _is_ stronger than a lion?"
And he said to them,
"If you had not plowed with my heifer,
you would not have found out my riddle."

###### v19
And the Spirit of Yahweh rushed on him, and he went down to Ashkelon. He killed thirty men from them, and he took their belongings, and he gave festal garments to the ones that explained the riddle. _He was angry_, ^[Literally "his nose was hot"] and he went up to his father's house.

###### v20
And Samson's wife was _given_ to his companion who _was_ his best man. ^[Or "friend"]
