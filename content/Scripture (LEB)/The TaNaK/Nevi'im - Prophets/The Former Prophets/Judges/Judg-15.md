###### v1
After a while, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a _young goat_. ^[Literally "kid of goat"] He said, "I want to go to my wife's private room." But her father would not allow him to enter.

###### v2
Her father said, "I really thought that you hated her, so I gave her to your companion. _Is_ not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please, _take her instead_." ^[Literally "let her be in the place of her"]

###### v3
And Samson said to them, "This time, as far as the Philistines are concerned, when I do something evil I am without blame."

###### v4
And Samson went and captured three hundred foxes, and he took torches. He turned _them_ tail to tail, and he put one torch between two tails.

###### v5
He set fire to the torches and let _the foxes_ go into the standing grain of _the_ Philistines, and he burned both the stacks ^[Hebrew "stack"] of sheaves and the standing grain, up to the vineyards ^[Hebrew "vineyard"] of olive groves.

###### v6
And _the_ Philistines said, "Who has done this?" And they said, "Samson the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion." And _the_ Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire.

###### v7
Samson said to them, "If you want to behave like this, _I swear_ I will not rest unless I have taken revenge on you."

###### v8
And _he gave them a thorough beating_, ^[Literally "he struck them hip and thigh _with_ a great blow"] and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.

###### v9
Then _the_ Philistines came up and encamped in Judah, and they overran Lehi.

###### v10
And the men of Judah said, "Why have you come up against us?" And they said, "To bind Samson; to do to him just as he did to us."

###### v11
Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and they said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines _are_ ruling over us? What _is_ this _that_ you have done to us?" And he said to them, "Just as they did to me, so I have done to them."

###### v12
They said to him, "We have come down to bind you and give you over into the hand of _the_ Philistines." And Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves."

###### v13
They said to him, "No, we will only bind you and give you into their hand; we will certainly not kill you." So they bound him with two new ropes, and they brought him up from the rock.

###### v14
As he came up to Lehi, _the_ Philistines came shouting to meet him; and the Spirit of Yahweh rushed on him, and the ropes that _were_ on his arms became like flax that has burned with fire, and his bindings melted from his hands.

###### v15
And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey; he reached down and took it and killed one thousand men with it.

###### v16
And Samson said,
"With the jawbone of the donkey,
heap upon heap;
with the jawbone of the donkey,
I struck dead one thousand men."

###### v17
And it happened, when he finished speaking he threw the jawbone from his hand; and he called that place Ramath Lehi. ^[That is, "Hill of the Jawbone"]

###### v18
And he was very thirsty, and he called to Yahweh and said, "You gave this great victory into the hand of your servant, but now I must die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?"

###### v19
So God split the hollow place that _is_ at Lehi, and water came out from it; and he drank, and his spirit returned, and he was revived. Thus he called its name _The Spring of Ha-Qore_, ^[Literally "the spring of the one who called" or "En-hakkore"] which _is_ at Lehi to this day.

###### v20
And he judged Israel in the days of _the_ Philistines twenty years.
