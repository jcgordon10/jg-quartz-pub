###### v1
Samson went down to Gaza; there he saw a prostitute and _had sex with her_. ^[Literally "went into her"]

###### v2
The Gazites _were told_, "Samson has come here," so they surrounded _the place_ and lay in ambush for him all night at the city gate. They kept silent all night, saying, "_We will wait_ until the morning light, and then we will kill him."

###### v3
But Samson lay until the middle of the night; he got up in the middle of the night and took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two door posts, tore them loose with the bar, put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the hill that is _in front of_ ^[Literally "on the face of"] Hebron.

###### v4
After this he fell in love _with_ a woman in the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Sorek, and her name _was_ Delilah.

###### v5
And the rulers of _the_ Philistines came up to her and said, "Entice him and find out what makes his strength so great, and how we can overpower him, so that we may bind him up in order to subdue him; each of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.

###### v6
So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me what makes your strength so great, and with what can you be tied up to subdue you?"

###### v7
Samson said to her, "If you tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that are not dried up, I will become weak like everyone else."

###### v8
So the rulers of _the_ Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that were not dried up, and she tied him up with them.

###### v9
The ambush _was_ sitting _in wait_ for her in an inner room. And she said to him, "_The_ Philistines _are_ upon you Samson!" And he snapped the bowstrings just as flax fiber snaps when it comes close to fire. And _the secret of_ his strength remained unknown.

###### v10
Delilah said to Samson, "Look, you have mocked me and told me lies. Please tell me how you can be bound."

###### v11
He said to her, "If they tie me tightly with new ropes that have not been used, I will become weak and be like everyone else."

###### v12
So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them, and she said to him, "_The_ Philistines _are_ upon you, Samson!" (The ambush _was_ sitting in an inner room.) But he snapped them from his arms like thread.

###### v13
And Delilah said to Samson, "Until now you have mocked me and told lies to me. Tell me how you can be bound." And he said to her, "If you weave seven locks of my head with warp-threads." ^[Many modern translations include an additional phrase found in the Greek translation: "and fasten it with a pin, then I will become weak and be like everyone else. So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them"]

###### v14
She fastened _it_ with the pin and said to him, "_The_ Philistines _are_ upon you, Samson!" And Samson woke up from his sleep and tore loose the loom pin of the web and the warp-threads. ^[Hebrew "warp-thread"]

###### v15
And she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and you have not told me how your strength is _so_ great."

###### v16
And because she nagged him day after day with her words, and pestered him, _his soul grew impatient to the point of death_. ^[Literally "his inner self grew tired/impatient to death"]

###### v17
So _he confided everything to her_, ^[Literally "he told her all his heart"] and he said to her, "A razor _has never touched_ ^[Literally "has never gone up"] my head, for I _am_ a _Nazirite of God_ ^[Literally "consecrated of God" or "devoted of God"] _from birth_. ^[Literally "from the womb of my mother"] If I am shaved my strength will leave me, and I will become weak, like everyone else.

###### v18
Delilah realized that _he had confided in her_, ^[Literally "he had told her all his heart"] so she sent and called the rulers of _the_ Philistines, saying, "Come up one more time, for _he has confided in me_." ^[Literally "he has told me all his heart"] And the rulers of _the_ Philistines came up, and they brought the money _with them_. ^[Literally "in their hand"]

###### v19
And she put him to sleep on her lap; then she called the men ^[Hebrew "man"] and shaved off seven locks of his head. Then she began to subdue him, ^[Or "humiliate him"] and his strength went away from him.

###### v20
And she said to him, "_The_ Philistines _are_ upon you, Samson!" And he woke up from his sleep and said, "I will go out just like every other time and shake myself free," but he did not know that Yahweh had left him.

###### v21
And _the_ Philistines seized him, gouged his eyes, and brought him to Gaza. They tied him up with bronze shackles, and he became a grinder _in the prison_. ^[Literally "in the house of the prisoners"]

###### v22
But the hair of his head began to grow back after it had been shaved off.

###### v23
The rulers of _the_ Philistines had gathered to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice. And they said, "Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand."

###### v24
And the people saw him, and they praised their god, for they said, "Our god has given into our hand those who hate us, devastate our land, and have _killed many of us_." ^[Literally "made numerous our slain"]

###### v25
After awhile, when their hearts ^[Hebrew "heart"] were merry, they said, "Call Samson and let him entertain us." And they called Samson _from the prison_, ^[Literally "from the house of the prisoner"] and _he entertained them_. ^[Literally "he made sport before them"] And they made him stand between the pillars.

###### v26
Then Samson said to the servant who was holding him by his hand, "Position me so that I can touch the pillars on which the house ^[Or "temple"] rests, so I can lean on them."

###### v27
And the house ^[Or "temple"] was full of men and women, and all of the rulers of _the_ Philistines _were_ there--about three thousand men and women were on the roof watching the performance of Samson.

###### v28
And Samson called to Yahweh and said, "My Lord Yahweh, remember me! Please give me strength this one time, O God, so that I can repay _with_ one act of revenge to _the_ Philistines for my eyes."

###### v29
And Samson reached out and held two of the middle pillars on which the house ^[Or "temple"] _was_ resting, and he leaned on them, one on his right and one on his left.

###### v30
And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." And he pushed ^[Or "he caused to bend"] with _all his_ strength, and the house ^[Or "temple"] fell on the rulers and all of the people who _were_ with him. And the dead whom he killed in his death were more than those he killed in his life.

###### v31
His brothers and _his whole family_ ^[Literally "all the house of his father"] came down and picked him up; and they brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father; he judged Israel twenty years.
