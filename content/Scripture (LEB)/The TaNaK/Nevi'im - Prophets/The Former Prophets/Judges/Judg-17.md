###### v1
There was a man from the hill country of Ephraim; his name _was_ Micah.

###### v2
And he said to his mother, "The eleven hundred _pieces_ of silver that were taken from you, and about which you also pronounced a curse _in my hearing_, ^[Literally "In my ears"] are with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son by Yahweh."

###### v3
He returned the eleven hundred pieces ^[Hebrew "piece"] of silver to his mother, and his mother thought, "I will certainly consecrate to Yahweh the pieces ^[Hebrew "piece"] of silver from my hand for my son to make an idol of cast metal; now then, I will return them ^[Hebrew "it"] to you."

###### v4
When he returned the pieces ^[Hebrew "piece"] of silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces ^[Hebrew "piece"] of silver, and she gave it to the smith, and he made it _into_ an idol of cast metal; and it was in the house of Micah.

###### v5
The man Micah had for himself _a shrine_, ^[Literally "a house of god"] and he made an ephod and teraphim, and _he appointed one of his sons_ ^[Literally "he filled the hand of one of his sons"] who became a priest for him.

###### v6
In those days there was no king in Israel, and each one did what was right in his own eyes.

###### v7
There was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, from the clan of Judah; he _was_ a Levite and _was_ dwelling as a foreigner ^[Or "alien"] there.

###### v8
And the man went from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to live as a foreigner ^[Or "alien"] wherever he could find _a place_. And he came _to_ the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, to continue his journey.

###### v9
And Micah said to him, "From where do you come?" And he said to him, "I _am_ a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah; I _am_ going to dwell as a foreigner ^[Or "alien"] wherever I can find _a place_."

###### v10
And Micah said to him, "Stay with me and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give to you ten pieces ^[Hebrew "piece"] of silver a year, a set of clothes, and your food." So the Levite went _with him_.

###### v11
The Levite agreed to stay with the man; and the young man became as one of his sons.

###### v12
So Micah _appointed the Levite_, ^[Literally "filled the hand of the Levite"] and the young man became a priest for him; and he was in the house of Micah.

###### v13
And Micah said, "Now I know Yahweh will make me prosperous, because the Levite has become my priest."
