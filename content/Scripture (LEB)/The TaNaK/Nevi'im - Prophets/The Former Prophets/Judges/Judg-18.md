###### v1
In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites _was_ seeking territory for itself to live in, because until that day it had not been allotted territory among the tribes of Israel.

###### v2
The descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Dan sent from the whole number of their clan five _capable men_ ^[Literally "sons of physical strength"] from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and to explore it. And they said to them, "Go, explore the land." And they went to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and they spent the night there. ^[Or "they lodged there"]

###### v3
While they _were_ with the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite, and they turned aside there and said to him, "Who brought you here? What _are_ you doing in this place, and _what is your business here_?" ^[Literally "What is for you here?"]

###### v4
And he said to them, "Micah did such and such for me and hired me, and I became his priest."

###### v5
And they said to him, "Please inquire of God that we may know whether our journey that we _are_ going on will be successful."

###### v6
And the priest said to them, "Go in peace. Yahweh _is_ in front of you on the journey you want to go on."

###### v7
And the five men went and came to Laish, and they observed the people who _were_ living according to the customs of _the_ Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, and lacking nothing in the land, and possessing restraint. ^[Or perhaps "prosperity"; the Hebrew of this word is uncertain] And they _were_ far from _the_ Sidonians and had no word with anyone.

###### v8
They came to their relatives ^[Or "brothers"] _at_ Zorah and Eshtaol, and their relatives ^[Or "brothers"] said to them, "What _do_ you _report_?"

###### v9
And they said to them, "Come, let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and _it is_ very good. Will you do nothing? Do not hesitate to go, to enter, to possess the land.

###### v10
When you go you will come to an unsuspecting people, and the land _is spread out on all sides_; ^[Literally "_is_ wide of hands"] God has given a place into your hands where there is no lack of anything that _is_ on the earth."

###### v11
Six hundred men from the clan of the Danites from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed _with_ weapons of war, set out from there.

###### v12
They went up and encamped at Kiriath Jearim in Judah. Therefore they called this place Camp of Dan ^[That is "Mahaneh-dan"] to this day; it is west of Kiriath Jearim.

###### v13
From there they crossed _over to_ the hill country of Ephraim, and they came to the house of Micah.

###### v14
And the five men that went out to spy out the land (_that is_, Laish) responded and said to their relatives, ^[Or "brothers"] "Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod, teraphim, and an idol of cast metal? So then, consider what you must do."

###### v15
So they turned to that direction, and they came to the house of the young Levite, the house of Micah, and _they greeted him_. ^[Literally "they asked for him in peace"]

###### v16
And six hundred men from the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Dan, armed _with_ their weapons of war, _were_ standing _at_ the entrance of the gate.

###### v17
And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and they entered there _and_ took the carved divine image, ephod, teraphim, and the molten image. The priest _was_ standing _at_ the entrance of the gate _with_ the six hundred men armed _with_ the weapons of war.

###### v18
When these went to Micah's house, they took the divine carved image, ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, and the priest asked them, "What _are_ you doing?"

###### v19
And they said to him, "Keep quiet! Put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be for us a father and a priest. Is it better being a priest for a house of one man or being a priest for a tribe and clan in Israel?"

###### v20
_The priest accepted the offer_, ^[Literally "It was good in the heart of the priest"] and he took the ephod, teraphim, and molten image and went along with the people.

###### v21
And they turned ^[Or "resumed their journey"] and went and put the little children, the livestock, and the valuable property in front of them.

###### v22
When they were at a distance from the house, Micah and the men who _were_ in the houses that _were_ near the house of Micah cried out, and they overtook the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Dan.

###### v23
And they called to the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Dan, who turned around to face them, and they said to Micah, "What is the matter with you that you assembled together?"

###### v24
He said, "You took away my gods that I had made, and the priest, and then you go _away_. What _is_ now left for me? How can you say to me, 'What is the matter?'"

###### v25
And the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Dan said to him, "You should not let your voice be heard among us, so that _ill-tempered men_ ^[Literally "men of bitter soul"] _will not attack you_, ^[Literally "will not fall on you"] _and take your life_ ^[Literally "and you will lose your life"] and the lives of your household."

###### v26
And the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Dan went their way. When Micah saw that they _were_ stronger than him, he turned to return to his house.

###### v27
And they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and they came to Laish, to a quiet and unsuspecting people, and _they put them to the sword_ ^[Literally "they put them to _the_ mouth of _the_ sword"] and burned the city with fire.

###### v28
There was no deliverer, because it _was_ far from Sidon, and _they had had no dealings with anyone_. ^[Literally "a thing was not for them with anyone"] It _was_ in the valley that belonged to Beth-rehob, and they rebuilt ^[Hebrew "built"] the city and lived in it.

###### v29
And they called the name of the city Dan, after Dan their ancestor, ^[Or "father"] who was born to Israel; but the former name of the city _was_ Laish.

###### v30
And the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Dan set up for themselves the carved divine image, and Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Manasseh, ^[Other ancient versions read "Moses"] he and his sons were priests for the tribe of the Danites until the time of the captivity of the land.

###### v31
So they set up for themselves the carved divine image that Micah had made, all the days that the house of God _was_ in Shiloh.
