###### v1
In those days there was no king in Israel; there was a man, a Levite, who dwelled as a foreigner ^[Or "alien"] in the remote areas of the hill country of Ephraim. And he took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.

###### v2
But his concubine felt repugnance toward him, ^[Other modern translations read "his concubine played the harlot against him"] and she left him and went to her father's house, to Bethlehem in Judah; she was there some four months.

###### v3
So her husband set out, and he went after her to speak _tenderly to her_, ^[Literally "to her heart"] to bring her back. He took with him his servant and a pair of donkeys. And she brought him _to_ her father's house, and the father of the young woman saw him and was glad to meet him.

###### v4
His father-in-law, the young woman's father, urged him to stay with him three days; and they ate and drank, and they spent the night there.

###### v5
On the fourth day, they rose early in the morning, and he prepared to go, but the father of the young woman said to his son-in-law, "_Refresh yourself_ ^[Literally "Refresh your heart"] _with_ a bit of food, and afterward you may go."

###### v6
So the two of them sat and ate and drank together, and the father of the young woman said to the man, "Please, agree to spend the night and _enjoy yourself_." ^[Literally "and let your heart be good"]

###### v7
The man got up to go, but his father-in-law urged him, and he returned and spent the night there.

###### v8
On the fifth day he rose early in the morning to go, and the father of the young woman said, "Please, _enjoy yourself_," ^[Literally "and let your heart be good"] and they lingered until the day declined, and the two of them ate.

###### v9
And the man got up to go--he, his concubine, and his servant--but his father-in-law, the father of the young woman, said to him, "Please, the day has worn on to evening; please, spend the night, the day has drawn to a close. Spend the night here and _enjoy yourself_. ^[Literally "and let your heart be good"] You can rise early tomorrow for your journey and _go to your home_." ^[Literally "go to your tent"]

###### v10
But the man was not willing to spend the night, and he got up and went; and he arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). _He had_ with him a pair of saddled donkeys and his concubine.

###### v11
They _were_ near Jebus, and _the day was far spent_, ^[Literally "the day went down very"] and the servant said to his master, "Please, come, let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites, ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"] and let us spend the night in it."

###### v12
But his master said to him, "We will not turn aside to the city of foreigners, ^[Hebrew "foreigner"] who _are_ not from the _Israelites_; ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] we will cross over up to Gibeah."

###### v13
And he said to his servant, "Come, let us approach one of these places; we will spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah."

###### v14
So they crossed over and went their way, and the sun went down on them beside Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.

###### v15
And they turned aside there to enter _and_ to spend the night at Gibeah. And they went and sat in the open square of the city, but no one _took them in to spend the night_. ^[Literally "was receiving them to _their_ house to spend the night"]

###### v16
Then behold, an old man _was_ coming from his work from the field in the evening, and the man _was_ from the hill country of Ephraim, and he _was_ dwelling as a foreigner ^[Or "alien"] in Gibeah. (The people of the place _were_ descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin.)

###### v17
And the old man raised his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city, and he said, "Where are you going, and from where do you come?"

###### v18
And he said to him, "We _are_ crossing over from Bethlehem in Judah up to the remote areas of the hill country of Ephraim, where I _am_ from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, but _now_ I am going to Yahweh's house, ^[Or "my house," according to the LXX and some modern translations (NASB, NRSV)] but no one _took me in to spend the night_. ^[Literally "was receiving me to _their_ house"]

###### v19
There is both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, for your servant, ^[That is, the concubine] and for the young man who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything."

###### v20
And the old man said, "Peace to you. I will take care of your needs; however, you must not spend the night in the open square."

###### v21
So he brought him to his house, and he fed the donkeys; they washed their feet, ate, and drank.

###### v22
While _they were enjoying themselves_, ^[Literally "their hearts _were_ being good"] behold, the men of the city, _the perverse lot_, ^[Literally "sons of uselessness"] surrounded the house, pounding on the door. And they said to the old man, the owner of the house, "Bring out the man who came to your house so that _we may have sex with him_." ^[Literally "we may know him"]

###### v23
So the man, the owner of the house, went out to them and said to them, "No, my brothers, do not act wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not do this disgraceful thing.

###### v24
Here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. Please, let me bring them out; do violence to them, ^[Or "rape them"] and do to them _whatever you please_. ^[Literally "the good in your eyes"] Do not do this disgraceful thing to this man."

###### v25
But the men were not willing to listen to him, and the man seized his concubine and brought _her_ out to them; and they had intercourse with her, and they abused her all night until the morning; they let her go at the approach of dawn.

###### v26
And the woman came as the morning appeared, and she fell _at_ the entrance of the man's house where her master was, until daylight. ^[Hebrew "light"]

###### v27
In the morning her master got up, and he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his journey, and behold, his concubine _was_ falling ^[Or "spread out"] _at_ the entrance of the house, with her hand on the threshold.

###### v28
And he said to her, "Get up, let us go," but there was no answer. So he put her on the donkey, and the man got up and went to his place.

###### v29
When he entered his house he took a knife, and he grasped his concubine and cut her into twelve pieces; and he sent her throughout the whole territory of Israel.

###### v30
All who saw _it_ said, "Nothing like this has _ever_ been since the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] went up from the land of Egypt until this day. Take note of it, consider _it_, and speak _up_."
