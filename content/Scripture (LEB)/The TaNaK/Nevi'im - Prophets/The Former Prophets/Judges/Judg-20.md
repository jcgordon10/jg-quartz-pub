###### v1
All the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] went out, from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, and they gathered as one body ^[Hebrew "man"] to Yahweh _at_ Mizpah.

###### v2
And the leaders of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand sword-bearing infantry.

###### v3
(The descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin heard that the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] had gone up _to_ Mizpah.) And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons of Israel" or "children of "Israel"] said, "Tell us, how did this evil act occur?"

###### v4
The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered and said, "I came to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night.

###### v5
The lords of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me, and they raped my concubine, and she died.

###### v6
Then I grabbed my concubine and cut her into pieces, and I sent her throughout all the territory of Israel's inheritance; for they committed a shameful and disgraceful thing in Israel.

###### v7
Look, all you _Israelites_! ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] _Make your decision_ ^[Literally "give your word"] and advice here."

###### v8
All the people got up as one body, ^[Hebrew "man"] saying, "Not one of us will go to his tent, or will any of us return to his house.

###### v9
So then, this is what we will do to Gibeah: _we will go up_ against her by lot.

###### v10
We will take ten men of one hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and one thousand of ten thousand, to bring provisions to the troops, to repay _them_ when they come to Gibeah ^[Hebrew "Geba"] of Benjamin for all the disgraceful things ^[Hebrew "thing"] they did in Israel."

###### v11
And all the men of Israel were gathered to the city as one body ^[Hebrew "man"] united.

###### v12
Then the tribes of Israel sent men throughout all the tribes of Benjamin, saying, "What _is_ this wickedness that happened among you?

###### v13
So then, hand over the men, _the perverse lot_, ^[Literally "sons of uselessness"] who _are_ in Gibeah, so that we may kill them and purge _this_ wickedness from Israel." But the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin were not willing to listen to the voice of their relatives, ^[Or "brothers"] the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v14
And the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin were gathered from the cities to Gibeah to go out for battle against the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v15
From the cities the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin were counted on that day twenty-six thousand _sword-wielding men_, ^[Literally "men drawing sword"] besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were counted seven hundred well-trained ^[Or "chosen"] men.

###### v16
From all these troops _were_ seven hundred well-trained ^[Or "choice/chosen"] men _who were left-handed_; ^[Literally "bound _by_ his right hand"] each one could sling with a stone at a hair and not miss.

###### v17
And the men of Israel besides Benjamin were counted four hundred thousand _sword-wielding men_; ^[Literally "men drawing sword"] _all were warriors_. ^[Literally "all were men of war"]

###### v18
Then the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] got up and went up _to_ Bethel, and they inquired of God, saying, "Who will go up first for the battle against the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin?" And Yahweh said, "Judah _will go_ first."

###### v19
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] got up in the morning, and they encamped against Gibeah.

###### v20
Then the men of Israel marched out for the battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel took up positions against them _for_ battle at Gibeah.

###### v21
The descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin went out from Gibeah, and they struck down on that day twenty-two thousand men of Israel to the ground.

###### v22
But the troops, the men of Israel, _encouraged themselves_, ^[Literally "took heart"] and again they arranged _their_ battle _lines_ in the place where they had arranged themselves the first day.

###### v23
The _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] went up and wept before Yahweh until evening and inquired of Yahweh, saying, "Should we again draw near from the battle against the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin, our relatives?" ^[Hebrew "my brother"] And Yahweh said, "Go up against them." ^[Hebrew "him"]

###### v24
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] drew near to the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin on the second day.

###### v25
And Benjamin went out from Gibeah to meet them on the second day, and they struck down the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] again, eighteen thousand men to the ground; all of these _were_ _sword-wielding_. ^[Literally "drawers of sword"]

###### v26
And all the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and all the troops went up and came to Bethel and wept; and they sat there before Yahweh and fasted on that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before Yahweh.

###### v27
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] inquired of Yahweh (In those days the ark of the covenant of God _was_ there,

###### v28
and Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, _was_ standing _before it_ ^[Literally "before presence of it/him"] _to minister_ in those days), saying, "Should we go out once more to battle against the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin our relatives, ^[Hebrew "my brother"] or should we stop?" And Yahweh said, "Go up tomorrow; I will give them ^[Hebrew "him"] into your hand."

###### v29
So Israel stationed an ambush all around Gibeah.

###### v30
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] went up against the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin on the third day, and they took up positions against Gibeah as before.

###### v31
The descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin went out to meet the troops, and they lured _them_ away from the city and began to inflict casualties on the troops as before, on the main road, one of which goes up _to_ Bethel, the other to Gibeah; _and_ in the field _there were_ about thirty men of Israel.

###### v32
And the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin thought, ^[Or "said"] "They _are_ being defeated before us _as previously_," ^[Literally "on the first"] and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] said, "Let us flee and lure them ^[Hebrew "him"] away from the city to the main roads."

###### v33
And all the men of Israel got up from their places ^[Hebrew "place"] and took up positions in Baal Tamar; and the ambush of Israel charged from their places, ^[Hebrew "place"] from the vicinity of Gibeah. ^[Hebrew "Geba"]

###### v34
Then ten thousand well-trained ^[Or "choice/chosen"] men from all Israel came out against Gibeah, and the battle became fierce; ^[Or "the battle became heavy"] they did not know that disaster _was about to_ _close in_ ^[Literally "touching"] on them.

###### v35
And Yahweh defeated Benjamin in the presence of Israel, and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] destroyed on that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men of Benjamin, all of them _sword-wielding_. ^[Literally "drawing sword"]

###### v36
The descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin saw that they were defeated, and the men of Israel gave ground ^[Or "a place" or "space"] to Benjamin because they trusted the ambush that they had set against Gibeah.

###### v37
And the ambush came quickly and advanced against Gibeah, and it _put the whole city to the sword_. ^[Literally "struck the whole city with _the_ mouth of _the_ sword"]

###### v38
Now the appointed time for the men of Israel with the ambush was that they sent up for them a great amount of smoke from the city.

###### v39
And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to inflict casualties on about thirty men of Israel because they thought, ^[Or "said"] "They will be completely defeated before us as in the first battle."

###### v40
And the cloud of smoke began to go up from the city in a column of smoke, and Benjamin turned backward, and behold, the whole city was going up _in smoke_! ^[Literally "to heaven"]

###### v41
And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed because they saw that disaster was _closing in_ ^[Literally "touching"] on them.

###### v42
And they retreated from before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness, but the battle caught up to them, and _those_ who _came_ from the cities ^[Other ancient translations "city"] destroyed them in the midst of them.

###### v43
They surrounded Benjamin; they pursued them ^[Hebrew "him"] without rest ^[Or "_at_ Nohah," a location] _and_ trod them ^[Hebrew "him"] down opposite Gibeah to the east.

###### v44
And eighteen thousand men from Benjamin fell, all of them _able men_. ^[Literally "men of strength"]

###### v45
And they turned and fled toward the wilderness, to the rock of Rimmon, but they cut down on the main roads five thousand men; and they pursued after them up to Gidom, and they struck down two thousand men.

###### v46
So all of Benjamin who fell on that day were twenty-five thousand _sword-wielding men_; ^[Literally "men drawing sword"] all of these _were_ _able men_. ^[Literally "men of strength"]

###### v47
But six hundred turned and fled toward the wilderness, to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon _for_ four months.

###### v48
And the men of Israel returned to the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin, and they put them to _the edge of the sword_, ^[Literally _the_ mouth of _the_ sword"] both the inhabitants of city and _the_ animals that were found; they also set on fire all the cities that they found.
