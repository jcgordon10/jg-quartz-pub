[[Judg-20|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
The men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, saying, "None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife."

###### v2
And the people of Bethel came and sat there until evening before God, and they lifted their voices and _wept bitterly_. ^[Literally "they cried a great weeping"]

###### v3
And they said, "Why, Yahweh, God of Israel, has it happened today in Israel that one tribe is lacking from Israel?"

###### v4
On the next day the people rose early, and they built there an altar and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.

###### v5
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] said, "Who in the assembly has not come up from all the tribes of Israel to Yahweh?" For a solemn oath was _taken_ concerning whoever did not come up to Yahweh at Mizpah, saying, "He will certainly be put to death."

###### v6
But the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] had compassion for Benjamin, their relatives, ^[Hebrew "his brother"] and they said, "Today one tribe is cut off from Israel.

###### v7
What will we do for them--for the _ones_ being left over--for wives? For we have sworn by Yahweh not to give to them our daughters as wives."

###### v8
They asked, "Which one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Yahweh at Mizpah?" And behold, no one came from Jabesh-gilead to the camp, to the assembly.

###### v9
The people were counted, and no one was there from the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead.

###### v10
And the congregation sent there twelve thousand men from the troops, and they commanded them, saying, "Go, strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with _the edge of the sword_, ^[Literally "_the_ mouth of _the_ sword"] and the women and children.

###### v11
This is the thing you will do: _you will destroy_ ^[Literally "you will devote to destruction"] every man and _every woman who had sex with a man_." ^[Literally "every woman who knows the bed of a man"]

###### v12
And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins ^[Hebrew "virgin"] who had not _had sex with a man_, ^[Literally "known a man, as far as _the_ bed of a male"] and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which _is_ in the land of Canaan.

###### v13
Then the congregation sent and spoke all _this_ to the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin who _were_ at the rock of Rimmon, and _they assured them they would not be hurt_. ^[Literally "they proclaimed peace to them"]

###### v14
And Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave to them the women whom they kept alive from Jabesh-gilead; but they were not enough for them.

###### v15
And the people felt sorry for Benjamin because _Yahweh weakened the tribes of Israel_. ^[Literally "Yahweh make a breach with the tribes of Israel"]

###### v16
So the elders of the congregation said, "What should we do for the remaining _ones_ for wives, since the women from Benjamin have been destroyed?"

###### v17
And they said, "_There must be_ a remnant for Benjamin, so that a tribe will not be blotted out from Israel.

###### v18
But we cannot give them wives from our daughters." (For the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] swore, saying, "Cursed be _anyone_ who gives a wife to Benjamin.")

###### v19
And they said, "Look, the annual feast of Yahweh _is_ in Shiloh, which _is_ to the north of Bethel, _east_ ^[Literally "rising of the sun"] of _the_ main road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.

###### v20
They instructed the descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin, saying, "Go, lie in ambush in the vineyards,

###### v21
and watch and look; when the daughters of Shiloh dance in the dances, come out from the vineyards and seize for yourselves a wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.

###### v22
And if their fathers or their brothers complain to us, we will say to them, 'Allow us to have them, because we did not capture a wife for each man in the battle, and because you did not give _them_ to them, _or else_ ^[Literally "as the time"] you would have been guilty.'"

###### v23
The descendants ^[Or "sons/children"] of Benjamin did likewise, and they took wives for each of them from the dancers whom they seized, and they went and returned to their territory, and they rebuilt the cities and they lived in them.

###### v24
So the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] dispersed from there at that time according to tribe and family; and they went out from there, each one to their own territory.

###### v25
In those days there was no king in Israel; each one did what was right in his own eyes.
