[[Ezek-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
And it was in _the_ thirtieth year, in the fourth _month_, on the fifth _day_ of the month, and I _was_ in the midst of ^[Or "among"] the exiles ^[Hebrew "exile"] by the _Kebar River_. ^[Literally "river of Kebar"] The heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.

###### v2
On the fifth _day_ of the month--it was the fifth year of the exile of the king Jehoiachin--

###### v3
the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] clearly ^[Or "certainly"] to Ezekiel the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of _the_ Chaldeans at the _Kebar River_, ^[Literally "river of Kebar"] and the hand of Yahweh was on him there.

###### v4
And I looked, ^[Or "saw"] and look! A storm wind _was_ coming from the north, a great cloud, and fire flashing back and forth, and brightness around _and_ _within it_, ^[Literally "for it"] and from its midst ^[Or "middle"] _it was_ like _the_ outward appearance of amber stone from the midst ^[Or "middle"] of the fire.

###### v5
And from its midst ^[Or "middle"] _was_ the likeness of four living creatures, and this _was_ their appearance: _a human form_, ^[Literally "this their appearance the likeness of a human to them"]

###### v6
and _each had four faces_, ^[Literally "and four faces to each"] and _each of them had four wings_. ^[Literally "and four wings to each for them"]

###### v7
And their legs _were_ straight legs, and the sole of their feet _was_ like the sole of _the_ foot of a calf, and _they_ were sparkling like the outward appearance of polished bronze.

###### v8
And under their wings _were_ _human hands_ ^[Literally "hand his a man"] on their four sides. And their faces and their wings for the four of them _were as follows_:

###### v9
_their wings were touching one another_; ^[Literally "their wings _were_ touching each her sister"] _each of them went straight forward_, ^[Literally "they did not turn at their going"] _without turning right or left_. ^[Literally "each toward the side of his face they went"]

###### v10
The likeness of their faces _was the_ face of a human _in front_, and _the_ face of a lion on the right _of each of them_, ^[Literally "of the four of them"] and the face of an ox on the left _of each of them_, ^[Literally "of the four of them"] and _the_ face of an eagle _for each of them_. ^[Literally "of the four of them"]

###### v11
So _were_ their faces; their wings _were_ spread out _upward_; ^[Literally "from to above"] each _had_ two touching one another and two covering their bodies.

###### v12
And each _went straight forward_; ^[Literally "toward the side of his face they went"] _wherever the spirit went_ ^[Literally "towards which it was there the spirit"] they went, _and_ _they did not turn as they went_. ^[Literally "they did not turn at their going"]

###### v13
As for ^[Or "And"] the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance _was_ like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. It ^[That is, the fire] _was_ moving to and fro between the living creatures, and _the fire was very bright_ ^[Literally "brightness _was_ for the fire"] and lightning _was_ going out from the fire.

###### v14
And the living creatures _were speeding to and fro_ ^[Literally "sped forth and returned"] like the appearance of lightning.

###### v15
And I saw the living creatures, and look! A wheel was on the earth ^[Or "ground"] beside _each of the living creatures that had four faces_. ^[Literally "the living creatures for the four of his/its faces." The LXX has "for the four of them."]

###### v16
The appearance of the wheels and their construction _was_ like _the_ appearance of beryl, ^[Or "chrysolite," or "topaz"; this stone is difficult to identify exactly] and _they all looked alike_, ^[Literally "likeness _was_ one for the four of them"] and their appearance and their construction _was_ _like a wheel within a wheel_. ^[Literally "as that it was a wheel in the midst of a wheel"]

###### v17
When they moved, they went toward their four sides; they did not _veer at all as they went_. ^[Literally "turn away when they went"]

###### v18
And their rims _were high and awesome_, ^[Literally "height _was_ for them and awesomeness _was_ for them"] and _all four of_ ^[Literally "of the four of them"] their rims _were_ full of eyes _all_ around.

###### v19
And at the going of the living creatures, the wheels next to them _also_ went, and _when the creatures were lifted from the ground_ ^[Literally "and at the lifting up of the creatures from the earth"] the wheels _also_ rose.

###### v20
_Wherever_ ^[Literally "Toward which"] the spirit went they would go there, and the wheels rose, for the spirit of the living creatures ^[Hebrew "creature"] _was_ in the wheels.

###### v21
At their ^[That is, the living creatures] going, they ^[That is, the wheels] go, and at their standing, they stood, and at their being lifted up from on the earth, ^[Or "ground"] the wheels rose, ^[Or "were lifted up"] for the spirit of the living creatures ^[Hebrew "creature"] _was_ in the wheels.

###### v22
Now ^[Or "And"] _the_ likeness above the heads of the living creatures _was_ an expanse like the outward appearance of _awesome_ ^[Literally "terrible"] _ice_ ^[Literally "frozen water"] spread out above their heads _upward_. ^[Literally "from to upward"]

###### v23
And under the expanse their wings _were stretched out_ straight _one toward the other_; ^[Literally "each towards its sister"] each had two _wings_ covering them, and each had two _wings_ covering their bodies.

###### v24
And I heard the sound of their wings like _the_ sound of many waters, like the voice of Shaddai, ^[Often translated "Almighty"] _and_ _when they moved_ ^[Literally "at their going"] _there was_ a sound of tumult like _the_ sound of an army; _when they stood still_ ^[Literally "at their standing"] they lowered their wings.

###### v25
And there was ^[Or "it was"] a sound from above the expanse that _was_ above their heads, _and when they stood_ ^[Literally "at their standing"] they lowered their wings.

###### v26
And from above the expanse that _was_ above their heads _there was_ the likeness of a throne, _looking like a sapphire_, ^[Literally "_the_ appearance of a stone of sapphire"] and above the likeness of the throne _was_ a likeness similar to ^[Or "like"] _the_ appearance of a human on it, _but_ _above it_. ^[Literally "from to above"]

###### v27
And I saw _something_ like _the_ outward appearance of amber, _something_ like _the_ appearance of fire, _with_ a covering around _it_, from the likeness of his loins and _upward_. ^[Literally "to above"] And from the likeness of his loins and _downward_ ^[Literally "to down"] I saw _something_ like _the_ appearance of fire, and _it was radiant all around_. ^[Literally "brightness _was_ for it around"]

###### v28
Like the appearance ^[Or "likeness"] of a bow that is in the cloud on _a rainy day_, ^[Literally "the day of the rain"] such _was_ the radiance ^[Or "brightness"] around it; _thus was_ the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh. And I saw, and I fell on my face, and I heard a voice speaking.
