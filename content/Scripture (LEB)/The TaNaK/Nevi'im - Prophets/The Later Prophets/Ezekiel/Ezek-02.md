And he said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] I am sending you to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] to nations ^[Or "a people"] _who are_ rebelling, who rebelled against me, they and their ancestors, ^[Hebrew "fathers"] they transgressed against me _until this very day_. ^[Literally "until the day the this"]

###### v4
And the children ^[Or "sons"] _are_ _impudent_ ^[Literally "hard of face"] and _stubborn_, ^[Literally "strong of heart"] _and so_ I am sending you to them, and you must say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh!'
