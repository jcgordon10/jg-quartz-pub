###### v1
And he said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] what you find, eat! Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel."

###### v2
And I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat,

###### v3
and he said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] you must give your stomach _this_ to eat, and you must fill your belly _with_ this scroll that I _am_ giving to you." And I ate, and it became _like sweet honey_ ^[Literally "like honey for sweetness"] in my mouth.

###### v4
And he said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] come! Go to the house of Israel, and you must speak to them with my words.

###### v5
For you are sent to the house of Israel, not to a people _of obscure speech_ ^[Literally "obscure of lip"] and _of a difficult language_, ^[Literally "heavy/thick of tongue"]

###### v6
_and_ not to many nations _of obscure speech_ ^[Literally "obscure of tongue"] and _a difficult language_ ^[Literally "heavy/thick of tongue"] _whose words_ ^[Literally "their words"] you do not understand, _for_ if I had sent you to them they would have listened to you.

###### v7
And the house of Israel, they are not willing to listen to you, for they _are_ not willing to listen to me, for all of the house of Israel is hard of forehead, and they _are_ hard of heart.

###### v8
_But_ look, I have made ^[Or "set"] your face hard _against_ ^[Literally "to correspond _to_"] their faces and your forehead hard _against_ ^[Literally "to correspond _to_"] their forehead.

###### v9
Like a diamond _harder than flint_ ^[Literally "hard more than flint"] I have made your forehead; you must not fear them, and you must not be dismayed _on account of them_, ^[Literally "from the face of them"] for they _are a rebellious house_. ^[Literally "_are_ a house of rebellion"]

###### v10
And he said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] all of my words that I shall speak to you, receive into ^[Hebrew "in"] your heart and hear with your ears.

###### v11
And come, go to the exiles, ^[Hebrew "exile"] to the children ^[Or "sons"] of your people, and you must speak to them, and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh!' whether they listen or whether they fail _to listen_."

###### v12
And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake when the glory of Yahweh rose from its place.

###### v13
And _it was_ the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching lightly ^[Or "brushing against"] _one against the other_, ^[Literally "each against each _its sister_] and the sound of the wheels beside them and _the_ sound of a great earthquake.

###### v14
And _the_ Spirit lifted me and took me, and I went _in_ bitterness in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Yahweh _was_ strong on me.

###### v15
And I went to the exiles ^[Hebrew "exile"] _at_ Tel Abib, who _were_ dwelling near the _Kebar River_, ^[Literally "river of Kebar"] and I sat _where_ they _were_ dwelling. I sat there seven days in the midst of them, stunned.

###### v16
And then it happened ^[Or "was"] at _the_ end of seven days, _the word of Yahweh came_ ^[Literally "and it was the word of Yahweh to me to say _saying_"] to me, saying,

###### v17
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] I have appointed you _as_ a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, then you must warn them from me.

###### v18
_When I say_ ^[Literally "at/in my saying"] to the wicked, 'Surely you will die,' and you do not warn him and you do not speak to warn _the_ wicked from his wicked way _so that he may live_, ^[Literally "so that _you_ let him live"] that wicked _person_ will die because of his guilt, and from your hand I will seek his blood.

###### v19
And you, if you do warn _the_ wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness and from his wicked way, on account of his guilt he will die, and you yourself will have saved your life. ^[Or "soul," or "self"]

###### v20
And _when the righteous turns from his righteousness_ ^[Literally "and at _the_ to turn of _the_ righteous from his righteousness"] and does injustice, and I place ^[Or "give"] a stumbling block _before him_, ^[Literally "to the face of him"] he will die, for you did not warn him. Because of his sin he will die, and his righteousness ^[Or "righteous deeds"] that he did will not be remembered, and his blood I shall seek from your hand.

###### v21
And if you warn him, the righteous, not to sin, and _the_ righteous does not sin, surely he will live, for he heeded a warning. And you will have saved your life." ^[Or "soul," or "self"]

###### v22
And the hand of Yahweh was on me there, and he said to me, "Rise up, go out to the valley, and there I will speak with you."

###### v23
And I rose up, and I went to the valley, and, look, there the glory of Yahweh _was_ standing, like the glory that I saw near the _Kebar River_, ^[Literally "river of Kebar"] and I fell on my face.

###### v24
And _the_ Spirit ^[Or "_a_ spirit"] came into me, and it made me stand on my feet, and he spoke with me and said to me, "Come, shut yourself _inside your house_, ^[Literally "in the midst of your house"]

###### v25
and you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] look, they will place ^[Or "give"] cords on you, and they will tie you up with them. Then you will not go out into the midst of them.

###### v26
And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, and you will be silenced, and you will not be a reproving man for them, for they _are a rebellious house_. ^[Literally "a house of rebellion"]

###### v27
And when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you must say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "The _one_ hearing him, let him hear, and the _one_ failing _to hear_, let him fail,"' for they _are a rebellious house_. ^[Literally "a house of rebellion"]
