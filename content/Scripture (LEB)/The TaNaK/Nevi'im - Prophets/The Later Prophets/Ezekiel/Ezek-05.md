###### v1
"And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] take for yourself ^[Hebrew "you"] a sword, sharp _as_ _a barber's razor_. ^[Literally "the razor of the barbers"] Take it for yourself, and you must cause _it_ to pass over your head and over your beard, and you must take for yourself a set of scales for weighing, and you must divide them. ^[That is, the hairs]

###### v2
A third you must burn with fire in the midst ^[Or "middle"] of the city at _the completion_ ^[Literally "the completing"] of the days of the siege, and you must take a third, and you must strike _it_ with the sword around it, and a third you must scatter to the wind, and I will draw a sword behind them.

###### v3
And you must take from these a few in number, and you must tuck them in your hem.

###### v4
And from them again you shall take _some_, and you must throw them in the middle of the fire, and you must burn them with fire; from it a fire will go out to all of the house of Israel.

###### v5
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: This _is_ Jerusalem in the midst of the nations _where_ I have put her, and countries _are_ around her.

###### v6
But she has rebelled against my regulations to the point of wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that _are_ around her; for they rejected my regulations, and _as for_ my statutes, they did not walk in them.

###### v7
Therefore, thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because of your commotion more than the nations that _are_ around you--you did not walk in my statutes, and you did not do my regulations, and according to the regulations of the nations that _are_ around you, you did not do.

###### v8
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Look! I, _even I_, ^[Literally "surely I"] am against you, and I will execute judgment in the midst of you before the eyes of the nations,

###### v9
and I will do with you _that_ which I have not done, and which I will not do again, because of all of your detestable things.

###### v10
Therefore ^[Literally "to thus"] parents ^[Or "fathers"] will eat children ^[Or "sons"] in the midst of you, and children ^[Or "sons"] will eat their parents, ^[Or "fathers"] and I will execute judgment in you, and I will scatter your entire remnant to every wind.

###### v11
Therefore _as surely as I live_, ^[Literally "alive I _am_"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, _Surely_ ^[Literally "If not"] because you have defiled my sanctuary with all of your vile idols and with all of your detestable things, _now indeed I_ ^[Literally "and also I"] will reduce, and my eye will not take pity, and surely I will show no compassion.

###### v12
A third of you will die because of the plague, and because of the famine they will perish in the midst of you, and a third will fall through the sword around you, and a third I will scatter to every direction of the wind, and I will draw _the_ sword behind them.

###### v13
And my anger will come to an end, and I will place my rage on them, and I will relent, and they will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my passion _when I fully vent my rage against them_. ^[Literally "at my finishing my anger against them"]

###### v14
And I will make you into a desolate place and into a disgrace among the nations that surround you before the eyes of _every one who passes by_. ^[Literally "every one of passing by"]

###### v15
And it will be ^[Or "and you will be"] _an_ object of taunting ^[Hebrew "taunt"] and _an_ object of mockery, a warning and a horror to the nations that _are_ around you whenever I execute judgments against you in anger and in wrath and in furious punishments! I, Yahweh, have spoken!

###### v16
When I send my arrows of deadly famine against them, which will be as destruction that I will send _in order_ to destroy you, I will increase famine against you, and I will break _the supply of food_ ^[Literally "staff of bread"] for you.

###### v17
And I will send against you famine and fierce animals, ^[Hebrew "animal"] and they will make you childless; and plague and blood will pass through you, and I will bring _the_ sword upon you. I, Yahweh, I have spoken!"
