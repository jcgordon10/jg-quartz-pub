###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, saying,

###### v2
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] set your face to the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them,

###### v3
and you must say, 'Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh, thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys: "Look, I _am_ bringing upon you _the_ sword, and I will destroy your high places,

###### v4
and your altars will be desolate, and your incense altars will be broken, and I will throw down your slain ones _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] your idols,

###### v5
and I will place ^[Or "give"] the corpses of the children of Israel _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.

###### v6
In all of your dwellings, the cities will be desolate and the high places will be ruined, so that your altars will be desolate and will suffer punishment. Your idols will be broken and will come to an end, and your incense altars will be cut down, and your works will be destroyed,

###### v7
and the slain one will fall in the midst of you, and _then_ you will know that I _am_ Yahweh.

###### v8
But ^[Or "And"] I will spare _some_, _so there will be_ ^[Literally "at their being"] for you fugitives from _the_ sword among the nations _when you are scattered_ ^[Literally "at you to be scattered"] in the countries.

###### v9
And your fugitives will remember me among the nations _to_ which they were taken captive, that I was shattered by _their adulterous heart_ ^[Literally "heart their which _was_ prostituting _itself_"] which departed from me, and by _their adulterous eyes_ ^[Literally "eyes their which _were_ prostituting"] which _went_ after their idols, and they will feel loathing _for themselves_, ^[Literally "for their face"] for the evil that they did, for all of their detestable things.

###### v10
And they will know that I _am_ Yahweh; not _in vain_ ^[Literally "to nothing"] I spoke to bring to them this evil."'

###### v11
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Clap your hand and stamp with your foot, and say, "Alas, for all of the detestable things of the evil of the house of Israel, _because of which_ ^[Literally "which"] they will fall with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague.

###### v12
The one who is far _away_ will die by the plague, and the one who is near will fall by the sword, and the one who is being left behind and being spared will die by the famine, and I will complete my rage on ^[Or "toward"] them.

###### v13
And you will know that I _am_ Yahweh _when their slain ones are in the midst of their idols_ ^[Literally "in the being of their slain ones in the midst of their idols"] around their altars at every high hill, on the tops of all the mountains and under every green tree and under every leafy oak--the place _at_ which they gave _a_ pleasing scent for all of their idols.

###### v14
And I will stretch out my hand against them, and I will make the land a desolation and a wasteland from the desert to Riblah in all of their dwellings, and they will know that I _am_ Yahweh."'"
