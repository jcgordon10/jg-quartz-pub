###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, saying,

###### v2
"And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel: '_The_ end comes, the end on the four corners of the land.

###### v3
Now the end _is_ on you, and I will send my anger on you, and I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring on you all your detestable things.

###### v4
And my eye will not take pity on you, and I will not show compassion for your ways; on you I will bring your detestable things; they will be in the midst of you, and you will know that I _am_ Yahweh.'

###### v5
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Look! Disaster after disaster _is_ coming!

###### v6
_The_ end comes, comes the end! It has awakened against you! Look! _It_ comes!

###### v7
Doom is coming against you, the dweller ^[Or "inhabitant"] of the land; the time comes, the day _is_ near, panic and not joy _is_ on the mountains.

###### v8
_Soon_ ^[Literally "now from near"] I will pour out my rage on you, and I will fully vent my anger on you, and I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring on you all of your detestable things.

###### v9
And my eye will not take pity, and I will not show compassion. According to your ways I will _deal with you_, ^[Literally "on you I will bring"] and your detestable things will be in the midst of you, and you will know that I _am_ Yahweh _who_ strikes. ^[Or "smites"]

###### v10
Look! The day is coming; doom goes out, the staff blossoms, pride sprouts.

###### v11
Violence has grown to _become_ a staff of wickedness; _none_ ^[Literally "not _any_"] from them _will remain_, and _none_ ^[Literally "not _any_"] from their abundance nor from their wealth; ^[Or "noise," or "multitude"; the same word appears in each of the next three verses] and prominence _will_ not _be_ among them.

###### v12
The time has come, the day has arrived; let not the buyer rejoice, and let the seller not mourn, for anger _is_ on all their multitude.

###### v13
For the seller will not return to the merchandise _while they are still alive_, ^[Literally "while still _is_ in the life, their life"] for the vision _is_ about all of its multitude; it will not change, and a man because of his guilt will not be able to hold onto his life.

###### v14
They shall blow on the trumpet and prepare _everything_, ^[Literally "the all"] but _there is_ no _one_ going to the battle, for my anger _is_ on all of their multitude.

###### v15
The sword _is outside_, ^[Literally "_is_ in the outside place"] and the plague and the famine _are inside_; ^[Literally "_are_ from _the_ house] _the one_ who _is_ in the field will die by the sword, and _the one_ who _is_ in the city, famine and plague will devour him.

###### v16
And _if_ their survivors will escape, they will be on the mountains, like the doves of the valley, all of them groaning, each because of his guilt.

###### v17
All of the hands will hang limp, and all of _the knees will be wet with urine_. ^[Literally "_the_ knees will flow _with_ water"]

###### v18
And they will wear sackcloth, and horror will cover them, and on all of _the_ faces _will be_ shame, and baldness on all of their heads.

###### v19
Their silver they will discard on the streets, and filth will be their gold; their silver and their gold will not be able to rescue them on the day of the wrath of Yahweh. They will not satisfy their _hunger_ ^[Literally "selves," or "desire"] and their stomachs they will not fill, for their guilt will be their ^[Hebrew "the"] stumbling block.

###### v20
"'And the beauty of its ^[Or "their"] ornament _he made into a prideful thing_ ^[Literally "to _a_ prideful _thing_ he made it"] and made with it their detestable things and their vile idols; therefore I will make it into an impure thing for them.

###### v21
And I will give it into the hand of strangers as plunder and to the wicked people of the earth as spoil, and they will defile it.

###### v22
And I will turn my face from them, and they will defile my treasured _place_, and violent ones will enter and defile it.

###### v23
Make a chain for the land; it is full of _bloody crimes_ ^[Literally "_the_ judgment of blood"] and the city is full of violence.

###### v24
And I will bring _the_ worst of _the_ nations, and they will take possession of their houses, and I will put to an end _the_ pride of _the_ mighty ones, and their sanctuaries will be defiled.

###### v25
Anguish comes, and they will seek peace, and _there will be_ none.

###### v26
Calamity upon calamity will come, and rumor will be upon rumor. And they will seek a vision from a prophet, but instruction will perish from _the_ priest and counsel from _the_ elders.

###### v27
The king will mourn, and _the_ prince will be dressed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. According to their way I will do to ^[Or "deal with"] them, and according to their judgments I will judge them, and they will know that I _am_ Yahweh.'"
