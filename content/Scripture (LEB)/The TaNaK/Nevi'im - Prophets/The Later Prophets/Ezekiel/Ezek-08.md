###### v1
_And then_ ^[Literally "and it happened"] in the sixth year, in the sixth _month_, on the fifth _day_ of the month, I _was_ sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah _were_ sitting _before me_. ^[Literally "to the face of me"] And the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell on me there,

###### v2
and I saw, ^[Or "looked"] and look! A figure like _the_ appearance of a man; ^[Hebrew "fire"; but reading the BHS note 2b, "a man."] from the appearance of his waist and below _was_ fire, and from his waist and _upward_ ^[Literally "to above"] _was_ like _the_ appearance of brightness, ^[Or "shining metal"] like the _outward appearance of_ ^[Literally "eye"] amber.

###### v3
And he sent out _the_ form of a hand, and he took me by a lock of hair of my head, and _the_ Spirit lifted me between earth and heaven, and it brought me to Jerusalem in visions of God to the doorway of _the_ inner gate _that faced north_, ^[Literally "the _one_ facing north"] _at_ which there _was_ the seat of the image of jealousy, which was making jealous.

###### v4
And look! There _was_ the glory of the God of Israel like the vision that I saw in the valley.

###### v5
And he said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] lift up now ^[Particle of entreaty, "please/ please now"] your eyes _toward the north_." ^[Literally "_to_ the way of the north"] And I lifted up my eyes _toward the north_, ^[Literally "_to_ the way of the north"] and, look, _there was_ to the north of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy at the entrance.

###### v6
And he said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] "_Do you see_ ^[Literally "_Are_ you seeing?"] what they _are_ doing--great detestable things that the house of Israel _is_ committing ^[Or "doing"] here _so as_ to drive _me_ from ^[Hebrew "from upon"] my sanctuary, and yet _you will see again_ ^[Literally "you will return you will see"] greater ^[Or "worse"] detestable things."

###### v7
And he brought me to the doorway of the courtyard, and I saw, and look! A hole in the wall.

###### v8
And he said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] dig now ^[Or "please"] through the wall." And I dug through the wall, and look! There was a doorway.

###### v9
And he said to me, "Come and see the detestable things, the evil that they are doing ^[Or "making"] here.

###### v10
And I came, and I saw, and look, all kinds of creatures ^[Hebrew "creature"] and detestable beasts; ^[Hebrew "beast"] _and_ all of the idols of the house of Israel _were_ carved on the wall _all around_. ^[Literally "around around"]

###### v11
And seventy men from the elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, _was_ standing in the midst of them, _and_ _they were_ standing _before them_. ^[Literally "to the face of them"] Each _one_ _had_ his censer in his hand, and the fragrance of the cloud of the incense _was_ going up.

###### v12
And he said to me, "Have you seen, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] what the elders of the house of Israel _are_ doing in the dark, each in the inner rooms of his idol, for _they are_ saying, 'Yahweh _is_ not seeing us; Yahweh has abandoned the land.'"

###### v13
And he said to me, "Still _you will see again_ ^[Literally "you will return, you will see"] greater detestable things that they _are_ doing."

###### v14
And he brought me to the doorway of the gate of the house of Yahweh that _is_ toward the north, and look! There _were_ the women sitting weeping for Tammuz.

###### v15
And he said to me, "Have you seen, son of man? ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] Still _you will see again_ ^[Literally "you will return, you will see"] greater detestable things than these."

###### v16
And he brought me to the inner courtyard of the house of Yahweh, and look, _at_ the doorway of the temple of Yahweh, between the portico and the altar, _there were_ about twenty-five men _with_ their backs to the temple of Yahweh and their faces toward the east, and they _were_ bowing down toward the east before the sun.

###### v17
And he said to me, "Have you seen, son of man? ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] _Was it too small a thing_ ^[Literally "was it _too_ little"] for the house of Judah _to do_ ^[Literally "from doing"] the detestable things that they did here? For they filled up the land _with_ violence, and _they provoked me to anger again_, ^[Literally "they returned to provoke me to anger"] and look! They _are_ putting the branch to their nose.

###### v18
And so I will act in rage, and my eye will not take pity, and I will not have compassion, and they will cry in my ear _with_ a loud voice, and I will not hear them."
