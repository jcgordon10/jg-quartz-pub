And he called in my ears _with_ a loud voice, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "_They_ have come near, ^[Or "Come near" (imperative)] the punishers of the city, and each _with_ his weapon of destruction in his hand.

###### v2
And look! Six men coming from the way of _the upper gate_ ^[Literally "the gate of the upper"] that faced _northward_, ^[Literally "faced north + directive"] and each _with_ his weapon for ^[Or "of"] shattering in his hand; and one man _was_ in the midst of them, dressed in linen, and the ^[Or "his"] writing case of the scribe _was_ at his side. And they came and stood beside the bronze altar.

###### v3
And the glory of the God of Israel lifted itself up from upon the cherub that he was on ^[Hebrew "which he was on it"] _and went_ to the threshold of the house, ^[That is, the temple] and he called to the man who _was_ clothed in linen _with a scribal writing case at his side_. ^[Literally "whom a writing case of a scribe _was_ at his side"]

###### v4
And Yahweh said to him, "Go through in the midst of the city, in the midst of Jerusalem, and you must place a mark on the foreheads of the men _who are groaning and lamenting_ ^[Literally "the men the groaning and the lamenting"] about all of the detestable things _that are being done_ ^[Literally "the being done"] in the midst of her."

And to the others he said in my hearing, "Go through the city behind him and kill! Your eyes shall not take pity, and you shall not have compassion.

You must kill _totally_ ^[Literally "to destruction"] old man, young man and young woman, and little children and women, but _concerning_ ^[Literally "upon"] every man _with the mark on him_ ^[Literally "which is on him the mark"] you must not approach; and from my sanctuary you must begin." And they began with the old men who _were before_ ^[Literally "_were_ to the face of"] the house. ^[That is, the temple]

###### v7
And he said to them, "Defile the house ^[Or "temple"] and fill the courtyards _with_ the dead; go out! And they went out, and they killed in the city.

"_Will_ you _be_ destroying all of the remnant of Israel _while you pour out your rage_ ^[Literally "when pouring out your rage"] on Jerusalem?"

###### v9
And he said to me, "The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah _is_ _exceedingly_ ^[Literally "with very very"] great, and the land is filled with bloodguilt, and the city is full of injustice. For they say Yahweh abandoned the land, and _Yahweh does not see_. ^[Literally "not Yahweh _is_ seeing]
