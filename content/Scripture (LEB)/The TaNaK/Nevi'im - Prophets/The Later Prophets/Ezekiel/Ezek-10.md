###### v1
And I looked, and look! On the expanse that _was_ above the head of the cherubim _something_ like a stone of sapphire, ^[Or "lapis lazuli"] _and_ like _the_ appearance of _the_ shape of a throne it appeared above them.

###### v2
And he spoke ^[Or "said"] to the man clothed in linen and said, "Go _in among the wheel area under the cherubim_ ^[Literally "to between to the wheel to under the cherub"] and fill the hollow of your hands _with_ coals of fire from among the cherubim, and toss _them_ on the city." And he went _right_ before my eyes.

###### v3
Now ^[Or "And"] the cherubim _were_ standing on _the_ south of the temple _when the man went_, ^[Literally "at his coming the man"] and the cloud filled the inner courtyard.

###### v4
And the glory of Yahweh rose up from on the cherub toward ^[Or "onto"] the threshold of the house, ^[Or "temple"] and the house ^[Or "temple"] was filled with the cloud, and the courtyard was filled with the brightness of the glory of Yahweh.

###### v5
And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard _as far as_ ^[Literally "up to"] the outer courtyard; _it was_ like the voice of God Shaddai ^[Often translated "Almighty"] _when he speaks_. ^[Literally "in his speaking"]

###### v6
And then at his command ^[Or "when he commanded"] to the man clothed in linen, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "Take fire from among the wheel area from among the cherubim," he went and stood beside the wheel.

###### v7
Then the cherub stretched out his hand from among ^[Or "between"] the cherubim toward the fire that _was_ among ^[Or "between"] the cherubim, and he lifted up and gave ^[Or "placed"] _it_ into the hollow of the hand of _the man_ clothed with linen, and he took _it_, and he went out.

###### v8
And _there_ appeared for ^[Literally "to"] the cherubim _the_ form of _a human hand_ ^[Literally "a hand of a man"] under their wings.

###### v9
And I saw, and look, four wheels beside the cherubim, _one wheel beside each cherub_, ^[Literally "wheel one beside the cherub one, and wheel one beside the cherub one"] and the appearance of the wheels _was_ like _the_ outward appearance of _turquoise stone_. ^[Literally "stone of turquoise"]

###### v10
Their appearance ^[That is, of the wheels] _was the same for each of the four of them_, ^[Literally "likeness one _was_ for the four of them"] as if the wheel was in the midst of a wheel.

###### v11
_When they went_ ^[Literally "In their going"] to the four of their directions _that_ they went, they did not change direction _when they went_, ^[Literally "At their going"] for the place _to_ which the head ^[Or "first" or "lead wheel"] turned, they went behind him; they did not change direction at their going.

###### v12
And _their whole body_, ^[Literally "the whole of their body"] and their rims, and their spokes, and their wings, and the wheels _were_ full of eyes _all_ around--_the wheels for the four of them_. ^[Literally "for the four of them their wheels"]

###### v13
Concerning the wheels, he _was_ calling them "the wheelwork" _in my hearing_. ^[Literally "in my ears"]

###### v14
And _each one had four faces_; ^[Literally "four faces _were_ to each"] the face of the one _was_ the face of a cherub, and the face of the second _was the_ face of a human, and the face of the third _was the_ face of a lion, and the fourth _was the_ face of an eagle.

###### v15
And the cherubim rose; that is, the living creatures ^[Hebrew "creature"] that I saw at the _Kebar River_. ^[Literally "river of Kebar"]

###### v16
And _when the cherubim went_, ^[Literally "at the going of the cherubim"] the wheels beside them went; and _when the cherubim lifted their wings to rise up from the earth_, ^[Literally "and at the lifting of the cherubim wings their to rise from on the earth"] the wheels also did not turn aside from beside them.

###### v17
_When they stood_, ^[Literally "at their standing"] they stood, and at their rising, they rose with them, for the spirit of the living creatures _was_ in them.

###### v18
And the glory of Yahweh went out from ^[Hebrew "from on"] the threshold of the temple, and it stood above the cherubim.

###### v19
And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and they rose from the earth before my eyes. At their going out, the wheels _were_ ^[Hebrew "to"] beside them. And he stood _at_ the doorway of the eastern gate of the temple ^[Or "house"] of Yahweh, and the glory of the God of Israel _was over them_. ^[Literally "on them from to above"]

###### v20
This _was_ ^[Or "these were"] the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel at the _Kebar River_, ^[Literally "river of Kebar"] and I knew that they _were_ cherubim.

###### v21
_Each one had four faces_, ^[Literally "four faces _were_ for one/each"] and _there were_ four wings for each, and _the_ likeness of _human hands_ ^[Literally "hands of a man"] _was_ under their wings.

###### v22
And the likeness of their faces, they _were_ the faces that I saw at the _Kebar River_; ^[Litearlly "river of Kebar"] _thus was_ their appearance, and they each went _straight ahead_. ^[Literally "to the opposite of face his"]
