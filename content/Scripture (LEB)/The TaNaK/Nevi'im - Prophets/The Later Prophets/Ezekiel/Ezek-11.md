###### v1
And _the_ Spirit lifted me up, and it brought me to the eastern gate, the one facing east, of the temple ^[Or "house"] of Yahweh. And look, there were twenty-five men in the doorway of the gate, and I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur in the midst of them, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the commanders of the people.

###### v2
And he said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] these _are_ the men _who devise mischief_, ^[Literally "the ones devising mischief"] and _who are_ offering bad counsel in this city,

###### v3
who _are_ saying, "The building of houses _is_ not near; _the city_ is the pot, and we _are_ the flesh.

###### v4
Therefore prophesy against them! Prophesy, son of man!" ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"]

###### v5
And the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and he said to me, "Say, 'thus says Yahweh: "This is what you think, house of Israel, and I myself know them, ^[Hebrew "it"] the thoughts of your spirit.

###### v6
You made your slain ones numerous in this city, and you have filled its streets _with_ slain ones."' ^[Hebrew "slain one"]

###### v7
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Your slain ones whom you put in its midst, they _are_ the flesh, and it is _the_ pot, and I ^[Hebrew "he"] will bring you out from its midst.

###### v8
_The_ sword you have feared, and _the_ sword I will bring against you!" _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v9
"And I will bring you out from its midst, and I will give you into _the_ hand of strangers, and I will execute judgments against you.

###### v10
By the sword you will fall at the border of Israel; I will judge you, and you will know that I _am_ Yahweh.

###### v11
It will not be as a pot to you, and _so_ you would be ^[Or "will be"] in the midst of it as flesh, _for_ at the border of Israel I will judge you.

###### v12
And you will know that I _am_ Yahweh, whose ^[Hebrew "which"] rules you did not follow, and whose ^[Hebrew "my"] regulations you did not do, but according to the regulations of the nations that _are_ around you, you acted."' ^[Or "did"]

###### v13
And it happened _that_ _as I was prophesying_, ^[Literally "at my prophesying"] Pelatiahu the son of Benaiahu died! And I fell on my face, and I cried _with_ a loud voice, and I said, "Ah, Lord Yahweh, you _are_ making _a_ complete destruction _of_ the remnant of Israel!"

###### v14
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Or "to say"]

###### v15
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] your brothers, your brothers, the men of your redemption, and all of the house of Israel, all of it, _who said concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem_, ^[Literally "which they said concerning them the inhabitants of Jerusalem"] 'They are far from Yahweh, _therefore_ to us this land was given as a possession.'

###### v16
Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Though I have removed them _far away_ among the nations and though I have scattered them among the countries, yet I was a sanctuary to them _for a_ little while in the countries _to which they have gone_.'" ^[Literally "which they came there"]

###### v17
Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "And I will assemble you from the peoples, and I will gather you from the countries _to_ which you were scattered among them, and I will give the land of Israel to you.

###### v18
And _when_ they come there, then they will remove all of its vile idols and all of its detestable things from it.

###### v19
And I will give to them one heart, and a new spirit I will give ^[Or "put"] in their inner parts. And I will remove their ^[Hebrew "the"] heart of stone from their body, and I will give to them a heart of flesh,

###### v20
so that they may walk in my statutes, and they will keep my regulations, and they will do them, and they will be to me a people, and I myself will be to them as God.

###### v21
But to ^[Or "and to"] the heart of their abominations and the detestable things their heart is going. I will bring their way on their head," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.'"

###### v22
Then ^[Or "And"] the cherubim lifted up their wings, and their ^[Or "the"] wheels _were_ beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel _was over them_. ^[Literally "from to above"]

###### v23
And the glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city, and it stood _still_ on the mountain that _is_ to the east of the city.

###### v24
And _the_ Spirit lifted me up, and it brought me to Chaldea, to the exiles, ^[Hebrew "exile"] in the vision by the spirit of God; and the vision that I had seen _left me_. ^[Literally "went up from _being_ upon me"]

And I spoke to the exiles ^[Hebrew "exile"] all of the words of Yahweh that he had shown me.
