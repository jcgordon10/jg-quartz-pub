###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] you _are_ dwelling in the midst of the house of rebellion _who has eyes to see and they do not see_; ^[Literally "which eyes _are_ for them to see and not they see"] _they have ears to hear_, ^[Literally "ears _are_ for them to hear"] and they do not hear, for they _are_ a house of rebellion.

###### v3
And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] prepare for yourself ^[Hebrew "you"] _the_ baggage of an exile, and go into exile by day before their eyes. And you must go into ^[Hebrew "in"] exile from your place to another place before their eyes; perhaps they will see that they _are_ a house of rebellion.

###### v4
And you must bring out your baggage like _the_ baggage of an exile by day before their eyes, and you must go out in the evening before their eyes like _those who go into exile_. ^[Literally "like _the_ goers out of an exile"]

###### v5
Before their eyes dig through for yourself, ^[Hebrew "you"] through the wall, and you must bring _the baggage_ out through it.

###### v6
Before their eyes, on your ^[Literally "the"] shoulder, you must lift up _the baggage_ in the dusk, _and_ your face you must cover, so that you may not see the land, for I make you _as_ a sign to the house of Israel."

###### v7
And I did _just as_ ^[Literally "so as that"] I was commanded; my baggage, like _the_ baggage of an exile, I brought out by day, and in the evening I dug through for myself ^[Hebrew "me"] into ^[Hebrew "in"] the wall with my hand in the dusk; I brought _the baggage_ on _my_ shoulder; I carried _it_ before their eyes.

###### v8
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me in the morning, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v9
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] did not they, the house of Israel, the house of rebellion, say to you, 'What _are_ you doing?'

###### v10
Say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "This oracle _is about_ the prince in Jerusalem and _the entire_ ^[Literally "all of"] house of Israel _who are among them_."' ^[Literally "which they _are_ in the midst of them"]

###### v11
Say, 'I am your sign, _and_ _just as_ ^[Literally "as that"] I did, so will it be done to them in the exile; into ^[Hebrew "in"] captivity they will go.'

###### v12
And the prince who _is_ in the midst of them, on _his_ shoulder he will carry _the baggage_ in the dusk, and ^[Or "in the dusk he will go out"] he will go out; _the wall will be dug through_ ^[Literally "through the wall they will dig"] to bring him through it; and he will cover his face so that he will ^[Or "may"] not see the land with his ^[Hebrew "the"] eye.

###### v13
And I will spread out my net on him, and he will be captured in my hunting snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and there he will die.

###### v14
And all who _are_ around him, his help ^[Or "support"] and all of his troops I will scatter _in every direction_, ^[Literally "to every direction of the wind"] and I will draw ^[Or "unsheathe"] _the_ sword behind them.

###### v15
And they will know that I _am_ Yahweh _when I scatter them_ ^[Literally "at my scattering them"] among the nations and I scatter them in the countries.

###### v16
But ^[Or "And"] I will spare from them _a few men_ ^[Literally "men of number"] from _the_ sword, from _the_ famine and from _the_ plague, so that they may tell of all their abominations among the nations _to_ which they will go, and they will know that I _am_ Yahweh."

###### v17
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v18
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] you must eat your food with trembling, and your water with shuddering, and with anxiety you must drink.

###### v19
And you must say to the people of the land, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the inhabitants of Jerusalem about the land of Israel: "They will eat their food with anxiety and their water they will drink with horror, because their land will be desolate from ^[Or "of"] its fullness because of all the violence of _those who are dwelling in it_. ^[Literally "the ones dwelling in it"]

###### v20
And _the inhabited cites will be desolate_, ^[Literally "the being inhabited _cities_ they will be desolate"] and the land will be a desolation, and you will know that I _am_ Yahweh."'"

###### v21
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v22
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] what _is_ this proverb _you people have_ ^[Literally "to you"] about the land of Israel, _saying_, ^[Literally "to you"] '_The days are prolonged_, ^[Literally "they are long the days"] and every vision has come to nothing.'

###### v23
Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "I will put an end _to_ this proverb, and they will not quote it as a proverb again in Israel."' But ^[Hebrew "But if"] say to them, 'The days are near, and _also_ the word of every vision.'

###### v24
For _there_ will not be any longer _any false vision_ ^[Literally "every vision of falseness"] or flattering divination in the midst of the house of Israel.

###### v25
For I, Yahweh, I will speak what I will speak _as a_ word, and it will be done. It will not prolong _itself_ any longer, for in your days, house of rebellion, I will speak a word and I will fulfill it!" _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v26
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v27
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] look! The house of Israel _is_ saying, 'The vision that he _is_ seeing _is_ for many days _from now_, and for distant times he _is_ prophesying.'

###### v28
Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "None of my words will _be_ prolonged any longer that I speak _as_ a word, and it will be fulfilled!"'" _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.
