###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Or "to say"]

###### v2
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] prophesy to ^[Or "against"] the prophets of Israel _who are prophesying_, ^[Literally "the _ones_ prophesying"] and you must say to _those who are_ prophets out of their own _imagination_, ^[Literally "heart"] 'Hear the word of Yahweh!'

###### v3
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Alas, for the foolish prophets who _are_ going after their _own_ spirit, _and they did not see anything_! ^[Literally "and not they saw"]

###### v4
Your prophets have been like foxes ^[Or "jackals"] among ruins.

###### v5
You did not go up into ^[Hebrew "in"] the breaches and repair a wall for the house of Israel to stand _firm_ in the battle on the day of Yahweh.

###### v6
They saw falseness and _a lying divination_, ^[Literally "a divination of a lie"] the ones saying, 'Declaration of Yahweh!' and Yahweh did not send them, and they wait _for the confirmation of their word_. ^[Literally "to confirm a word"]

###### v7
Have you not seen _a false vision_ ^[Literally "vision of falseness"] and spoken _a_ _lying divination_, ^[Literally "divination of a lie"] and _you_ said, 'Declaration of Yahweh!' but _I myself did not speak_. ^[Literally "I not I spoke"]

###### v8
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Because of your speaking falseness and _because_ you envisioned a lie, therefore, look! I _am_ against you!" _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v9
"And it will be my hand against the prophets who _are_ seeing falseness and who _are_ practicing lying divination. They will not be in the council of my people, and they will not be written _down_ in the record _book_ of the house of Israel, and into ^[Hebrew "in"] the land of Israel they will not come, and _then_ you will know that I _am_ the Lord Yahweh.

###### v10
Because, yes, because they led my people astray, _saying_ ^[Literally "to say"] 'Peace!' And _there is_ not peace. And _when_ anyone ^[Hebrew "he"] builds a flimsy wall, look, they coat it _with_ whitewash.

###### v11
Say to _those_ covering _it_ _with_ whitewash that it will fall; there will be _a torrent of rain_, ^[Literally "rain flooding"] and I will give stones of hail; they will fall!  ^[Or "and I will give great hailstones. They will fall"] And a _windstorm_ ^[Literally "wind of a storm"; or "with respect/concerning you stones of hail, they will fall"] will burst forth!

###### v12
And look! _When_ the wall falls, will it not be said to you, 'Where _is_ the whitewash _with_ which you covered _it_?'

###### v13
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'And _so_ I will let burst forth a _windstorm_ ^[Literally "a wind of storm"] in my rage, and _there will be a torrent of rain_ ^[Literally "rain flooding there will be"] in my anger, and hailstones in _my_ rage _for complete destruction_. ^[Literally "to complete destruction"]

###### v14
And I will break down the wall that you covered _with_ whitewash, and I will knock it to the ground, and its foundation will be revealed, and it will fall, and you will come to an end in the midst of it, and you will know that I _am_ Yahweh!

###### v15
And I will fully vent my rage against the wall and against those covering it _with_ whitewash, and I will say to you, "_The wall is no more_, ^[Literally "not _is_ the wall"] and _the people covering it are no more_, ^[Literally "not _are_ the _people_ whitewashing him"]

###### v16
_that is_, the prophets of Israel, the ones prophesying concerning Jerusalem and the ones seeing visions of peace, and there is not peace!'" " _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v17
"And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] place your face toward the daughters of your people who prophesy from their _imagination_, ^[Literally "heart"] and prophesy against them!

###### v18
And you must say, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Woe to _those who sew_ ^[Literally "_the_ sewers of"] magic charm bands on all the wrists ^[Or "joints"] of the hands of my _people_ and _those who make the veils_ ^[Literally "the makers of the veils"] _that are_ on the head of _people of_ every height, to ensnare _people's_ lives! ^[Or "souls"] Will you ensnare _the_ lives ^[Or "souls"] of my people _and keep yourselves alive_? ^[Literally "and lives/souls for you, you keep alive"]

###### v19
And you defiled me among my people for a handful of barley and for morsels of bread to kill persons who should not die and to keep alive persons who should not live by _means of_ your lies to my people _who are_ listening to _your_ lies."' ^[Hebrew "lie"]

###### v20
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Look! I am against your magic charm bands _with which you are ensnaring persons_ ^[Literally "which you _are_ ensnaring with them the souls/individuals"] as birds; I will tear them from your arms, and I will release the persons that you _are_ ensnaring, _treating_ persons as birds.

###### v21
And I will tear off your veils, and I will deliver my people from your hand, and they will not any longer be in your hand as prey, and you will know that I _am_ Yahweh.

###### v22
Because _you_ disheartened _the_ heart of _the_ righteous _by_ deception, and I have not ^[Or "did not"] caused him pain, and strengthened _the_ hands of _the_ wicked _so that he did_ not turn ^[Or "not to turn"] from his wicked way to save his life.

###### v23
Therefore falseness ^[Or "vanity" or "vain/false visions"] you will not see, ^[Or "observe"] and divination you will not practice ^[Or "you will indeed not practice divination"] any longer, and I will rescue my people from your hand, and you will know that I _am_ Yahweh!'"
