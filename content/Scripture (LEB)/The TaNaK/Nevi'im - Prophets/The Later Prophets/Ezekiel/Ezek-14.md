And I will set my face against that person, and I will make him to ^[Or "as"] _be_ a sign and _make him_ into ^[Hebrew "to"] _the subject of_ proverbs; and I will cut him off from the midst of my people, and you will know I _am_ Yahweh.

"If a fierce animal I _should_ let cross through the land, and it _should_ make it childless and it will be _a_ desolation, so that _there will_ not _be_ one crossing over _the land_ _due to_ ^[Literally "from the face of"] the presence of the animal,

###### v16
_even if_ these three men _were_ in the midst of it, _as surely as I live_," ^[Literally "live I"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, "surely they will not save sons and daughters; _they themselves alone_, ^[Literally "they to alone them"] they will be saved, but the land will be _a_ desolation.

They are coming out to you, and you will see their way, and with their deeds you will be consoled with respect to ^[Hebrew "for"] the evil that I brought over Jerusalem, all of _it_ that I brought over ^[Or "upon"] it.

###### v23
And they will console you when you see their way and their deeds, and you will know that not for nothing I did all that I did in it," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.
