[[Ezek-14|Previous Chapter]] | [[Ezek-16|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Son of man, how will the wood of the vine be _better than_ ^[Literally "more than"] _any of the wood of_ ^[Literally "all of the wood of"] the branch which is among the trees of the forest? ^[Or "wood"]

###### v3
Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can they take a tent peg from it to hang on it any object? ^[Or "vessel"]

###### v4
Look! It is given to the fire as fuel. The fire will consume two of its ends, and its middle will be charred. Is it useful for anything?

###### v5
Look! _When it is in perfect condition_, ^[Literally "In being it perfect"] it will not be used for anything, _how much less_ ^[Literally "indeed"] _when the fire has consumed it_ ^[Literally "for _if_ fire has consumed it"] and it is charred; and _then_ can it be used again for anything?

###### v6
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: _Just like_ ^[Literally "As that"] the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest ^[Or "wood"] which I gave to the fire for fuel, so I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

###### v7
And I will set my face against them. From the fire they _may__escape_, ^[Literally "go out"] but the fire will _yet_ consume them, and they will know that I _am_ Yahweh _when I set my face against them_. ^[Literally "in to set me my face against them"]

###### v8
And I will make the land _a_ desolation because _they acted very unfaithfully_!" ^[Literally "they displayed infidelity"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.
