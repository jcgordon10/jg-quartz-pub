###### v45
You _are_ a daughter of your mother _who_ abhorred her husband and her children, and you _are_ a sister of your sisters who abhorred their husbands and their children. Your mother _was_ a Hittite, and your father _was_ an Amorite.

###### v46
And your elder sister, she _is_ Samaria, and her daughters, _who are_ dwelling on your north, and your younger sister _is_ the one dwelling on your south; _she_ _is_ Sodom and her daughters.

###### v47
And you have not _only_ gone in their ways, but ^[Or "and"] you _also_ did according to their detestable things. _In such a short time_ ^[Literally "as few little and"] you behaved _more_ corruptly than they in all of your ways.

###### v48
_As surely as I live_,' ^[Literally "live I"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, 'surely your sister Sodom and her daughters did not _do_ as ^[Hebrew "as that"] you and your daughters did.

###### v49
Look!

BHS]

###### v52
Also, ^[Or "indeed"] you bear your disgrace, _by_ which you furnished justification to your sisters ^[Hebrew "sister"] through your sins _by_ which you acted more abominably than they; they were more righteous than you, and also, ^[Or "indeed"] you be ashamed and bear your disgrace through your making your sister righteous.

###### v53
And I will restore their fortune, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and _even_ the fortunes of your captivity in the midst of them,

in order that you may bear your disgrace and you may be put to shame because of all that you did at your consoling them.

###### v55
