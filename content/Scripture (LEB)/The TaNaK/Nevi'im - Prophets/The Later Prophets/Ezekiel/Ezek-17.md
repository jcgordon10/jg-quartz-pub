And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] tell a riddle and quote a proverb to the house of Israel,

###### v3
and you must say, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "_The great eagle with great wings and long feathers_ ^[Literally "the eagle the great great of _the_ wings long of _the_ feather"] _and_ _full of variegated plumage_ ^[Literally "full of _the_ plumage which _is_ for him _the_ variegated"] came to Lebanon and he took the treetop of the cedar.

###### v4
He plucked the top of its new plant shoot, and he brought it to the land of Canaan _and_ put it in a city of merchants,

###### v5
and he took from the seed of the land and placed it in _fertile soil_ ^[Literally "a field of seed"] on ^[Or "by"] many waters; _like_ a willow he planted it.

###### v6
And it sprouted, and _it became a vine spreading out_, ^[Literally "he was to vine spreading out"] low of height, turning its branches to him, and its roots were under it, and _it became a vine_, ^[Literally "and it was to a vine"] and it made ^[Or "sprouted"] branches, and it sent out foliage.

###### v7
"'"And there was another great eagle, great of wings and _with_ abundant plumage, and look! This vine stretched out its roots toward him and extended its branches to him to water it from the garden bed _where it was planted_. ^[Literally "from the garden bed of its planting"]

###### v8
It was planted in ^[Or "to"] _a_ good field by ^[Or "to"] many waters ^[Hebrew "water"] to produce branches ^[Hebrew "branch"] and to bear fruit to become ^[Hebrew "be"] _a beautiful vine_."' ^[Literally "to a vine of splendor"]

###### v9
Say, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Will it prosper? Will he not tear out its roots, and will he not make its fruit scaly, and it will wither, and all of the freshness of its vegetation will dry up? And to lift it from its roots _will not require great strength or many people_. ^[Literally "not with strong arm and with many people"]

###### v10
And look! _Though_ it is planted, will it prosper? _When the east wind strikes it_, ^[Literally "at striking her/it the wind of the east"] will it not dry up completely? On the garden bed of its vegetation it will dry up!"'"

###### v11
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_,

###### v12
"Say now to the rebellious house of Israel, 'Do you not know what these _are_?' ^[Or "mean"] Say, 'Look! The king of Babylon will come _to_ Jerusalem, and he will take its king and its officials, and he will bring ^[Or "take"] them to himself, ^[Hebrew "him"] _to_ Babylon.

###### v13
And he took from the seed of the kingship, and he made with him a covenant, and _he brought him under oath_, ^[Literally "and he brought him in_to_ oath"] and he took the rulers of the land,

###### v14
so that _they would_ be a humble kingdom and not lift itself up to keep his covenant _in order for it to stand_. ^[Literally "to standing her"; or "to let her stand"]

###### v15
But he rebelled against him by sending his messengers _to_ Egypt to give to him horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he escape doing these _things_, and can he break _the_ covenant and escape?

###### v16
_As I live_,' ^[Literally "live I"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, '_surely_ ^[Literally "if not"] in the place of the king _who made_ ^[Literally "who _he was_ making"] him king, who despised his oath and who broke his covenant with him--in the midst of Babylon he will die.

###### v17
And not with a great army and with a great crowd will Pharaoh work ^[Or "help/aid"] with him in the war, at the pouring out of a siege ramp and the building of siege works to destroy many lives.

###### v18
And he despised _the_ oath to break covenant. And, look, he gave his hand _in pledge_, and _yet_ he did all of these _things_. He will not escape.'

###### v19
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: '_As I live_, ^[Literally "live I"] _surely_ ^[Literally "if not"] my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke I will return upon his head.

###### v20
And I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my hunting net, and I will bring him _to_ Babylon, and I will enter into judgment with him there _about_ his infidelity that he displayed against me.

###### v21
And all of his choice troops, among all of his troops, they will fall by the sword, and _those who_ _are_ remaining, ^[Or "left over"] they will be scattered to all _the directions of the_ wind, and you will know that I, Yahweh, I have spoken.'

###### v22
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'And I will take, _even_ I, from the treetop of the high cedar, and I will plant _it_, from the head of its new plant shoot I will pluck a tender one, and I will plant _it_, _even_ I, on a high and lofty mountain.

###### v23
On the height of the mountain of Israel I will plant _it_, and it will carry ^[Or "bear"] branches, ^[Hebrew "branch"] and it will bear fruit, and _it will become a noble cedar_, ^[Literally "he will be to a cedar noble"] and all of the birds of all wings ^[Or "kinds"] will dwell under it in the shade of its branches.

###### v24
And all of the trees of the field will know that I, Yahweh, I will bring low a high tree, _and_ I will exalt a low, fresh tree, and I will make a dry tree flourish. I, Yahweh, I have spoken, and I will do _it_.'"
