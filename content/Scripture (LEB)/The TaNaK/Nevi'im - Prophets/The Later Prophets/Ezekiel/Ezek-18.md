###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"_What do you mean by_ ^[Literally "What _is_ to you"] quoting this proverb about the land of Israel, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'The fathers, they ate unripe fruit, and the teeth of the child became blunt.' ^[Or "dull," set on edge"]

###### v3
_As I live_, ^[Literally "life I"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, it will surely not any longer be _appropriate for you_ ^[Literally "to you"] to quote this proverb in Israel!

###### v4
Look! _All lives are mine_. ^[Literally "all of the lives _are_ for me they"] _The lives of father and son alike are mine_. ^[Literally "Like the life of the father and like the life of the son _is_ to me look"] The person ^[Or "life," or "soul"] sinning will die.

###### v5
And if a man is righteous and does justice and righteousness,

###### v6
and on the mountains he _does_ not eat and he _does_ not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and the wife of his neighbor he _does_ not defile and he _does_ not approach a woman of ^[Or "in"] menstruation,

###### v7
and he oppresses _no one_ ^[Literally "a person not"] _and_ he returns _a_ pledge for his loan _and he commits no robbery_ ^[Literally "robbed things not he seized"] _and_ he gives ^[Or "shares"] his bread to _the_ hungry and he covers a naked person _with_ a garment,

###### v8
_and_ _he does not charge interest_ ^[Literally "with the interest not he gives"] and he takes no usury, _and_ he holds back ^[Or "brings back"] his hand from injustice _and_ he executes _a_ judgment of fairness between _persons_, ^[Literally "man and man"]

###### v9
_and_ in my statutes he goes about and my regulations he keeps, ^[Or "watches"] _performing faithfully_ ^[Literally "to do with _with_ faithfulness"] --_then_ he is righteous, _and_ certainly he will live," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v10
"And _now_ he has a son, a violent one, _who sheds blood_ ^[Literally "shedding of blood"] _and does any of these things_ ^[Literally "and he does like from one from these"]

###### v11
(though ^[Hebrew "And"] he ^[That is, the father] did not do all of these _things_), for _the son_ also ^[Or "even"] eats on the mountains and he defiles the wife of his neighbor.

###### v12
He oppresses _the_ needy and _the_ poor, _and_ _he commits robbery_, ^[Literally "robbed things he seized"] _and_ he _does_ not return _a_ pledge for a loan, _and_ he lifts his eyes to the idols _so_ he does a detestable thing.

###### v13
_He charges interest_ ^[Literally "with the interest he gives"] and takes usury. Then, shall he live? He shall not live, _for_ he did all of these detestable things. Surely he will die! His blood will be on him.

###### v14
"And look! He has a son, and he sees all of the sin of his father that he did, and he sees _it_, but he does not _do_ it.

###### v15
On the mountains he does not eat, and he does not lift _up_ his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, _and_ the wife of his neighbor he does not defile.

###### v16
And he oppresses no one; he requires no pledge for a loan, and _he does not commit robbery_; ^[Literally "robbed things not does he seize"] he gives his bread to _the_ hungry, and he covers the naked person _with_ a garment.

###### v17
He brings back ^[Or "holds back"] his hand from iniquity; ^[Cf. verse [[Ezek-18#v8|8]]] he does not take interest and usury; he does my regulations; he goes ^[Or "walks"] in my statutes. He will not die because of the guilt of his father; he will surely live!

###### v18
Because his father _oppressed severely_; ^[Literally "he oppressed oppression"] _he stole from his brother_; ^[Literally "he seized robbed things of a brother"] _that_ which _is_ not good he did in the midst of his people, and look! He will die through ^[Or "in"] his guilt.

###### v19
"Yet ^[Or "And"] you say, 'Why _does_ the son not bear the guilt of the father?' And _since_ the son does justice and righteousness and he keeps all of my statutes and does them, he shall surely live!

###### v20
The person, ^[Or "soul," or "life"] the _one_ sinning, will die. A son shall not bear the guilt of the father, and a father shall not bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be on him; the wickedness of the wicked ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] shall be on him.

###### v21
But if the wicked returns from all of his sins ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] that he has done and he keeps all of my statutes and he does justice and righteousness, he shall surely live; he shall not die!

###### v22
All of his transgressions that he committed will not be remembered against ^[Or "for"] him. Through ^[Or "By means of"] his righteousness that he has done he shall live.

###### v23
Have I delight by any means ^[Or "in any way"] _in the_ death of _the_ wicked, _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, _and_ not at his turning from his way, _so that_ ^[Literally "and"] he lives?

###### v24
And _when the righteous turns_ ^[Literally "at turning of _the_ righteous"] from his righteousness, so that ^[Literally "and"] he does injustice, and does all of the detestable things that the wicked do, then ^[Or "and"] will he live _because of_ all of his righteousness ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] that he did? _Those things_ will not be remembered because of his infidelity that he displayed, and because of his _sin that he committed_. ^[Literally "sin that he sinned"] Through ^[Or "in/by"] them he shall die.

###### v25
"Yet ^[Or "And"] you say, 'The way of the Lord is not fair!' Listen, now, house of Israel, is my way not fair? _Is it_ not your ways _that_ are not fair?

###### v26
When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and he does injustice, then ^[Or "and"] he will die because of them; because of his injustice that he did he will die!

###### v27
And when the wicked turns from his wickedness that he did and he does justice and righteousness, _he will preserve his life_. ^[Literally "his soul/life he will keep alive"]

###### v28
And if he sees and he returns from all of his transgressions that he did, surely he will live; he will not die!

###### v29
And _yet_ they, the house of Israel, say, 'The way of the Lord is not fair!' _Are_ not my ways fair, house of Israel? _Are not your ways unfair?_ ^[Literally "not ways your not are right"]

###### v30
"Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, each one ^[Hebrew "man"] according to his ways," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh. "Repent ^[Or "Turn/Return"] and turn around from all of your transgression, and it will not be as a stumbling block of iniquity to you.

###### v31
Throw _away from yourselves_ ^[Literally "from on you"] all of your transgressions that you committed, ^[Hebrew "committed with them"] and make _for yourselves_ ^[Literally "to you"] a new heart and new spirit, and _so_ why will you die, house of Israel?

###### v32
For I have no pleasure in the death of the dying," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh. "And _so_ repent ^[Or "turn/return"] and live!"
