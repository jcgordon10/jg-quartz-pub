###### v1
"And you, raise a lament about ^[Or "over"] the leaders of Israel,

###### v2
and you must say,
'What a lioness _was_ your mother
among _the_ lions.
She lay down in the midst of young lions,
_and_ she reared her lion cubs.

###### v3
And she raised up one from her cubs;
he became a fierce lion,
and he learned to tear prey;
he ate ^[Or "devoured"] humans. ^[Hebrew "human"]

###### v4
And nations heard about him;
in their pit he was caught,
and they brought him with hooks
to the land of Egypt.

###### v5
And she saw ^[Or "realized"] that she was waiting _in vain_;
her hope was destroyed,
and she took one from her cubs,
_and_ she made him a fierce lion.

###### v6
And he walked about in the midst of lions;
he became a fierce lion,
and he learned to tear prey;
he ate ^[Or "devoured"] humans. ^[Hebrew "human"]

###### v7
And he knew their widows, ^[Or "ravished/raped"; or "he ravaged their strongholds"]
and he devastated their cities,
and _the_ land was appalled, and _everyone in it_ ^[Literally "its fullness"]
at the sound of his roar.

###### v8
And nations set out against him
_from the surrounding provinces_, ^[Literally "all around from _the_ provinces"]
and they spread their net over him,
and he was caught in their pit.

###### v9
And they put him in a collar with hooks,
and they brought him to the king of Babylon;
they brought him into ^[Hebrew "in"] a prison,
so that his voice _would_ not be heard _any longer_ ^[Literally "longer"]
on the mountains of Israel.

###### v10
Your mother _was_ like the vine in your vineyard; ^[Or "in the vineyard"]
planted _fruitfully_ ^[Literally "fruitful"] beside water,
and it was full of branches
from many waters. ^[Or "from waters abundant/many"]

###### v11
And _she produced branches of strength_ ^[Literally "they became to her branches/rods of strength"]
to ^[Or "for"] scepters of rulers;
its height became tall
between ^[Or "among"] thick foliage,
and it was seen ^[Or "visible"] because of its tallness
among the abundance of its branches.

###### v12
But it was uprooted in rage;
it was thrown to the earth,
and the east wind dried up its fruit;
they were stripped off,
and its strong branch dried up;
fire consumed it.

###### v13
And now _it is_ planted in the desert,
in a _dry and thirsty land_. ^[Literally "a land of dryness and thirst"]

###### v14
And _so_ fire has gone out from the stem of its branches;
its fruit it has consumed,
and _there_ was not in it _a strong branch_, ^[Literally "a branch of strength"]
a scepter for ruling.'"
This _is_ a lament, and _it will be used as a lament_. ^[Literally "she _is_ for a lament"]
