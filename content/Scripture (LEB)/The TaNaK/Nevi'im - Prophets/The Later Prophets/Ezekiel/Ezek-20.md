###### v1
And then in the seventh year, in the fifth _month_, on the tenth _day_ of the month, men from the elders of Israel came to consult Yahweh, and they sat _before me_. ^[Literally "to the face of"]

###### v2
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v3
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] speak with the elders of Israel, and you must say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "_Are_ you coming to consult me? _As I live_, ^[Literally "live I"] I will surely not allow myself ^[Or "me"] to be consulted by you!"' _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v4
Will you judge them? Will you judge _them_, son of man? ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] Make known to them the detestable things of their ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v5
And you must say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "On the day of my choosing Israel _I swore_ ^[Literally "and I raised my hand"] to the offspring of the house of Jacob, and I made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, and _I swore_ ^[Literally "and I raised my hand"] to them, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'I _am_ Yahweh your God.'

###### v6
On that day _I swore_ ^[Literally "I raised my hand"] to them to bring them out from the land of Egypt to _the_ land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey--it _is the most_ beautiful of all of the lands.

###### v7
Then I said to them, '_Let_ each _one_ throw away the detestable things of his eyes, and you must not make yourselves unclean with the idols of Egypt! I _am_ Yahweh your God.'

###### v8
But they rebelled against me, and they were not willing to listen to me; each _one_ _did not throw away_ ^[Literally "not they threw away"] the detestable things of their eyes; and _they did not abandon_ ^[Literally "not they abandoned"] the idols of Egypt, and I decided to pour out my rage on them, to fully vent my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

###### v9
"But ^[Or "And"] I acted for the sake of my name _to keep it from being profaned_ ^[Literally "not to be profaned before the eyes of"] before the eyes of the nations _among whom they lived_, ^[Literally "which they _were_ in their midst"] where I made known to them before their eyes, to bring them out from the land of Egypt.

###### v10
And I brought them out from the land of Egypt, and I brought them to the desert,

###### v11
and I gave my statutes to them, and my regulations I made known to them, which, if a person does them, then he will live by them.

###### v12
And also my Sabbaths I gave to them to be a sign between me and between them _so they would know_ ^[Literally "know"] that I, Yahweh, _am_ _the one_ sanctifying them.

###### v13
"But ^[Or "And"] in the desert the house of Israel rebelled against me; _they did not walk in my statutes_, ^[Literally "in my statutes not they went"] and they rejected my regulations, which, if a person does them, he will live by them, and they greatly profaned my Sabbaths, and I decided to pour out my rage on them in the desert to destroy them,

###### v14
and I acted for the sake of my name, _that it_ not be profaned before the eyes of the nations _before whom I brought them out_. ^[Literally "which I brought out them before their eyes"]

###### v15
And also _I myself swore_ ^[Literally "I, I raised my hand"] to them in the desert not to bring them into the land that I had given _to them_, flowing with milk and honey--it _is the most_ beautiful of all of the lands--

###### v16
because they despised my judgments, and _they did not walk in my statutes_, ^[Literally "and my statutes not they went in them"] and my Sabbaths they profaned, for their heart was going after their idols.

###### v17
But my eye took pity on them by not destroying them, and _I did not completely destroy them_ ^[Literally "and not I make them complete destruction"] in the desert.

###### v18
"And I said to their children in the desert, 'You must not go in the statutes of your parents; ^[Or "fathers"] you must not keep their regulations, and you must not make yourself unclean with their idols.

###### v19
I, Yahweh, _am_ your God, _so_ go in my statutes and keep my regulations and do them.

###### v20
And treat my Sabbaths as holy, and they will be a sign between me and between you _that you may know_ ^[Literally "know"] that I, Yahweh, _am_ your God.'

###### v21
But the children rebelled against me; _they did not walk in my statutes_, ^[Literally "in statutes my not they went"] and _they did not observe my regulations_, ^[Literally "my regulations not they kept to do them"] which _if_ a person does them, then he will live by them. My Sabbaths they desecrated, and I decided to pour out my rage on them, to finish my anger against them in the desert.

###### v22
But I withheld my hand, and I acted for the sake of my name not to be profaned before the eyes of the nations _before_ whom I _had_ brought them out before their eyes.

###### v23
What is more, _I swore_ ^[Literally "I will raise my hand"] to them in the desert to scatter them among the nations and to disperse them in the lands,

###### v24
because they did not _do_ my regulations, and my statutes they despised, and my Sabbaths they profaned, and their eyes were after the idols of their ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v25
And in turn I gave to them rules _that were_ not good and regulations _by which they will not live_. ^[Literally "regulations not they will live by them"]

###### v26
And I defiled them through their gifts in sacrificing all of _the_ first offspring of _the_ womb, in order that ^[Or "so that"] I will cause them to be stunned, so that they will know that I _am_ Yahweh.

###### v27
"Therefore speak to the house of Israel, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] and you must say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Again _in_ this your ancestors blasphemed me _at ^[Or "by"] their display of infidelity toward me_."' ^[Literally "at/in acting unfaithfully they against me in/by unfaithfulness"]

###### v28
And I brought them to the land that _I swore_ ^[Literally "I raised my hand"] to give ^[Hebrew "give it"] to them, and they saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and they offered their sacrifices, and they presented there the provocation of their offering, and they gave there their fragrant incense offering, and they poured out their libations there.

###### v29
And I said to them, 'What _is_ the high place ^[Hebrew Bamah, which became its name] to which you are going?' And _it is called_ ^[Literally "it is called name its"] Bamah until this day.

###### v30
Therefore thus say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "In the way of your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] _will_ you defile yourself, and after their vile idols _will_ you prostitute _yourselves_?

###### v31
And _when you lift up your gifts, sacrificing your children_ ^[Literally "at to lift up your gifts at causing to pass over your children"] through the fire, you are defiling yourself through all of your idols until _today_, ^[Literally "the day"] and will I let myself ^[Hebrew "me"] be consulted by you, house of Israel?"' _As I live_," ^[Literally "Live I"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, "I will not let myself ^[Hebrew "me"] be consulted by you!

###### v32
And _what you are planning_, ^[Literally "what is going up on your spirit"] surely it will not be--that you are saying, 'Let us be like the nations, like the clans ^[Or "tribes"] of the lands, _serving wood and stone_!' ^[Literally "to serve wood and stone"]

###### v33
"_As I live_," ^[Literally "live I"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, "_surely_ ^[Literally "if not"] with _a_ strong hand and with _an_ outstretched arm and with _rage pouring forth_ ^[Literally "rage poured out"] I will reign as king over you!

###### v34
And I will bring you from the peoples, and I will gather you from the countries _to_ which you were scattered with _a_ strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with rage poured out.

###### v35
Then I will bring you to the desert of the peoples, and I will execute justice on you there face to face.

###### v36
_Just as_ ^[Literally "Like what"] I executed justice on your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] in the desert of the land of Egypt, likewise I will execute justice on you!" _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v37
"And I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.

###### v38
And I will purge the rebels from _among_ you and the _ones_ transgressing against me; I will bring them out from the land _where they are living as aliens_, ^[Literally "from the land of living as an alien there"] but into the land of Israel they will not come, and _then_ you will know that I _am_ Yahweh.

###### v39
And you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord Yahweh: "_Let_ each one go serve his idols _now_ and after, if you _are_ not listening to me, but _my holy name_ ^[Literally "the name of my holiness"] you will not profane _any_ longer with your gifts and with your idols.

###### v40
"For on _my holy mountain_, ^[Literally "the mountain of my holiness"] on the mountain of the height of Israel," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, "there all of the house of Israel will serve me, all of them, ^[Hebrew "it/him"] in the land. I will take pleasure in them, and there I will accept your contributions and the best of your portions with all of your holy objects.

###### v41
I will accept you as _a fragrant incense offering_ ^[Literally "a fragrance of an incense offering"] when I bring you out from the peoples and I gather you from the lands _to_ which you were scattered, and I will show myself holy among you before the eyes of the nations.

###### v42
And you will know that I _am_ Yahweh _when I bring you_ to the land of Israel, to the land that _I swore_ ^[Literally "I raised my hand"] to give to your ancestors.

###### v43
And you will remember there your ways, and all of your deeds _by which you were made unclean_, ^[Literally "which you were made unclean by them"] and you will feel a loathing _for yourself_ ^[Literally "for your face"] for all of your evils that you have done.

###### v44
And you will know that I _am_ Yahweh _when I deal with you_ ^[Literally "at/in doing my with you"] for the sake of my name and _not according to your evil ways_ ^[Literally "not like your ways the evil"] or _according to_ ^[Literally "like"] your corrupted deeds, house of Israel," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] set your face _toward_ the way of _the_ south, ^[Or "Teman"] and preach to _the_ south, and prophesy against the forest of the territory of the Negev.

###### v47
And you must say to the forest of the Negev, 'Hear the word of Yahweh, thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Look! I am kindling against you a fire, and it will devour in you every fresh tree and every dry tree; _the_ blaze of _the_ flame will not be quenched, and all the surfaces from _the_ south _to_ _the_ north will be scorched by it.

###### v48
And all creatures will see that I, Yahweh, I kindled it--it will not be quenched!"'"

###### v49
Then I said, "Ah, Lord Yahweh, they are saying about me, '_Is_ he not posing a parable?'"
