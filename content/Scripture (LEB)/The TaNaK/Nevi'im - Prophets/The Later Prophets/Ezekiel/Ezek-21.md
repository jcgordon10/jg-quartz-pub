###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] set your face toward Jerusalem, and preach to _the_ sanctuaries, and prophesy to the land of Israel.

###### v3
And you must say to the land of Israel, 'Thus says Yahweh: "Look! I _am_ against you, and I will draw out my sword from its sheath, and I will cut _off_ from you _the_ righteous and _the_ wicked.

###### v4
Because ^[Hebrew "Because that"] I will cut _off_ from you _both_ righteous and wicked, therefore my sword will go out from its sheath to ^[Or "against"] all creatures ^[Hebrew "creature"] from south _to_ north.

###### v5
And they will know, all creatures, that I, Yahweh, I will bring out my sword from its sheath; it will not return again!"'

###### v6
And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] groan _with shaking hips_, ^[Literally "with destruction of loins"] and you must groan with bitterness before their eyes.

###### v7
_And then_ ^[Literally "and it will be"] when they say to you, 'On account of what _are_ you groaning?' then you must say, 'On account of _the_ report, for it _is_ coming, and every heart will be weak and all hands will hang limp and every spirit will be disheartened, and all knees will go _like_ water.' Look! It _is_ coming, and it will happen!" _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v8
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v9
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] prophesy, and you must say, 'Thus says the Lord,' say, 'A sword, a sword _is_ sharpened and _is_ also polished.

###### v10
It is sharpened to slaughter a slaughter, _polished to flash like lightning_! ^[Literally "so that there be for her lightning"] Or will we rejoice? ^[Or "be pleased"] A rod, my son, _is_ despising every tree. ^[Or "stick" of correction; Hebrew is uncertain in meaning here]

###### v11
And he gives it to be polished, _to be seized by the hand_. ^[Literally "to take hold of in the palm of the hand"] It is sharpened--a sword--and it _is_ polished to give it into _the_ hand of _the_ killer.

###### v12
Cry and wail, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] for it is against my people; it is against all of the princes of Israel. They are thrown to _the_ sword with my people; therefore _strike your thigh_. ^[Literally "strike on _the_ thigh"]

###### v13
For _examine_! ^[Literally "it was tested"] And what if also _the_ rod will not be despising?' _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v14
And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] prophesy _and clap your hands_. ^[Literally "strike hand to hand"] And the sword will _strike twice_; ^[Literally "be doubled"] let it happen a third time. It _is_ a sword of the dead, _the_ sword of the great dead that _is_ surrounding them,

###### v15
so that a heart melts, and the fallen _multiply_ ^[Literally "be made many"] at all of their gates. I gave a sword for slaughter, _and_ alas! It is made for flashing, it is grasped ^[Or "polished"] for slaughtering.

###### v16
Gather together, strike to the right; cause _to_ go to the left, where your _edge_ ^[Literally "face"] _is_ directed.

###### v17
And also _I myself_ ^[Literally "I, I"] will _clap my hands_, ^[Literally "strike my hand to my hand"] and I will satisfy my rage! I, Yahweh, I have spoken."

###### v18
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v19
"And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] mark _out_ for yourself ^[Hebrew "you"] two roads for the coming of the sword of the king of Babylon; they must _both_ ^[Literally "the two of them"] go out from the same land. And hew _out_ a _signpost_; ^[Literally "hand"] hew _it_ at _the_ head of _the_ road of _the_ city.

###### v20
You must mark a road for _the_ coming of _the_ sword _to_ Rabbah of the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] and _to_ Judah, in Jerusalem _the_ fortified.

###### v21
For the king of Babylon stands at the fork of the road at the head of the two roads to practice divination. _He shakes the arrows_, ^[Literally "he casts the lot with the arrows" (cf. NASB, NRSV)] he inquires with the teraphim, he _examines_ ^[Literally "sees with"] the liver.

###### v22
In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem, to put _up_ battering rams, to open _a_ mouth for slaughter, ^[Or "open the mouth of Sheol"; or "give the command to slaughter" (cf. NRSV, NASB)] _to raise the battle cry_, ^[Literally "to raise a voice in shouting"] to put _up_ battering rams against gates, to build a siege ramp, to build siege works. ^[Hebrew "siege work"]

###### v23
And it will be to them like practicing divination falsely ^[Or "in vain"] in their eyes; _they have sworn oaths for themselves_. ^[Literally "swearers of oaths _will be_ for them"] But ^[Or "And"] he _will_ bring _their_ guilt to remembrance _so as_ to seize them.

###### v24
"Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Because you have brought to remembrance your guilt by the uncovering of your transgressions, so that your sins in all of your deeds appear--because of your being remembered, you will be captured in the hand.'

###### v25
And _as for_ you, profane one, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come with _the_ time of _the_ punishment of _the_ end,

###### v26
thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Remove the turban and lift off the crown; things _are_ no longer the same. Exalt the low and bring low the high.

###### v27
A ruin, a ruin, a ruin I will make it! Also ^[Or "indeed"] this has not _ever_ happened; ^[Or "will not happen until" (cf. NASB and NRSV)] _it will remain_ until the coming of _the one_ _to_ whom the judgment belongs and I have given it _to him_.'

###### v28
And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] prophesy, and you must say, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] and concerning their disgrace,' and you must say, 'A sword, a sword _is_ drawn for slaughtering; _it is_ polished for holding, _for flashing like lightning_, ^[Literally "for the sake of lightening"]

###### v29
when seeing a false vision for you in vain, when practicing divination for you falsely, to give ^[Or "place"] you on _the_ neck of _the_ profane ones of _the_ wicked, _whose day has come_, ^[Literally "who has come their day"] _the time of final punishment_. ^[Literally "in _the_ time of _the_ punishment of _the_ end"]

###### v30
Return it to its sheath in _the_ place where you were created. In the land of your origin I will judge you!

###### v31
And I will pour out my anger on you; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and I will give you into _the_ hand of brutal men, skilled craftsmen of destruction.

###### v32
You will be as fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the earth. You will not be remembered, for I, Yahweh, I have spoken.'"
