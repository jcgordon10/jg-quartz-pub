Its priests treat my law violently, and they profane my holy objects; they do not distinguish between _a_ holy object and what is unholy, or between the clean and the unclean. They do not teach the difference, and they hide their eyes from my Sabbaths, and _so_ I am profaned in the midst of them.

Its officials _are_ like wolves tearing prey in its midst, to pour out blood, to destroy people, to make dishonest gain.
