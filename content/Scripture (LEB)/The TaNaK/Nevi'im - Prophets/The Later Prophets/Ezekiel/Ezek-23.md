###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] there were two women, _the_ daughters of one mother,

###### v3
and they prostituted _themselves_ in Egypt in their childhood; they were prostituting _themselves_ there, _and_ their breasts were fondled, and there they caressed the bosoms of their virginity.

###### v4
Now _as for_ their names, the older _was_ Oholah, and Oholibah _was_ her sister. And _they became mine_, ^[Literally "they were for me"] and they bore sons and daughters, and their names ^[Hebrew "name"] _are_ Samaria _for_ Oholah, and Jerusalem _for_ Oholibah.

###### v5
And Oholah prostituted _herself_ _while she was still mine_, ^[Literally "under me"] and she lusted for her lovers, for Assyria _who was_ nearby,

###### v6
clothed in blue cloth, governors and prefects, _handsome young men_ ^[Literally "young men of handsomeness/beauty"] _and_ all of them horsemen, _experts on horseback_. ^[Literally "riders _of_ horsemen"]

###### v7
And she bestowed her fornication on them, _on_ the choice _ones_ of the _Assyrians_, ^[Literally "sons of Assyria"] all of them, and with every one _after_ which she lusted; with all of their idols she defiled herself.

###### v8
And her whorings from _the time of_ Egypt she _did_ not abandon, for they slept with her in her childhood, and they caressed the bosoms of her virginity, and they poured out their fornication on her.

###### v9
Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the _Assyrians_ ^[Literally "sons of Assyria"] _after whom she lusted_. ^[Literally "which she lusted for them"]

###### v10
They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. And she became a name for the women, and they executed judgments against her.

###### v11
"And though Oholibah her sister saw, yet in her lust _she behaved more corruptly than her_, ^[Literally "she behaved corruptly _in_ lust from her"] and her whoring _was_ more than the prostitution of her sister.

###### v12
She lusted after the _Assyrians_, ^[Literally "sons of Assyria"] governors and prefects, warriors ^[Hebrew uncertain] clothed in ^[Or "to"] perfection, ^[Or "in full armor" or "wonderfully dressed"] _expert horsemen_, ^[Literally "horsemen, riders of horses"] all of them _handsome young men_. ^[Literally "young men of handsomeness"]

###### v13
And I saw that she was defiled; _they had both taken the same path_! ^[Literally "way one _was_ for the two of them"]

###### v14
And she increased her whorings, and she saw men carved ^[Or "portrayed"] on the wall, images of Chaldeans ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] carved in red,

###### v15
belted with a belt at ^[Or "around"] their waist with turbans on their heads, all of them _giving_ _the_ appearance of adjutants, ^[Or "officers"] the image ^[Or "likeness"] of the _Babylonians_; ^[Literally "sons of Babylon"] Chaldea _was_ the land of their birth.

###### v16
And she lusted for them _when her eyes saw them_, ^[Literally "at the sight of her eyes"] and she sent messengers to them _at_ Chaldea.

###### v17
And so the _Babylonians_ ^[Literally "sons of Babylon"] came to her _for the_ bed of lovemaking; and they defiled her with their fornication, and she was defiled by them, and she turned from them.

###### v18
And she revealed her whorings, and she revealed her nakedness, and so I turned from her _just as_ ^[Literally "as that"] I turned from her sister.

###### v19
Yet ^[Or "And"] she increased her whorings, _recalling_ ^[Or "remembering"] the days of her childhood when she was prostituted ^[Or "prostituted _herself_"] in the land of Egypt.

###### v20
And she lusted after her male lovers whose genitalia _were the_ genitalia of male donkeys and _their_ seminal emission _was the_ seminal emission of horses.

###### v21
And you longed _after_ the obscene conduct of your youth when your bosom was caressed by Egypt, fondling your young breasts.

###### v22
"Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Look! I _am_ stirring up your lovers against you _concerning_ whom you turned away, and I will bring them against you from all around:

###### v23
the _Babylonians_ ^[Literally "sons of Babylon"] and all of the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, all of the _Assyrians_ ^[Literally "sons of Assyria"] _along_ with them, _handsome young men_, ^[Literally "young men of beauty/handsomeness"] governors and prefects, all of them adjutants ^[Or "officers"] _and excellent horsemen_. ^[Literally "ones called riders of horses"]

###### v24
And they will come against you _with_ an army chariot and wagon and with a crowd ^[Or "horde" or "host of"] of peoples; they will set _themselves_ against you _from_ all around _with_ large shield and small shield and helmet. And I will give _before them_ ^[Literally "to the face of them"] judgment, and they will judge you with their judgments.

###### v25
And I will direct my zeal against you, and they will deal with you in anger; your nose and your ears they will remove, and _those who are left_, ^[Literally "and remainder your"] they will fall by the sword, and they will take your sons and your daughters, and _your remnant_ ^[Literally "and remainder your"] will be consumed by fire.

###### v26
And they will strip you _of_ your clothes, and they will take _your splendid jewelry_. ^[Literally "the jewelry of splendor your"; or "your beautiful jewelry"]

###### v27
And I will put an end to your obscene conduct _coming_ from you and your fornication from the land of Egypt, and you will not lift your eyes to them; and you will not remember Egypt again.'

###### v28
For thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Look! I _am_ giving you into the hand of those you hated, into the hand of those from whom ^[Literally "them"] you turned away.

###### v29
And they will deal with you in hatred, and they will take all of your acquisitions, and they will leave you naked and _in_ bareness; and the nakedness of your fornication and your obscene conduct and your whorings will be exposed.

###### v30
These _things_ _are_ accomplished ^[Or "done"] against ^[Hebrew "in"] you since you prostituted yourself after the nations, _and_ on account of that, you defiled yourself by their idols.

###### v31
You went in the _same_ way of your sister, and I will give her cup into your hand."'

###### v32
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "You will drink the deep and wide ^[Or place "drink deep and wide the cup"] cup of your sister; you will be as laughter and as scorn; _the cup holds so much_! ^[Literally "a large among to hold"]

###### v33
You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, for a cup of horror and desolation _is_ the cup of your sister, Samaria.

###### v34
And you will drink it, and you will drain _it_, and its potsherds you will gnaw, and you will tear out your breasts, for _I myself_ ^[Literally "I, I"] spoke," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v35
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Because you have forgotten me, and you threw me behind your back, now in turn ^[Or "also"] you bear your obscene conduct and your whorings."

###### v36
And Yahweh said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] will you judge Oholah and Oholibah and declare their abominable deeds to ^[Or "for"] them?

###### v37
For they committed adultery, and blood _is_ on their hands, and they committed adultery with their idols, and even their children that they had borne for me--they sacrificed them as food!

###### v38
Also they did this to me: they defiled my sanctuary on that day, and they profaned my Sabbaths,

###### v39
and when they slaughtered their children for their idols, they came to my sanctuary on that day to profane it. And look, _this is what they did in my house_! ^[Literally "thus they did in the midst of house my"]

###### v40
_What is worse_, ^[Literally "and also for/indeed"] they sent for men _who come_ ^[Literally "coming"] from a distant place, _to_ whom a messenger _was_ sent to them, and look! They came! _Men_ for whom you bathed and painted your eyes, and you adorned yourself _with_ an ornament.

###### v41
And you sat on a magnificent couch and a table prepared _before her_, ^[Literally "to the face of her"] and my incense and my olive oil you put on her. ^[Or "it"]

###### v42
And a sound of a carefree crowd _was_ with it, ^[Or "her"] and in addition to _these_ men, _a crowd of drunken men ^[A problematic verse; reading according to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] was brought in_ ^[Literally "from an abundance of men being brought in drunken"] from _the_ desert, ^[Or "wilderness"] and they put bracelets on their arms and a crown of splendor on their heads.

###### v43
And I said to ^[Or "about"] the one worn out _with_ adulteries, 'Now they will prostitute _her_ _concerning_ her fornication, even her.' ^[Or "that _she_ did"]

###### v44
And _so_ they went to her like going to a female ^[Or "a woman"] prostitute; and thus they went to Oholah and to Oholibah, the women of obscene conduct.

###### v45
But righteous men, they will judge them _with_ _the_ judgment of committing adultery, and _with_ _the_ judgment of shedding blood; for they were committing adultery, and blood _was_ on their hands."

###### v46
For thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Bring up against them an assembly, and make them as a thing of horror and as plunder.

###### v47
And an assembly must stone them _with_ stones, ^[Hebrew "stone"] and they must cut them down. With their swords they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and with fire they shall burn their houses.

###### v48
And _I will cause obscene conduct to cease from the land_, ^[Or "I will put an end to obscene conduct from the land"] and all of the women will be warned, and they will not do according to your wickedness.

###### v49
And they will repay your obscene conduct upon you, and the guilt of your idols you will bear, and you will know that I _am_ the Lord Yahweh.
