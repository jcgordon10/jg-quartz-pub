###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] set your face toward the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] and prophesy against them,

###### v3
and you must say to the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] 'Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Because of your saying, 'Ah!' to my sanctuary when it was profaned, and to the land of Israel when it was ^[Or "became"] desolate, and to the house of Judah when they went into the exile,

###### v4
therefore look! I _am_ giving you to the people ^[Or "children"] of the East as a possession, and they will set up their encampments in you, and they will make in you their dwelling places; _they themselves_ ^[Literally "they, they"] will eat your fruit and _they themselves_ ^[Literally "they, they"] will drink your milk.

###### v5
And I will make Rabbah as a pasture of camels and the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] as a haunt of flocks, and they will know that I _am_ Yahweh."'"

###### v6
For thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Because of clapping your hand and stamping with your foot, and _because_ you rejoiced in ^[Or "to"] yourself with all of your malice over the land of Israel,

###### v7
therefore look! I stretched out my hand against you, and I will give you as plunder ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] to the nations, and I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will destroy you from the countries, and I will wipe you out, and you will know that I _am_ Yahweh."

###### v8
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Because of Moab and Seir saying, 'The house of Judah _is_ like all of the nations,'

###### v9
therefore, look! I _am_ opening the side of ^[Or "the flank"] Moab from the cities on its frontier, _the_ glory of _the_ land: Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim.

###### v10
I will give it to the people ^[Or "children"] of the East in addition to the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] as a possession, so that the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] will not be remembered among the nations.

###### v11
And on Moab I will execute punishments, and they will know that I _am_ Yahweh."

###### v12
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Because of the doings of Edom in avenging himself _with_ vengeance for ^[Or "toward"] the house of Judah, and _so_ they became very guilty and ^[Or "since"] they avenged themselves on them,"

###### v13
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: "so ^[Literally "and"] I will stretch out my hand against Edom and I will cut off from it _both_ human and animal, and I will make it a ruin from Teman and Dedan; they will fall by the sword.

###### v14
And I will exact my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will do in Edom according to my anger and according to my rage, and they will know my vengeance," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v15
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Because of the _acting_ ^[Literally "doing"] of _the_ Philistines in vengeance, so that they avenged themselves relentlessly with malice in themselves for destruction _with everlasting hostility_, ^[Literally "_with_ hostility of ongoing ages/eternity"]

###### v16
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Look! I _am_ stretching out my hand against _the_ Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethites, and I will destroy the remainder of _the seacoast_. ^[Literally "the coast of the sea"]

###### v17
And I will execute on them great vengeance with punishments of rage, and they will know that I _am_ Yahweh when I exact my vengeance on them!"
