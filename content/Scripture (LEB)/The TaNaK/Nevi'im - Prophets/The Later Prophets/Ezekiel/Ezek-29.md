###### v1
In the tenth year, in the tenth _month_, on the _twelfth_ ^[Literally "two ten"] _day_ of the month, the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] set your face against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against Egypt, all of it.

###### v3
Speak, and you must say, 'thus says the Lord Yahweh:
"Look! I am against you,
Pharaoh, king of Egypt,
the great sea monster,
the _one_ lying down
in the midst of his Nile streams,
who says to me, "_It is_ my Nile, and I made _it_ _for_ myself." ^[Hebrew "me"]

###### v4
And so I will put hooks in your jawbones,
and I will make the fish of your Nile streams stick to your scales,
and I will bring you up from the midst of your Nile streams,
and all of the fish of your Nile streams _which_ cling to your scales.

###### v5
And I will fling you _to_ the desert,
you and all the fish of your Nile streams.
On the surface of the field you will fall;
you will not be gathered,
and you will not be assembled.
To the animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] of the field
and to the birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of the heavens
I will give you as food.

###### v6
And all of the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I _am_ Yahweh,
because of their ^[LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate: "you"] being a staff of reed for the house of Israel.

###### v7
When they took hold of you with the hand, you snapped,
and you split their every shoulder.
And when they leaned on you, you broke,
and you caused all of their loins to wobble."

###### v8
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Look! I _am_ bringing on you _a_ sword, and I will cut off from you human and animal.

###### v9
And the land of Egypt will become ^[Hebrew "be"] _a_ desolation and ruins, and they will know that I _am_ Yahweh because he ^[That is, Pharaoh] said, 'The Nile _is_ _mine_! ^[Literally "to me"] And I, I made _it_!'

###### v10
Therefore look! I _am_ against you and against your Nile streams, and I will make the land of Egypt into ruins, _a_ pile of rubble, _a_ desolation from Migdol _to_ Syene and up to the boundary of Cush.

###### v11
A foot of a human will not pass over it, and a foot of an animal will not pass over it, and so it will not be inhabited _for_ forty years. ^[Hebrew "year"]

###### v12
And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries, and its cities _to be_ in the midst of ruined cities. They will be _a_ desolation _for_ forty years, and I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will disperse them among the countries."

###### v13
For thus says the Lord Yahweh: "At the end of forty years I will gather Egypt from the peoples _among_ whom they were scattered.

###### v14
And I will restore the fortunes of Egypt, and I will bring them back _to_ the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and they will be a lowly kingdom there.

###### v15
Of _all_ the kingdoms it will be _the most_ lowly, and it will not exalt itself again over the nations, and I will make them small _so as_ not to rule over the nations.

###### v16
And it will not be again for the house of Israel an object of trust, bringing to remembrance _their_ guilt _when they turned back to them_, ^[Literally "at their turning"] and they will know that I _am_ the Lord Yahweh."

###### v17
_And then_ ^[Literally "and it happened"] in _the twenty-seventh year_, ^[Literally "twenty and seven year"] in the first _month_, on the first _day_ of the month, the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v18
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, he made his army labor hard against Tyre. Every head was rubbed bare, and every shoulder _was_ rubbed raw, but ^[Or "and"] a wage was not _paid_ for him and for his army from Tyre for the labor that he did against it."

###### v19
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Look! I _am_ giving to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon the land of Egypt, and he will carry its wealth _away_, and he will plunder its plunder, and he will loot its loot, and it will be _a_ wage for his army.

###### v20
_As_ his wages that he worked for, I will give to him the land of Egypt, because they worked for me," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v21
"On that day I will cause _power_ ^[Literally "a horn"] to grow _up_ for the house of Israel, and for you I will give an opening of _your_ mouth in the midst of them, and they will know that I _am_ Yahweh."
