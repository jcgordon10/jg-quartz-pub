###### v1
_And then_ ^[Literally "and it happened/it was"] _in the eleventh_ ^[Literally "on one ten"] year, in the third _month_, on the first _day_ of the month, the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] say to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to his crowd, ^[Or "hordes"]
'To whom are you like in your greatness?

###### v3
Look! Assyria _was_ a cedar in Lebanon,
_with_ beautiful branches ^[Hebrew "branch"] and a forest giving shade,
and _very high_, ^[Literally "high of height"]
and its treetop _was_ between _the_ clouds.

###### v4
Waters made it great,
the deep made it grow high;
its rivers _were_ going all around _its planting area_, ^[Literally "base of its tree"; NRSV, "in the place where it was planted"]
and its channels it sent _out_
to all of the trees of the field.

###### v5
Therefore it became tall,
_with_ its height more than all of the trees of the field,
and its branches became numerous,
and its branches became long
_from its sending its shoots from abundant water_. ^[Literally "from water much at sending _shoots_ its"]

###### v6
In its branches all the birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of the heaven ^[Or "sky"] made their nest,
and under its branches all the animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] of the field gave birth,
and in its shadow all _the_ many nations lived.

###### v7
And it was beautiful in its greatness,
in the length of its branches,
for its root _was_ toward much water.

###### v8
Cedars in the garden of God
could not _be_ equal to it;
fir trees ^[Or possibly, juniper] could not resemble its branches,
and plane trees were not _even_ like its branches;
any tree _even_ in the garden of God
could not resemble it in its beauty.

###### v9
I made it beautiful with the abundance of its branches,
and all of the trees of Eden that _were_ in the garden of God envied it.'"

###### v10
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: "_Because_ ^[Literally "because that"] it was tall in height and it set its treetop between ^[Hebrew "to between"] thick clouds, and _he took pride in his tallness_, ^[Literally "and his heart he raised in his tallness"]

###### v11
then ^[Or "and"] I gave it into _the_ hand of _the_ leader of nations; he _dealt thoroughly_ ^[Literally "doing he did"] with it according to its wickedness. I drove it _out_.

###### v12
And strangers cut it off, _the most_ ruthless of nations, and they abandoned it. On the mountains and in all _of the_ valleys its branches fell, and its branches were broken in all the river channels of the land, and all the peoples of the world went out from its shadow, and they abandoned it.

###### v13
On its fallen trunk all the birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of the heaven ^[Or "sky"] _now_ dwell, and all the animals of the field were on its branches.

###### v14
_This occurred_ so that all of _the_ trees _with abundant_ water will not become tall, and they will not set their treetop between ^[Or "among"] _their_ thick foliage, ^[Or "clouds"] and _so that__all of the trees that are abundantly watered_ ^[Literally "all of _the_ drinkers of water"] _will not stand up to them_ ^[Literally "will not stand to them"] in their tallness, for all of them, they have been given _over_ to death, to _the_ world below in the midst of _mortals_, ^[Literally "sons of men," or "children of humankind"] to _the people_ going down to the grave." ^[Or "pit"]

###### v15
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "On the day of its going down _to_ Sheol, I caused mourning; I covered over it _with_ the deep, and I withheld its rivers, and many waters were restrained, and I brought gloom over it; Lebanon and all of the trees of the field, they _had_ fainted because of it.

###### v16
From the sound of its downfall I caused nations to shake when I made it go down to Sheol, with _the people_ going down to _the_ grave, ^[Or "the pit"] and _so_ in _the_ world below all of the trees of Eden, _the_ choice and the best of Lebanon, _all the well-watered trees_ ^[Literally "all _of__the_ drinkers of water"] were comforted!

###### v17
They also went down with it to Sheol to _those who died by the sword_, ^[Literally "to the slain of _the_ sword"] and its army _who_ _had_ lived in its shadow in the midst of nations.

###### v18
_To whom could you be compared, whether in glory or in majesty_ ^[Literally "To who you are like as in glory and in majesty"] among the trees of Eden? And yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to _the_ world below; in the midst of _the_ uncircumcised you will lie with _those who died by the sword_. ^[Literally "the slain of _the_ sword"] That is Pharaoh and _his entire_ ^[Literally "all his hordes/crowd"] crowd!" ^[Or "hordes"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.
