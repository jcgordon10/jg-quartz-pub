###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] speak to _your people_, ^[Literally "the children of your people"] and you must say to them, 'A land, if I bring over it a sword and the people of the land take a man, one from their number, and they appoint him for them as a watchman,

###### v3
and he sees the sword coming against the land, and he blows on the horn and he warns the people,

###### v4
and _anyone who listens_ ^[Literally "the listening"] hears the sound of the horn and _he does not take warning_ ^[Literally "not he takes warning"] and _the_ sword comes and it takes him, his blood will be on his _own_ head.

###### v5
_For_ he heard the sound of the horn and he did not take warning; his blood will be on him. But _if_ he took warning, he saved his life.

###### v6
And _as for_ the watchman, if he sees the sword coming and _he does not blow_ ^[Literally "and not he blows on"] the horn, and the people _are_ not warned, and _the_ sword comes and it takes _their lives_, ^[Literally "it takes from them a life"] he will be taken through his guilt, but his blood from the hand of the watchman I will seek.'

###### v7
"And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; if you hear a word from my mouth, then you must warn them from me.

###### v8
_When I say_ ^[Literally "At my saying"] to the wicked, 'Wicked _one_, you will certainly die,' and you _did not speak_ ^[Literally "and not you spoke"] to warn _the_ wicked from his way, he, _the_ wicked, will die by his guilt, but his blood I will seek from your hand.

###### v9
But, you, if you warn _the_ wicked from his way, to turn from it, and _he does not turn_ ^[Literally "and not he turns"] from his way, he will die by his guilt, and you will have saved your life.

###### v10
"And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] say to the house of Israel, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'So you said, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "Indeed, our transgressions and our sins _are_ on us, and because of them we _are_ rotting, and how can we live?"'

###### v11
Say to them, '_As I live_,' ^[Literally "live I"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, '_Surely I have no delight_ ^[Literally "if"] in the death of the wicked, _except_ ^[Literally "for it"] in _the_ wicked returning from his way, and he lives. Turn back! Turn back from your ways, O evil _ones_, for why should you die, house of Israel?'

###### v12
"So ^[Or "And"] you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] say to _your people_ ^[Literally "the children of your people"] _that_ the righteousness of the righteous shall not save him in the day of his transgression, and the wickedness of the wicked _will not cause him to stumble_ ^[Literally "not he will stumbled by it"] on the day of his returning from his wickedness; and _the_ righteous will not be able to live by it on the day when he returns to his sin.

###### v13
When I say to the righteous, 'Certainly he will live,' and he trusted in ^[Or "on"] his righteousness, and he _turns and he_ does injustice, all of his righteousness ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] will not be remembered, and because of his injustice that he did, because of it he will die.

###### v14
And when I say to the wicked, 'Certainly you will die,' but ^[Or "and"] he returns from his sin and he does justice and righteousness--

###### v15
_for example_, _the_ wicked returns a pledge for a loan, he restores _stolen property_, ^[Literally "robbed/stolen _items_"] he goes in the statutes of life _so as_ not to do injustice--certainly he will live; he will not die.

###### v16
All of his _sins that he committed_, ^[Literally "sins that he sinned"] they will not be remembered against ^[Or "for"] him, and he did justice and righteousness; certainly he will live.

###### v17
"Yet ^[Or "And"] _your people_ ^[Literally "the children of your people"] say, 'The way of the Lord is not fair!' _yet_ their way is not fair.

###### v18
When _the_ righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice, then he will die _because of it_. ^[Literally "by/in them"]

###### v19
And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and he does justice and righteousness, because of it ^[Hebrew "them"] _he will certainly live_! ^[Literally "he, he will live"]

###### v20
Yet you said, 'The way of the Lord is not fair!' I will judge you, house of Israel, each _person_ according to his ways."

###### v21
_And then_ ^[Literally "and it happened"] it was in _the twelfth_ ^[Literally "two of ten"] year, in the tenth _month_, on the fifth _day_ of the month of our exile, a survivor from Jerusalem came to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "The city was destroyed!"

###### v22
And the hand of Yahweh was on me on the evening _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the coming of the survivor, and he opened my mouth _before the survivor came to me in the morning_, ^[Literally "until coming to me in the morning"] and my mouth was opened, and I was _no longer_ ^[Literally "and not I was dumb still"] dumb. ^[Or "silent" or "speechless"]

###### v23
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v24
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] the inhabitants of these ruins on the soil of Israel _are_ saying, 'Abraham was one _man_, and he took possession of the land, and we _are_ many; the land has been given for ^[Or "to"] us as _a_ possession.'

###### v25
Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "You eat blood _in your meat_, and you raise your eyes to your idols and you pour out blood, and _yet_ you want to take possession of the land? ^[Or "you would take possession of"]

###### v26
You rely on your sword, you do a detestable thing, and _each man defiles_ ^[Literally "a man the wife of neighbor you defile"] the wife of his neighbor, and _yet_ you want to take possession of the land?"' ^[Or "you would take possession of the land"]

###### v27
"Thus you must say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "_As I live_, ^[Literally "I live"] _surely_ ^[Literally "if not"] whoever _is_ in the ruins, by the sword they will fall, and whoever _is_ on the surface of the open field, I will give him to the animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] to eat him, and whoever _is_ in the stronghold and in the cave, they will die by the plague.

###### v28
And I will make the land _a_ desolation and _a_ wasteland, and the pride of its strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will be desolate _with no one traveling through them_."' ^[Literally "from there is not _someone_ going over"]

###### v29
And they will know that I _am_ Yahweh when I make my land _a_ desolation and _a_ wasteland, because of all of their detestable things that they have done.

###### v30
"And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] _your people_, ^[Literally "the children of your people"] the ones talking together concerning you beside the walls and in the doorways of the houses, each one with his brother _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Please come and hear what _is_ the word _that is going out from Yahweh_.' ^[Literally "the going out from with Yahweh"]

###### v31
And they come to you _as people do_, ^[Literally "like _the_ coming of a people"] and they sit _before you_, ^[Literally "to the face of you"] and my people hear your words, and they do not do them, for they _are_ showing ^[Or "expressing"] passion in their mouth, but their heart _is_ going after ill-gotten gain.

###### v32
Now, look! You _are_ to them like _a sensual song_, ^[Literally "like a song of lust"] beautiful of voice and _played well on an instrument_, ^[Literally "doing good to play a music instrument"] and they hear your words, _but they are not doing them_. ^[Literally "and/but doing there is not they them"]

###### v33
So ^[Or "And"] _when it comes_, ^[Literally "in/at her coming"] look! It is coming! And _then_ they will know that a prophet was in the midst of them."
