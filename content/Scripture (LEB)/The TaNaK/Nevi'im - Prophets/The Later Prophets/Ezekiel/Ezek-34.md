###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_,

###### v2
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and you must say to them, to the shepherds, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Woe _to_ the shepherds of Israel who were feeding themselves! Must not the shepherds feed the flock?

###### v3
The fat you eat, and you clothe _yourself_ _with_ the wool; the well-nourished _animals_ you slaughter, _but_ you do not feed the flock.

###### v4
The weak you _have_ not strengthened, and the sick you _have_ not healed, and _with respect to_ ^[Literally "for"] the hurt ^[Or "wounded"] you have not bound _them up_, and you _have_ not brought back the scattered, and you _have_ not sought the lost, but _rather_ you ruled over them with force ^[Or "violence"] and with ruthlessness.

###### v5
And they were scattered _without_ ^[Literally "from not"] a shepherd, and they were ^[Or "became"] as food for all the animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] of the field _when_ they were scattered.

###### v6
My flock went astray upon all of the mountains and on every high hill, and _so_ upon all the surface of the world ^[Or "earth"] my flock were scattered, and _there was no one seeking them_, ^[Literally "there was not _someone_ seeking _them_"] and _there was no one searching for them_." ^[Literally "there was not _someone_ searching for _them_"]

###### v7
Therefore, hear, _O_ shepherds, the word of Yahweh:

###### v8
"_As I live_," ^[Literally "live I"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, "_Surely_ ^[Literally "if not"] because my flock have become as plunder, and my flock became as food to ^[Or "for"] all the animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] of the field, since there was not a shepherd, _since_ my shepherds _have_ not sought my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and they fed not my flock,'"

###### v9
therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh,

###### v10
'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Look! I _am_ against the shepherds, and I will seek my flock from their hand, and I will put an end to them from shepherding flocks, and the shepherds will _no longer_ ^[Literally "not _any_ longer"] feed themselves, and I will deliver my flocks from their mouth, so that they will not be as food for them."

###### v11
"'For thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Look! I, even I, will seek my flock, and I will look after them,

###### v12
_just_ like _the_ caring of a shepherd _for_ his herd on ^[Or "in"] the day when he is in the midst of his scattered flock. Thus I will look after my flock, and I will deliver them from all the places _to which they were scattered_ ^[Literally "which they were scattered there"] on _the_ day _of storm and stress_. ^[Literally "on _the_ day of cloud and deep gloom"]

###### v13
And I will bring them out from the peoples, and I will gather them from the countries, and I will bring them to their soil, and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the valleys, and in all of the settlements of the land.

###### v14
I will feed them in good pasture, and their pasture will be on the mountains of the heights of Israel; there they will lie down in good pasture, and _on_ lush pasture they will feed on the mountains of Israel.

###### v15
_I myself_ ^[Literally "I, I"] will feed my flock and _I myself_ ^[Literally "I, I"] will allow them to lie down," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v16
"I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the scattered, and I will bind _up_ the one hurt, and I will strengthen the sick; and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed her with justice."

###### v17
"'And you, my flock, thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Look! I _am_ judging between _one sheep and another_, ^[Literally "small sheep and small sheep"] between the rams and between the he-goats.

###### v18
_Is it not enough for you_ ^[Literally "is it _too_ little from you"] _that_ you feed on the good pasture? And _still_ you must trample the remainder of your pasture with your feet, and _clear water_ ^[Literally "and settling of water"] you drink, and the _leftover water_ ^[Literally "_water_ being left"] you must make muddy with your feet.

###### v19
And my flock must graze the _pasture_ treaded upon by ^[Hebrew "of"] your feet, and must drink the mud puddle _stirred up_ by ^[Hebrew "of"] your feet."

###### v20
"'Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh to them: "Look! I, even I will judge between fat sheep and between lean sheep,

###### v21
because with _your_ flank and with _your_ shoulder you shoved, and with your horns you pushed all of the sick _animals_ _until_ ^[Literally "until that"] you scattered it ^[Or "them"] to the outside.

###### v22
And _so_ I will save my flock, and _they will no longer be_ ^[Literally "not they will be longer for plunder"] for plunder, and I will judge between _one sheep and another_. ^[Literally "sheep and sheep"]

###### v23
And I will set up over them one shepherd, and he will feed them; _that is_, my servant David. He will feed them, and he will be for them as ^[Or "like"] a shepherd.

###### v24
And I, Yahweh, I will be for them _as God_, ^[Literally "to a God"] and my servant David _will be_ a leader in the midst of them. I, Yahweh, I have spoken.

###### v25
And I will make them a covenant of peace, and I will put an end to wild animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] from the land, and they will dwell in the desert _safely_, ^[Literally "with confidence/trust"] and they will sleep in the forest.

###### v26
And I will make them and _the area_ all around my hill a blessing, and I will let the rain go down _at its appointed time_; ^[Literally "in time his"] they will be rains of blessing.

###### v27
And the tree ^[Or "trees"] of the field will give its fruit, and the land will give its produce, and they will be on their land _safely_, ^[Literally "with/in conficence"] and they will know that I _am_ Yahweh when I break their yoke, and I will deliver them from the hand of the ones enslaving them.

###### v28
And they will not be _any_ longer plunder to the nations, and the animals of the land will not eat them, and they will dwell _in safety_, ^[Literally "with confidence"] and _there will_ not _be anyone_ frightening _them_.

###### v29
And I will raise for them a garden plot ^[Or "planting"] of renown, and they will _no longer_ ^[Literally "not _any_ longer"] be victims of famine in the land, and they will not bear any more the insult of the nations.

###### v30
And they will know that I, Yahweh their God, _am_ with them and they _are_ my people, the house of Israel," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh,

###### v31
"and you _are_ my flock, the flock of my pasture. You _are_ _my people_; ^[Literally "humanity, Mankind, human, mankind"] I _am_ your God," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.'"
