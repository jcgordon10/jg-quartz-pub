###### v1
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] set your face against the mountain of Seir and prophesy against it,

###### v3
and you must say to it, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Look! I am against you, mountain of Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you _a_ desolation and _a_ wasteland.

###### v4
Your cities I will make ruins, and you will be _a_ desolation, and _then_ you will know that I _am_ Yahweh,

###### v5
because there _has been_ to you _an ancient hostility_, ^[Literally "enmity of eternity"] and you handed over the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] to _the_ power of _the_ sword at the time of their disaster, at the time of _their final punishment_. ^[Literally "_the_ time of punishment of end"]

###### v6
Therefore _as I live_," ^[Literally "live I"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, "Certainly to blood _guilt_ I will prepare you and blood ^[Or "blood vengeance"] will pursue; _since_ ^[Literally "if not"] _you did not hate blood_, ^[Literally "not blood you hated"] it will pursue you.

###### v7
And I will make the mountain of Seir into _a_ desolation and ruin, and I will cut off from it _both_ _he who is_ crossing over and _he who is_ returning.

###### v8
And I will fill its mountains _with_ its slain; your hills and your valleys and all of your watercourses, the slain by _the_ sword will fall in them.

###### v9
_An everlasting desolation_ ^[Literally "of eternity/endless ages"] I will make you, and your cities will not return, and you will know that I _am_ Yahweh.

###### v10
_I do this_ because of your saying, ^[Or "thinking"] 'The two nations and the two lands, they will be _mine_, ^[Literally "to me"] and we will take possession of it,' and _yet_ Yahweh was there.

###### v11
Therefore, _as I live_," ^[Literally "live I"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, "so I will deal _with you_ according to your anger and according to your jealousy that you did, ^[Or "showed" or "acted on"] because of your hatred against them, and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.

###### v12
And you will know that I, Yahweh, I have heard all of your contemptible words that you said ^[Or "spoke"] against the mountains of Israel, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'They will be desolate; they are given to us as food.'

###### v13
And you magnified yourself against me with your _insolent speech_, ^[Literally "with your mouth"] and you spoke voluminously against me _with_ your words--I heard!

###### v14
Thus the Lord Yahweh says, '_As the whole world rejoices_, ^[Literally "as/like _the_ rejoicing of all of the world"] I will make you _a_ desolation.

###### v15
_Like your rejoicing over the inheritance of the house of Israel_ ^[Literally "as/like rejoicing your for the inheritance of the house of Israel"] _because_ ^[Literally "because that"] it was desolate, I will do to you; you will be _a_ desolation, mountain of Seir and all of Edom, indeed all of it; and they will know that I _am_ Yahweh.'"'
