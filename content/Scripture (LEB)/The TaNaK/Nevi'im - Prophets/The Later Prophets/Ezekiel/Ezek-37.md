###### v1
The hand of Yahweh was upon me, and he brought me by the Spirit of Yahweh, and he _let me rest_ ^[Or "placed me"; literally "set me"] in the midst of the valley, and it _was_ full of bones.

###### v2
And he led me _all around_ ^[Literally "all around, all around"] over them, and look, very many on the surface of the valley, and look, very dry.

###### v3
And he said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] can these bones live?" And I said, "Lord Yahweh, you know."

###### v4
And he said to me, "Prophesy to these bones, and you must say to them, _to_ the dry bones, 'Hear the word of Yahweh!

###### v5
Thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones: "Look! I _am_ bringing into you breath, and you will live!

###### v6
And I will lay on you sinews, and I will let flesh come upon you, and I will cover you over _with_ skin, and I will put breath into you, and you will live, and you will know that I _am_ Yahweh."'"

###### v7
And I prophesied _just as_ ^[Literally "as that"] I had been commanded, and _there_ was a sound at my prophesying, and look! A rattling, and they came together--_the_ bones! Bone to its bone!

###### v8
And I looked, and indeed, sinews _were_ on them, and flesh went up, ^[Or "appeared"] and skin covered over ^[Or "on"] them _upward_, ^[Literally "from to above"] but breath _was_ not in them.

###### v9
And he said to me, "Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] and you must say to the breath, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh _from the four winds_, ^[Literally "from four winds"] "Come, O spirit and breath, on these dead ones, so that they may live!"'"

###### v10
And I prophesied _as_ ^[Literally "like what"] he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they became alive, and they stood on their feet, a very, very large group.

###### v11
And he said to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] these bones _are_ all of the house of Israel; look! _they are_ saying, 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope is destroyed; _we are cut off as far as we are concerned_.' ^[Literally "we are cut in two for us"]

###### v12
Therefore prophesy, and you must say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Look! I _am_ opening your graves, and I will bring you up from your graves, my people, and I will bring you to the land of Israel!

###### v13
And you will know that I _am_ Yahweh when I open your graves when I bring you up from your graves, my people!

###### v14
And I will put my breath into you so that you may live, and I will cause you to rest on your soil, and you will know that I, Yahweh, I have spoken, and I will act!"' _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh."

###### v15
And the word of Yahweh _came_ ^[Literally "was"] to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v16
"And you, son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] take for yourself _a piece of wood_, ^[Literally "_a piece of_ wood one"] and write on it, 'For Judah and for the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] his associates,' and take another _piece of_ wood, and write on it, 'For Joseph, _the piece of_ wood of ^[Or "for"] Ephraim and all of the house of Israel his associates.'

###### v17
And join them one to _the_ other with respect to you _as_ one _piece of_ wood, so that they may become one in your hand.

###### v18
_When_ ^[Literally "as that"] _your people_ ^[Literally "the children of your people"] say to you, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Will you not inform us _as to_ what these _actions_ mean for you?'

###### v19
_Then_ speak to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Look! I _am_ taking _the piece of_ wood for Joseph that _is_ in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of Israel its associates, and I will put them on it, _the piece of_ wood of Judah, and I will make them into one _piece of_ wood, so that they be one in my hand.'"

###### v20
And the _pieces of_ wood _on_ which you wrote will be in your hand before their eyes.

###### v21
And speak to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Look! I _am_ taking the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] from among _the nations to which they went_, ^[Literally "which they went there"] and I will gather them from _everywhere_, ^[Literally "all around"] and I will bring them to their _own_ soil.

###### v22
And I will make them into one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and _they will all have one king as their king_, ^[Literally "and king one he will be for all of them to king"] and they ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] will not again be two nations and will not again divide into two kingdoms again.

###### v23
And they will not defile themselves again with their idols and with vile idols and with all of their transgressions, and I will save them from all of their apostasy _by which they sinned_, ^[Or "which they sinned by them"] and I will cleanse them and they will be for me as a people and I, I will be for them as God.

###### v24
"'"And my servant David _will be_ king over them, and one shepherd will be for all of them, and in my regulations they will go, and my statutes they will observe, and they will do them.

###### v25
And they will dwell on the land that I gave to my servant, to Jacob, _in which your ancestors dwelled_, ^[Literally "which they dwelt in it your fathers"] and they will dwell on it, they and their children and the children of their children _forever_, ^[Literally "until eternity" or "until unlimited time"] and my servant David _will be_ a leader for them _forever_. ^[Literally "to eternity" or "to endless ages"]

###### v26
And I will make with them a covenant of peace; _an everlasting covenant_ ^[Literally "a covenant of eternity"] it will be with them. And I will establish them, and I will cause them to increase, and I will put my sanctuary in the midst of them _forever_. ^[Literally "to eternity" or "to unlimited ages"]

###### v27
And my tabernacle will be with them, and I will be for them as God, and they will be to me as a nation.

###### v28
And the nations will know that I, Yahweh, _am_ consecrating Israel when my sanctuary _is_ in the midst of them _forever_."'" ^[Literally "to eternity" or "to unlimited ages"]
