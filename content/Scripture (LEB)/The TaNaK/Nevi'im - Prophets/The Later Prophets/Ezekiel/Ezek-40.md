###### v4
And the man spoke to me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] look with your eyes and listen with your ears and apply ^[Or "set/put"] your heart to all that I _am_ showing you, for you were brought here in order to show you _this_; tell all that you _are_ seeing to the house of Israel."
