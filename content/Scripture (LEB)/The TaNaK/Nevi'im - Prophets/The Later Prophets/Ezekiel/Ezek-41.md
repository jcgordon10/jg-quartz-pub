###### v1
And he brought me to the temple _sanctuary_, ^[Or "main room" (of the temple of Jerusalem); "great hall" (JPS); "outer sanctuary" (NIV); word can refer to surrounding courts and halls; HALOT 245.] and he measured the pilasters, _six cubits ^[That is, 10.5 feet] wide on each side_; ^[Literally "six cubits wide from here and six cubits wide from here"] _this was_ the width of the tent. ^[Or "of the jambs"]

###### v2
And the width of the doorway _was_ ten cubits, ^[That is, 17.5 feet] and the sidewall of the doorway _was five cubits on each side_, ^[Literally "_was_ five cubits from here and five cubits from here"; five cubits = 8.75 feet] and he measured its ^[That is, the outer sanctuary] length _as_ forty cubits, ^[That is, 70 feet] and _its_ width _was_ twenty cubits. ^[That is, 35 feet]

And _each level_ widened, and it went around ^[Or "was surrounded"] _upward_ ^[Literally "to above, to above"] to the side rooms for the structure that surrounds ^[Or "goes around"] the temple _upward_ ^[Literally "to above, to above"] _all the way around_, ^[Literally "all around, all around"] therefore _the_ width _increased_ to the temple _upward_, ^[Literally "to above"] and thus the lower _level_ goes up to the upper _level_ by _means of_ the middle story.
