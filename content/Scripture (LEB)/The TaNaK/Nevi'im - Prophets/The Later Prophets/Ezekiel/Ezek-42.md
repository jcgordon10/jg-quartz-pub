###### v1
And he brought me out to the outer courtyard _to the north_, ^[Literally "_to_ the way of the north"] and he brought me to the chamber which _was_ opposite the courtyard and which _is_ opposite the building to the north.

###### v2
_As_ to ^[Or "along the face of"] _the_ face of _the_ length _of the building_ _with_ the doorway to the north, _it_ _was_ a hundred cubits, ^[That is, 175 feet] and its ^[Or "the"] width _was_ fifty cubits. ^[That is, 87.5 feet]

###### v3
Opposite the twenty _cubits_ _of the inner courtyard_, ^[Literally "which _were_ to the courtyard the inner"] and opposite _the_ pavement that _was_ to the outer courtyard _was_ a gallery _facing_ ^[Literally "to_ward_ in the face/front of"] a gallery in the three _stories_.

###### v4
And _in front of_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the chambers _was_ a passageway ten cubits ^[That is, 17.5 feet] _in_ width toward the inside, a walkway of one cubit, ^[One cubit of 18–21 inches is problematic; LXX and Syriac read 100 cubits (175 feet) running the length of the building] and their doorways _were_ to the north.

###### v5
And the upper chambers narrowed, for _the_ galleries took away _space_ from them more than _they took_ from the lower _levels_ and more than _they took_ from the middle _level_ _in the_ building.

###### v6
For they ^[Or "there"] _were_ three stories and _they had no pillars_ ^[Literally "there were not for them pillars"] like ^[Or "as"] the pillars of ^[Or "for"] the courtyards; therefore they were smaller than the lower _stories_ and than the middle _stories_ from the ground _up_.

###### v7
And _there was_ a wall that was to the outside _alongside_ ^[Literally "to the outside to corresponding"] the chambers _on_ the walkway to ^[Or "of"] the outer courtyard ^[That is, "to the north"] _in front of_ ^[Literally "to in face of"] the chambers; its length _was_ fifty ^[That is, 87.5 feet] cubits. ^[Hebrew "cubit"]

###### v8
For ^[Or "while"] the length of the chambers which _were_ to the outer courtyard _was_ fifty ^[Hebrew "cubit"] cubits, ^[That is, 87.5 feet] and look! ^[Or "yet!"] _The chambers_ on the front of the temple _were_ a hundred ^[Hebrew "cubit"] cubits. ^[That is, 175 feet]

###### v9
And from under these chambers _was_ the entrance ^[Reading the Ketiv] from the east for them _when one enters_ ^[Literally "at/in his/its coming"] from the outer courtyard.

###### v10
All along the width of the wall of the courtyard _eastward_ ^[Literally "on the way of the east"] in front of the courtyard to the front of the building _were_ chambers.

###### v11
And a walkway _was_ _before them_ ^[Literally "was to the face of them"] like the appearance of the chambers which _were on_ _the north_, ^[Literally "_were on_ the way of the north"] _just_ like _them in_ their length, _and_ so _was_ their width and all their exits, and _they were built_ like their arrangements and like their doorways,

###### v12
and like the doorways of the chambers which _were on_ the way of the south _was_ _a_ doorway at the head of the way ^[Dropping one "way"] _before_ the stone wall, projecting ^[Or "protecting wall"] _on_ ^[Or "toward"] the way of the east at their coming. ^[That is, when people entered the complex]

###### v13
And he said to me, "The chambers of the north _and_ the chambers of the south which _are_ _before_ ^[Literally "to the front of"] the courtyard, they _are the holy chambers_ ^[Literally "_are_ the chambers of the holiness"] in which the priests, who _are_ near to Yahweh, will eat the _most holy objects_. ^[Literally "holy objects of the holy objects"] There they shall put the _most holy objects_, ^[Literally "holy objects of the holy objects"] and the grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering, for the place _is_ holy.

###### v14
_When the priests enter_, ^[Literally "at coming their"] then they shall not go out from the sanctuary to the outer courtyard; and there they must put ^[Or "deposit/leave/remove"] their garments in which they serve because they _are_ holy. They must put on other garments and _then_ they may approach _the area_ that _is_ for the people.

###### v15
And he completed the measurements of the inner temple, and he brought me _to_ the walkway of the gate _that faces toward the east_ ^[Literally "which its face _is to_ the way of the east"] and he measured it _all the way around_. ^[Literally "all around, all around"]

###### v16
He measured the east side with the reed ^[Or "rod"] for ^[Literally "of measuring"] measuring, five hundred cubits, ^[Hebrew has "reeds" here (= 5,250 feet), which is not correct; 500 cubits = 875 feet.] with _respect to_ reeds with the reed for measurement, _he measured it_ all around.

###### v17
He measured the north side _as_ five hundred _cubits_, _with respect to_ reeds with the reed for measurement all around.

###### v18
_Then_ he measured the south side _as_ five hundred _cubits_, _with respect to_ reeds with the reed for measurement.

###### v19
He went around the west side ^[Or "side toward/to the sea"] _and_ he measured five hundred _cubits_, _with respect to_ reeds with the reed for measurement.

###### v20
_Toward the four sides_ ^[Literally "toward the four winds"] he measured it; _there_ _was_ a wall for it _all the way around_. ^[Literally "all around, all around"] _Its_ length _was_ five hundred _cubits_ ^[That is, 875 feet] and _its_ width _was_ five hundred _cubits_, in order to make _a_ separation between what is holy and what is common.
