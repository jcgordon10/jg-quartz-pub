###### v3
And ^[Or "and as"; as is not needed in translation] the appearance of the vision which I saw _was_ as ^[Or "like"] the vision which I saw at his ^[Or "my coming"] coming to destroy the city, and _these_ visions _were_ _also_ as ^[Or "like"] the vision which I saw by the _Kebar River_, ^[Literally "river of Kebar"] and I fell on my face.

_When they placed their threshold_ ^[Literally "in/at their placing their threshold"] with ^[Or "beside/next to"] my threshold, their doorframe beside my doorframe and the ^[Or "their"] wall _was_ between me and between them, then they defiled _my holy name_, ^[Literally "the name of my holiness"] with their detestable things that they did, and _so_ I consumed them in my anger.
