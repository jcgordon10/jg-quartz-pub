And when you allocate the land as an inheritance, you shall provide a contribution for Yahweh _as_ a holy portion from the land, _its_ length _being_ twenty-five thousand _cubits_ ^[Or 8.33 miles] and _its_ width ten thousand _cubits_; ^[Hebrew 3.5 miles; LXX reads 6.67 miles in width, or 20,000 cubits (cf. 45:3, 5; 48:9)] it _is_ holy in all its territory, all around.

###### v2
And _there_ shall be from this _area_ five hundred _cubits_ ^[That is, "875 feet by 875 feet"] by five hundred _cubits_, squared all around, for the sanctuary; and fifty cubits ^[Hebrew "cubit"] ^[That is, "87.5 feet"] _of_ open space _shall be_ for it all around _it_.

###### v3
And from this measured area you shall measure a length of twenty-five ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] thousand _cubits_ ^[That is, 8.33 miles; cf. 45:5] and a width of ten thousand _cubits_, ^[That is, 3.5 miles; cf. 45:5] and in it will be the sanctuary, _the most holy place_. ^[Literally "the holiness of holinesses"]

###### v4
It ^[Or "this area"] _is_ a holy portion from the land; it will be for the priests, the servants of the sanctuary _who approach_ ^[Literally "the ones who approach"] to serve Yahweh, and it will be for them a place for houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.

###### v5
And _an area_ twenty-five thousand _cubits_ _in_ length and ten thousand _cubits_ _in_ width will be for the Levites, the servants of the temple. _It will serve_ _as_ property for them _as cities to dwell in_. ^[Literally "twenty chambers"]

And _as_ property of the city, you must set apart alongside the contribution of the sanctuary _a portion_ five thousand _cubits_ ^[That is, 1.67 miles] in width and twenty-five thousand _cubits_ ^[That is, 8.33 miles] in length, _and_ it shall be for the entire house of Israel.

###### v11
The ephah and the bath shall be one unit of measurement; ^[Or "shall be the same size"] the tenth part of the homer _is_ the bath, and the tenth of the homer _is_ the ephah; _so_ the homer shall be its ^[Or "the"] unit of measurement.

And the shekel _shall weigh_ twenty gerahs, twenty shekels ^[Hebrew "shekel"] and five and twenty shekels ^[Hebrew "shekel"] _and_ ten and five shekels, ^[Hebrew "shekel"] _that_ shall make the mina for you. ^[Meaning of Hebrew uncertain]

###### v14

###### v18
