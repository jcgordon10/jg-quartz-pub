###### v1
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "The gate of the inner courtyard facing east must be shut _on_ ^[Or "during"] the six of the days for work, but on the day of the Sabbath it must be opened and on the day of the new moon it must be opened.

###### v2
And the prince shall come _by_ way of the portico of the gate from _the_ outside, and he shall stand at the doorframe of the gate and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his fellowship offerings, and he shall bow down at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be closed until the evening.

###### v3
And the people of the land will bow down _at_ the doorway of that gate on the Sabbaths and on the new moons _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] Yahweh.

###### v4
And the burnt offering which the prince will offer to Yahweh on the Sabbath day _must be_ six male lambs without defect and a ram without defect.

###### v5
And _the_ grain offering _he will give_ _shall be_ an ephah _for each ram_, ^[Literally "to the ram"] and for the male lambs _the_ grain offering _shall be_ _as much as he wants to give_ ^[Literally "the gift of his hand"] and a hin of olive oil _for each ephah_. ^[Literally "to the ephah"]

###### v6
And on the day of the new moon _he will offer_ a bull, _a calf_ ^[Literally "son of cattle," or "son of _the_ herd"] without defect and six male lambs and a ram; they must be without defect.

###### v7
And an ephah for each bull and an ephah for the ram he must provide _as_ a grain offering, and _also_ for the male lambs _as much as he can afford_ ^[Literally "as that it stretches out his hand"] and a hin _of_ olive oil for each ephah.

###### v8
And when the prince comes, on ^[Or "by"] the way of the portico of the gate he shall come and by this ^[Or "his"] way he shall go out.

###### v9
And when the people of the land come _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] Yahweh at the festivals, _the_ one coming _by_ way of _the_ gate of _the_ north to bow down ^[Or "to worship"] must go out _by_ _the_ way of _the_ gate of _the_ south, and the _one_ coming _by_ way of _the_ gate of _the_ south must go out _by the_ way of _the_ gate of _the_ north, _so_ he must not return _by_ the way of the gate _by_ which he came, ^[Hebrew "came by it"] but before it he ^[According to the reading tradition (_Qere_)] shall go out opposite it.

###### v10
And the prince _will be_ in the midst of them; he will come in when they come in, and when they go out he will go out.

###### v11
And at the festivals and at the appointed times, the grain offering will be an ephah with a bull and an ephah with the ram and with the male lambs, _as much as he wants to give_, ^[Literally "the gift of his hand"] and a hin of olive oil _for each ephah_. ^[Literally "to the ephah"]

###### v12
And when the prince makes a freewill offering, a burnt offering, or a fellowship offering _as_ a freewill offering to Yahweh, the gate facing east will be open for him. And he must offer his burnt offering and his fellowship offering _just as_ ^[Literally "as that"] he does on the day of the Sabbath, and _then_ he must go out and the gate will shut _after he goes out_. ^[Literally "after his going out"]

###### v13
And a male lamb, _a yearling_ ^[Literally "a son of his year"] without defect, he must provide as a burnt offering _daily_ ^[Literally "for the day"] for Yahweh; _every morning_ ^[Literally "in the morning in the morning"] he must provide it.

###### v14
And _a_ grain offering he must provide in addition to it _every morning_, ^[Literally "in the morning in the morning"] a ^[Hebrew "the"] sixth of an ^[Hebrew "the"] ephah and a third of a hin of olive oil to moisten the finely milled flour _as_ a grain offering to Yahweh _as a perpetual statute_. ^[Literally "regulations of everlasting continually"]

###### v15
_So_ they must provide the male lamb and the grain offering and the olive oil _every morning_ ^[Literally "in the morning in the morning"] _as a regular burnt offering_." ^[Literally "as burnt offering of regularity/continuity"]

###### v16
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "If the prince gives a gift to any _one_ from _among_ his sons, it _is_ his inheritance _and_ it will belong ^[Hebrew "be"] to his sons; it is their possession as an inheritance.

###### v17
And if he give a gift from his inheritance to one from _among_ his servants, then it will belong ^[Hebrew "be"] to him until the year of release, ^[That is, the Year of Jubilee] and _then_ it will return to the prince. His inheritance _with respect to_ his sons will be only for them.

###### v18
But the prince shall not take from the inheritance of the people to rob ^[Or "oppress"] them, _separating them_ from their property; from his _own_ property he shall bestow an inheritance on his sons, so that my people will not be driven away, any one, from his property."

###### v19
Then he brought me through the entrance which _was_ on the side of the gate _to the holy chambers_ ^[Literally "to the chamber of the holiness"] to the priests; _the chambers_ were facing northwards and, look, there _was_ a place at the extreme end westwards.

###### v20
And he said to me, "This _is_ the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, _and_ where they shall bake the grain offering _in order_ not to bring _them_ out to the outer courtyard to make the people holy.

###### v21
And he brought me to the outer courtyard and led me past the four corners of the courtyard; and look, _there was a courtyard in each corner of the courtyard_. ^[Literally "a courtyard in the corner of the courtyard, a courtyard in the corner of the courtyard"]

###### v22
In the four corners of the courtyard _were_ small ^[Hebrew uncertain] courtyards forty _cubits_ _in_ length and thirty _cubits_ _in_ width, _each with_ _the same measurements_ ^[Literally "measurement one"] for the four of them with corners. ^[Or "_being_ cornered"]

###### v23
And a row _was_ all around inside ^[Hebrew "in"] them, and cooking-places _were_ made under the rows of stones ^[Possibly some kind of stone ledge] all around.

###### v24
And he said to me, "These _are_ the houses for ^[Hebrew "of"] cooking, where _the ones_ serving the temple shall cook the sacrifices of the people."
