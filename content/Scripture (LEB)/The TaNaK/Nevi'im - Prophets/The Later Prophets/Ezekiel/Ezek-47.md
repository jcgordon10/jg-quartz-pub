###### v1
And he brought me back to the doorway of the temple and, look! There was water coming out from under the threshold of the temple eastward, because the face of the temple _was_ eastwards; and the water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, from south of the altar.

###### v2
And he brought me out _by the way_ of _the_ north gate and he led me around _by the_ _way leading to the outside of the outer gate_ ^[Literally "way of _the_ outside to the gate of the outside"] _by_ way of the _gate_ facing east, and look, there was water trickling from the south side.

###### v3
As the man went eastward a measuring line _was_ in his hand, and he measured a thousand _cubits_. ^[Literally "in the cubit"; about 1,750 feet] And he led me through _on_ into the water; _it was_ _ankle deep_. ^[Literally "water of ankles"]

###### v4
And he measured a thousand _cubits_, ^[About 1,750 feet] and he brought me over into the waters _and_ _it was_ _knee deep_. ^[Literally "water of knees"] And he measured a thousand _cubits_, ^[About 1,750 feet] and he brought me over _into_ the waters _and_ _it was_ _waist deep_. ^[Literally "water of waist"]

###### v5
And he measured a thousand _cubits_, ^[About 1,750 feet] _and_ _it became_ a stream that I was not able to cross, because the water rose, _waters a person could swim in_, ^[Literally "water of swimming"] _and became_ a stream that could not be crossed.

###### v6
And he asked me, "Son of man, ^[Or "mortal," or "son of humankind"] did you see _this_?" And he made me go, and he brought me back _along_ the bank of the stream.

###### v7
_When I returned_, ^[Literally "At my returning"] then look! On the bank of the river _were_ many trees _on both sides_. ^[Literally "from this and from this"]

###### v8
And he said to me, "These waters _are_ going out to the eastern region, and they go down to the _Jordan Valley_, ^[Literally "Arabah"] and they come _to_ the sea ^[Clearly refers to the Dead Sea] _and flow_ into the sea _where_ _they issue out_, ^[Literally "being brought out/are issued out"] and the waters _in the sea_ will be healed. ^[Or "made fresh"]

###### v9
And then every living creature _with_ which it teems, ^[Or "swarms"] _to every place the waters come_ ^[Literally "to all of which they come there the water"] it will live; _and_ very many fish will live because these waters came there, and _so_ the _water_ will be healed ^[Or "fresh"] and everything _will be_ alive _everywhere that_ ^[Literally "all that"] _the stream will come_. ^[Literally "that _it_ will come there the stream"]

###### v10
And then fishers ^[Or "fishermen"] from En Gedi and _on_ up to En Eglaim will stand beside it, a sea-girt drying yard for nets; their fish for the dragnets will be _of every kind_, ^[Literally "to the"] like the fish of the great sea, ^[That is, the Mediterranean] _and_ very many.

###### v11
But its marshes and its swamps will not be cured, for they were given for salt.

###### v12
And along the stream will go up on its banks _from both sides_ ^[Literally "from this and from this"] every tree _producing food_; ^[Literally "of food"] its leaf will not wither and it will not cease _producing_ its fruit. _Every month_ ^[Literally "for its months"] it will bear early fruit, for its waters _are_ going out from the sanctuary, and its fruit will be as food, and its leaf for healing."

###### v13
Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "This _is_ the boundary _by_ which you shall distribute the land for _the twelve_ ^[Literally "two ten"] tribes of Israel: Two shares _shall be for_ Joseph.

###### v14
And you must take possession of it, each _one_ _a share_ like his brother, _of this land_ which _I swore_ ^[Literally "I raised my hand"] to give it to your fathers, and _so_ this land shall fall to you as an inheritance.

###### v15
And ^[Or "Bow"] this _is_ the boundary of the land: _On the north side_, ^[Literally "to the side of _the_ north"] from the great sea _by_ the way of Hethlon _until you come to Zedad_, ^[Literally "to the arriving at Zedad"]

###### v16
Hamath ^[Or "Lebo-Hamath to Zeded" (cf. NRSV, NJPS)] _to_ Berothath _to_ Sibraim, which _is_ ^[Or "are"] between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Hamath, _on to_ Hazer Hatticon, which _is_ on the boundary of Hauran.

###### v17
And _so_ _the_ boundary will be from the sea ^[That is, the Mediterranean] to Hazar Enan _at_ the boundary of Damascus northwards and the boundary of Hamath _to the north_, and this _is the boundary on the_ side of _the_ north.

###### v18
_And the eastern boundary_ ^[Literally "and _the_ side of _the_ east"] _will be_ between Hauran and Damascus, and from between Gilead and the land of Israel _along_ the Jordan _River_ from ^[Or "to"] _the_ boundary on the eastern sea to Tamar. And ^[Or "Now"] _this is the border on the east_. ^[Literally "and this _is the_ side of _the_ east"]

###### v19
_And on the south side the border_ ^[Literally "and the side of the south _to_ south"] _will run_ from Tamar up to the waters _of_ Meribot Kadesh _and along_ the wadi ^[That is, the Wadi of Egypt] to the Great Sea. ^[That is, the Mediterranean] And this _is_ _the boundary to the south_. ^[Literally "and this _is_ the side of south _to_ the south"]

###### v20
_And on the west side_ ^[Literally "and the side of the west"] the Great Sea ^[That is, the Mediterranean] _shall be_ the boundary up to opposite Lebo-Hamath. _This is the western boundary_. ^[Literally "this _is the_ side of _the_ west"]

###### v21
You shall divide this land for yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.

###### v22
And then you shall allocate it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens dwelling as aliens in the midst of you who have children in the midst of you, and _so_ they shall be to you _just_ like full citizens among the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] With you they shall be allotted with an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.

###### v23
And then in the tribe _in_ which an alien who is with you dwells, there you shall give his inheritance," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.
