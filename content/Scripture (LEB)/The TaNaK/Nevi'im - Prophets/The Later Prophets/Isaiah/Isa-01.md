[[Isa-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, _and_ Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

###### v2
Hear, heavens,
and listen, earth,
for Yahweh has spoken:
"I reared children
and I brought _them_ up,
but they rebelled against me.

###### v3
An ox knows its owner
and a donkey the manger of its master.
Israel does not know;
my people do not understand.

###### v4
Ah, sinful nation,
a people heavy _with_ iniquity,
offspring of evildoers,
children who deal corruptly.
They have forsaken Yahweh;
they have despised the holy one of Israel.
They are estranged _and gone_ backward.

###### v5
Why do you want to be beaten again?
You continue _in_ rebellion.
_The_ whole of _the_ head _is_ sick,
and _the_ whole of _the_ heart _is_ faint.

###### v6
From the sole of the foot and up to _the_ head
there is no health in it;
bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed,
and they have not been bound up
and not softened with the oil.

###### v7
Your country _is_ desolate,
your cities _are_ burned _with_ fire;
_As for_ your land, aliens are devouring it in your presence,
and _it is_ desolate, like devastation _by_ foreigners.

###### v8
And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard,
like a shelter in a cucumber field,
like a city that is besieged. ^[Or "preserved"]

###### v9
If Yahweh of hosts had not left us survivors, ^[Hebrew "survivor"]
we would have been as few as Sodom,
we would have become like Gomorrah.

###### v10
Hear the word of Yahweh, rulers of Sodom!
Listen _to_ the teaching of our God, people of Gomorrah!

###### v11
What _is the_ abundance of your sacrifices to me? says Yahweh.
I have had enough _of_ burnt offerings of rams
and _the_ fat _of_ fattened animals
and I do not delight in _the_ blood of bulls
and ram-lambs and goats.

###### v12
When you come to appear before me,
who asked for this from your hand:
you trampling my courts?

###### v13
You must not _continue_ ^[Literally "increase" or "add to"] to bring offerings ^[Hebrew "offering"] of futility,
incense--it _is_ an abomination to me;
new moon and Sabbath, _the_ calling of a convocation--
I cannot endure iniquity with _solemn_ assembly.

###### v14
Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates;
they have become to me like _a_ burden,
I am not able to bear _them_.

###### v15
And when you stretch out your hands,
I will hide my eyes from you;
even though you make many prayers, ^[Hebrew "prayer"]
I _will_ not be listening.
Your hands are full of blood.

###### v16
Wash! Make yourselves clean!
Remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes!
Cease to do evil!

###### v17
Learn to do good!
Seek justice! Rescue _the_ oppressed!
Defend _the_ orphan! Plead for _the_ widow!

###### v18
"Come now, and let us argue," says Yahweh.
"Even though your sins are like scarlet, they will be white like snow;
even though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.

###### v19
If you are willing and you are obedient,
you shall eat the good of the land.

###### v20
But if you refuse and you rebel, you shall be devoured _by the_ sword.
For the mouth of Yahweh has spoken."

###### v21
How has a faithful city become like a whore?
Full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.

###### v22
Your silver has become _as_ dross;
Your wine _is_ diluted with waters.

###### v23
Your princes _are_ rebels
and companions of thieves.
Every one loves a bribe
and runs after gifts.
They do not defend _the_ orphan
and _the_ legal dispute of _the_ widow does not come before them.

###### v24
Therefore, the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel:
"Ah, I will be relieved of my enemies,
and I will avenge myself on my foes.

###### v25
And I will turn my hand against you;
I will purify your dross like lye,
and I will remove all _of_ your tin.

###### v26
And I will restore your judges, as at the first,
and your counselors, as at the beginning.
After this _you will be called_ ^[Literally "it will be called for you"] the city of righteousness,
faithful city.

###### v27
Zion will be redeemed by justice,
and those of her who repent, by righteousness.

###### v28
But _the_ destruction _of_ rebels and sinners _shall be_ together,
and those who forsake Yahweh will perish.

###### v29
For you ^[Literally "they," but a few manuscripts read "you," which fits the context better] will be ashamed of _the_ oaks _in_ which you delighted,
and you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.

###### v30
For you shall be like an oak withering its leaves,
and like a garden where there is no water for her.

###### v31
And the strong _man_ shall become like tinder,
and his work like a spark.
And both of them shall burn together,
and there is not one to quench _them_."
