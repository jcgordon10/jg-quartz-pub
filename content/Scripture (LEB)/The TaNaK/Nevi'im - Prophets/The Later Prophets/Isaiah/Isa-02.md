###### v1
The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:

###### v2
And it shall happen in the future of the days
the mountain of the house ^[Or "temple"] of Yahweh _shall_ be established;
it will be among the highest ^[Literally "head"] of the mountains,
and it shall be raised from _the_ hills.
All _of_ the nations shall travel to him;

###### v3
    many peoples shall come.
And they shall say,
"Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
to the house ^[Or "temple"] of the God of Jacob,
and may he teach us part of his ways,
and let us walk in his paths."
For instruction shall go out from Zion,
and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.

###### v4
He shall judge between the nations
and he shall arbitrate for many peoples.
They shall beat their swords into ploughshares
and their spears into pruning hooks.
A nation shall not lift up a sword against a nation,
and they shall not learn war again.

###### v5
House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.

###### v6
For you have forsaken your people, house of Jacob,
because they are full ^[Possibly "of diviners" was part of the original text here] from _the_ east,
and _of_ soothsayers like the Philistines,
and _they make alliances_ ^[Literally "they clap _hands_"] with the offspring of foreigners.

###### v7
And its land is filled _with_ silver and gold,
and there is no end to its treasures;
and its land is filled _with_ horses,
and _there is_ no end to its chariots.

###### v8
Its land is filled _with_ idols;
they bow down to the work of their ^[Hebrew "his"] hands,
to what they made _with_ their ^[Hebrew "his"] fingers.

###### v9
So humanity is humbled;
everyone is humbled,
and you must not forgive them.

###### v10
Enter into the rock
and hide yourself in the dust
from the presence of the terror of Yahweh
and from the glory of his majesty.

###### v11
The _haughty eyes_ ^[Literally "eyes of the haughtiness"] of humanity will ^[The Hebrew is singular] be brought low,
and the pride of everyone will be humbled,
and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day.

###### v12
For _there is_ a day for Yahweh of hosts
against all of _the_ proud and _the_ lofty
and against all that is lifted up and humble, ^[Or "it will be humbled"]

###### v13
and against all the lofty and lifted up cedars of Lebanon,
and against all the large trees of Bashan,

###### v14
and against all the high mountains,
and against all the lofty hills,

###### v15
and against every kind of high tower,
and against every kind of fortified wall,

###### v16
and against all the ships of Tarshish,
and against all the ships of desire.

###### v17
And the haughtiness of the people shall be humbled,
and the pride of everyone shall be brought low,
and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day.

###### v18
And the idols shall pass away entirely,

###### v19
and they will enter into _the_ caves of _the_ rocks
and into _the_ holes of _the_ ground
from the presence of the terror of Yahweh
and from the glory of his majesty
_when he rises_ ^[Literally "in his rising"] to terrify the earth.

###### v20
On that day humanity will throw away its idols of silver
and its idols of gold,
which they made for it to worship,
to the rodents ^[Or "moles"] and to the bats--

###### v21
to enter into the crevices of the rocks
and into the clefts of the crags
from the presence of the terror of Yahweh
and from the glory of his majesty,
_when he rises_ ^[Literally "in his rising"] to terrify the earth.

###### v22
Turn away from humanity,
who _has_ breath in its nostrils, ^[Hebrew "nostril"]
for by ^[Or "in"] what _is_ it esteemed?
