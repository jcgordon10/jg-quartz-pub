###### v1
For look, the Lord Yahweh of hosts _is_ removing _every source of support_ ^[Literally "supplies and supplies"]
from Jerusalem and from Judah:
all of _the_ supplies of bread
and all of _the_ supplies of water,

###### v2
mighty warrior and man of war,
judge and prophet,
and diviner and elder,

###### v3
captain of fifty and the honorable men of rank,
and counselor and skillful magicians and skillful enchanter.

###### v4
And I will make boys their princes,
and children shall rule over them.

###### v5
And the people will be oppressed _by each other_ ^[Literally "man by man"]
and a man by his neighbor.
The boy will act arrogantly toward the elder,
and the dishonorable toward the honorable.

###### v6
Indeed, a man will seize his brother
_in_ the house of his father:
"_You have a cloak_; ^[Literally "a cloak for you"]
you shall be a leader for us,
and this heap of ruins _shall be_ under your hand!"

###### v7
He will lift up _his voice_ on that day, saying,
"I will not be a healer;
in my house there is no bread
and there is no cloak.
You shall not make me _the_ leader of _the_ people!"

###### v8
For Jerusalem has stumbled,
and Judah has fallen
because their speech and their deeds _are_ against Yahweh,
defying the eyes of his glory.

###### v9
The look on their faces testifies against them
and they declare their sin like Sodom;
they do not hide _it_.
Woe to their soul!
For they have dealt out evil to themselves.

###### v10
Tell _the_ innocent ^[Singular] that _it is_ good
for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.

###### v11
Woe to the wicked! ^[Singular] _It is_ bad!
For what is done _by_ his hands will be done to him.

###### v12
My people--children are their oppressors,
and women rule over them.
My people, your leaders are misleading _you_,
and they confuse the course of your paths.

###### v13
Yahweh takes his stand to conduct a legal case
and takes his stand to judge _the_ peoples.

###### v14
Yahweh enters into judgment with the elders of his people and its princes.
"And you! You have devoured the vineyard;
the spoil of the poor _is_ in your houses!

###### v15
_Why_ ^[Literally "What to you"] do you crush my people
and grind _the_ face of _the_ poor?"
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh of hosts.

###### v16
And Yahweh said: "Because ^[There are two Hebrew words for "because" here] the daughters of Zion are haughty,
and they walk _with_ outstretched neck,
and they give flirting glances _with their_ eyes,
_mincing along as they go_, ^[Literally "they go walking and mincing along"]
and _with their feet they rattle their bangles_, ^[Literally "they tinkle with their feet"]

###### v17
the Lord will make the heads ^[Hebrew "head"] of the daughters of Zion scabby,
and Yahweh will lay their foreheads bare."

###### v18
In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets
and the headbands and the crescent necklaces,

###### v19
the pendants and the bracelets and the veils,

###### v20
    the headdresses and the armlets and the sashes,
and the _perfume boxes_ ^[Literally "houses of _the_ breath"] and the amulets,

###### v21
    the signet rings and the nose rings,

###### v22
the festal robes and the mantles,
and the cloaks and the handbags,

###### v23
and the mirrors and the linen garments,
and the turbans and the wraps.

###### v24
And this shall happen: There will be
a stench instead of perfume,
and a rope instead of a sash,
and baldness instead of a well-set hairdo,
and a clothing wrap of sackcloth instead of a rich robe,
branding instead of beauty.

###### v25
Your men shall fall by the sword,
and your warriors in battle.

###### v26
And her ^[That is, Jerusalem's] gates shall lament and mourn,
and she shall be banished;
she shall sit upon the ground.
