###### v1
And seven women shall grasp at one man on that day, saying,
"We will eat our own bread,
and we will wear our own clothing;
only _let us be called by your name_! ^[Literally "let your name be called upon us"]
Take away our disgrace!"

###### v2
On that day the branch of Yahweh shall become beautiful and glorious,
and the fruit of the land _shall become the_ pride and glory of the survivors ^[Hebrew "survivor"] of Israel.

###### v3
And this shall happen: He who is left in Zion
and he who remains in Jerusalem will be called holy,
everyone written for life in Jerusalem,

###### v4
when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion
and cleansed the blood of Jerusalem from her midst
by a spirit of judgment
and by a spirit of burning.

###### v5
Then Yahweh will create over all of the site ^[Or "place"] of _Mount Zion_ ^[Literally "the mountain of Zion"]
and over her assembly a cloud by day
and smoke and the brightness of flaming fire _by_ night.
Indeed, over all _the_ glory _there will be_ a canopy,

###### v6
    and it will be a shelter for shade from _the_ heat by day,
and a refuge and a hiding place from rainstorm and from rain.
