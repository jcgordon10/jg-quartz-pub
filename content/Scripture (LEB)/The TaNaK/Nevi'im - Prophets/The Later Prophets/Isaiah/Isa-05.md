###### v1
Let me sing for my beloved
a song of my love concerning his vineyard:
_My beloved had a vineyard_ ^[Literally "A vineyard was for my beloved"] on _a fertile hill_. ^[Literally "a horn of a son of olive oil." The Hebrew for horn, _qeren_, sounds like the Hebrew for vineyard, _kerem_]

###### v2
And he dug it and cleared it of stones,
and he planted it _with_ choice vines, ^[Hebrew "vine"]
and he built a watchtower in the middle of it,
and he even hewed out a wine vat in it,
and he waited for _it_ to yield grapes--
but it yielded wild grapes.

###### v3
And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem
and men ^[Hebrew "man"] of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.

###### v4
What more _was there_ to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it?
Why did I hope for _it_ to yield grapes, and it yielded wild grapes?

###### v5
And now let me tell you what I myself am about to do to my vineyard.
_I will_ remove its hedge, and it shall become a devastation.
_I will_ break down its wall, and it shall become a trampling.

###### v6
And I will make it a wasteland;
it shall not be pruned and hoed,
and it shall be overgrown _with_ briers ^[Hebrew "brier"] and thornbushes. ^[Hebrew "thornbush"]
And concerning the clouds, I will command _them not to send_ ^[Literally "from sending"] rain down upon it.

###### v7
For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts _is_ the house of Israel,
and the man ^[Or "people"] of Judah _is_ the plantation of his delight.
_And_ he waited for justice, ^[The Hebrew word, _mishpat,_ sounds like _mishpakh_ in the next line]
but look! Bloodshed! ^[The Hebrew word, _mishpakh_, sounds like _mishpat_ in the previous line]
For righteousness, ^[The Hebrew word, _tsedaqah,_ sounds like _tsa`aqah_ in the next line]
but look! A cry of distress! ^[The Hebrew word, _tsa`aqah,_ sounds like _tsedaqah_ in the previous line]

###### v8
Ah! Those who _join_ ^[Literally "touch"] house with house,
they join field together with field
until _there is no place_ ^[Literally "an end of place"]
and you are caused to dwell alone in the midst of the land.

###### v9
Yahweh of hosts _said_ in my ears:
_Surely_ ^[Literally "If not"] many houses shall become a desolation,
large and beautiful _ones_ without inhabitant.

###### v10
For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, ^[A bath is a liquid measure]
and _the_ seed of a homer will yield an ephah. ^[An ephah is a dry measure equal to one-tenth of a homer]

###### v11
Ah! Those who rise early in the morning,
they pursue strong drink.
Those who linger in the evening,
wine inflames them.

###### v12
And _there_ will be lyre and harp,
tambourine and flute,
and wine _at_ their feasts,
but they do not look at the deeds ^[Hebrew "deed"] of Yahweh,
and they do not see the work of his hands.

###### v13
Therefore my people will go into exile without knowledge,
_and_ their ^[Hebrew "its"] nobles ^[Hebrew "noble"] _will be_ men of hunger,
and their ^[Hebrew "its"] multitude _is_ parched _with_ thirst.

###### v14
Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat,
and it has opened wide its mouth without limit,
and her ^[That is, Jerusalem's] nobles ^[Hebrew "noble"] will go down, and her multitude,
her tumult and those who revel in her.

###### v15
And humankind is bowed down,
and man is brought low,
and _the_ eyes of _the_ haughty are humiliated.

###### v16
But Yahweh of hosts is exalted by justice,
and the holy God shows himself holy by righteousness.

###### v17
And then _the_ lambs will graze as _in_ their pasture,
and _fatlings, kids ^[Following the Septuagint, which reads the Hebrew _grym_ (resident aliens) as _gdym_ (young goats/sheep)] will eat among the sites of ruins._ ^[Literally "and ruins, fatlings, resident aliens, will eat"]

###### v18
Ah! Those who drag iniquity along with the cords of falsehood
and sin as with rope of the cart,

###### v19
those who say,
"Let him make haste;
let him hurry his work
so that we may see it
and let it draw near
and let the plan of the holy one of Israel come
so that we may know _it_!"

###### v20
Ah! Those who call evil good and good evil,
those who put darkness for light and light for darkness,
those who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!

###### v21
Ah! _Those who are_ wise in their own eyes
and have understanding _in their view_! ^[Literally "before their faces"]

###### v22
Ah! Heroes at drinking wine,
and men of capability at mixing strong drink!

###### v23
Those who acquit the guilty because of a bribe
and remove _the_ justice of _the_ innocent from him.

###### v24
Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,
and dry grass sinks down _in the_ flame,
so their root will become like _the_ stench,
and their blossom will go up like _the_ dust.
For they have rejected the instruction of Yahweh of hosts,
and they have treated the word of the holy one of Israel with contempt.

###### v25
Therefore _Yahweh's wrath was kindled_ ^[Literally "the anger of Yahweh became hot"] against his people,
and he stretched out his hand against them ^[Hebrew "it"] and struck them, ^[Hebrew "it"]
and the mountains quaked,
and their corpses ^[Hebrew "corpse"] were like refuse in _the_ middle of _the_ streets.
In all of this his anger has not turned back,
and still his hand is stretched out.

###### v26
And he will raise a signal for a nation ^[The Hebrew is plural, but the following verses refer to the nation as singular] from afar,
and he will whistle for it from the end of the earth.
And look! It comes quickly, swiftly!

###### v27
None _is_ weary,
and none among him stumbles;
none slumbers and none sleeps.
And no loincloth on his waist is opened,
and no thong of his sandals is drawn away.

###### v28
Whose arrows are sharp,
and all of his bows are bent.
The hoofs of his horses are reckoned like flint,
and his wheels like the storm wind.

###### v29
His roaring _is_ like the lion,
and he roars like young lions.
And he growls and seizes his prey,
and he carries _it_ off,
and not one can rescue _it_.

###### v30
And he will roar over him on that day
like _the_ roaring of _the_ sea,
and _if_ one looks to the land, look! Darkness! Distress!
And _the_ light grows dark with its ^[Presumably the land's] clouds.
