###### v1
In the year of the death of Uzziah the king, I saw the Lord sitting on a high and raised throne, and the hem of his robe _was_ filling the temple.

###### v2
Seraphs _were_ standing above him. _Each had six wings_: ^[Literally "six wings six wings for one"] with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.

###### v3
And the one called to the other and said,
"Holy, holy, holy _is_ Yahweh of hosts!
The _whole earth is full of his glory_." ^[Literally "fullness of all of the earth glory him"]

###### v4
And the pivots of the thresholds shook from the sound of those who called, and the house ^[Or "temple"] was filled _with_ smoke.

###### v5
And I said, "Woe to me! For I am destroyed! ^[Or "silenced"] For I _am_ a man _of unclean lips_, ^[Literally "unclean of lips"] and I _am_ living among ^[With an emphatic sense: "in the very heart and midst of"] a people _of unclean lips_, ^[Literally "unclean of lips"] for my eyes have seen the king, Yahweh of hosts!"

###### v6
Then one of the seraphs flew to me, and in his hand _was_ a hot coal he had taken from the altar with tongs.

###### v7
And he touched my mouth, and he said,
"Look! This has touched your lips
and has removed your guilt,
and your sin is annulled."

###### v8
Then I heard _the_ voice of the Lord saying,
"Whom shall I send?
And who will go for us?"
And I said,
"I _am_ here!
Send me!"

###### v9
And he said, "Go and say to this people,
'Keep on listening and do not comprehend!
And keep on looking and do not understand!'

###### v10
Make the heart of this people insensitive,
and make its ears unresponsive,
and shut its eyes
so that it may not look with its eyes
and listen with its ears
and comprehend _with_ its mind
and turn back, and it may be healed _for_ him."

###### v11
Then I said, "Until when, Lord?"
And he said,
"Until _the_ cities lie wasted without inhabitant,
and houses without people,
and the land is ruined _and_ a waste,

###### v12
and Yahweh sends the people far away,
and the abandonment is great in the midst of the land.

###### v13
And _even if only a tenth part remain_, ^[Literally "still in her a tenth"] _again she will be destroyed_ ^[Literally "and she will again and she will be to burn"]
like _a_ terebinth or like _an_ oak,
which although felled, a tree stump _remains_ in them.
_The_ seed of holiness _will be_ her tree stump."
