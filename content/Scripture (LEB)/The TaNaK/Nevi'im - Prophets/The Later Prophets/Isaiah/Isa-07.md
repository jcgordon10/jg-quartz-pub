###### v1
This happened in the days of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah. Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went ^[The Hebrew is singular] up _to_ Jerusalem for warfare against it, ^[Literally "her"] but he was not able to fight against it. ^[Literally "her"]

###### v2
When it was reported to the house of David, saying "Aram stands by Ephraim," his heart and the heart of his people shook like the shaking of the trees of _the_ forest because of _the_ wind.

###### v3
Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, "Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on _the_ highway of _the_ washer's field.

###### v4
And you must say to him, 'Take heed and be quiet! You must not fear, and your heart must not be faint because of these two stumps of smoldering firebrands, _because of the fierce anger of_ ^[Literally "because of the fierceness of the anger of"] Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah.

###### v5
Because Aram has plotted evil against you _with_ Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying,

###### v6
"Let us go up against Judah and let us tear her apart, _and let us lay it open and so bring it unto ourselves_, ^[Literally "and let us break through her to us"] and let us install the son of Tabeel _as_ king in her midst."

###### v7
Thus says the Lord Yahweh, "It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass.

###### v8
For the head of Aram _is_ Damascus, and the head of Damascus _is_ Rezin, and in sixty-five years from now Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.

###### v9
And the head of Ephraim _is_ Samaria, and the head of Samaria _is_ the son of Remaliah. If you do not believe then you will not endure."'"

###### v10
And Yahweh continued to speak to Ahaz, saying,

###### v11
"Ask for a sign for yourself from Yahweh God; make _it_ deep _as_ Sheol or make _it_ high as above."

###### v12
But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, and I will not put Yahweh to the test."

###### v13
Then he said, "Hear, house of David! _Is it_ too little for you to make men weary, that you should also make my God weary?

###### v14
Therefore the Lord himself will give you ^[The Hebrew is plural] a sign. Look! the virgin ^[Or "young woman"] _is_ with child and she is about to give birth _to_ a son, and she shall call his name 'God with us.'

###### v15
He shall eat curds and honey until he knows to reject the evil and to choose the good.

###### v16
For before the boy knows to reject the evil and to choose the good, _the land whose two kings you dread will be abandoned._ ^[Literally "the land which you dread will be abandoned because of the face of her two kings"]

###### v17
"Yahweh will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your ancestor ^[Or "father"] days that have not come since _the_ day Ephraim departed from Judah: the king of Assyria."

###### v18
And this shall happen: On that day, Yahweh will whistle for the fly that _is_ at the end of the stream of Egypt and the bee that _is_ in the land of Assyria.

###### v19
And all of them will come and settle in the rivers of the cliffs and in the clefts of the rocks and on all of the thornbushes and watering places.

###### v20
On that day, the Lord will shave the head and the hair of the feet with a razor of the one hired from beyond _the_ river--with the king of Assyria--and it will even take off the beard.

###### v21
And this shall happen: on that day, a young man will keep a young cow of _the_ herd and two sheep alive.

###### v22
And this shall happen: because of the abundance of milk production, he will eat curds, for every one that is left in the midst of the land will eat curds and honey.

###### v23
And this shall happen on that day: Every place where there are a thousand vines ^[Hebrew "vine"] for a thousand silver _pieces_ will become briers, ^[Hebrew "brier"] and it will be thornbushes. ^[Hebrew "thornbush"]

###### v24
One will go there with arrows and bow, for all of the land will be briers ^[Hebrew "brier"] and thornbushes. ^[Hebrew "thornbush"]

###### v25
And _as for_ all of the hills that they hoed with the hoe, you will not go there, _for_ fear of briers ^[Hebrew "brier"] and thornbushes. ^[Hebrew "thornbush"] And it will become like pastureland _for_ cattle and overtrodden land _for_ sheep.
