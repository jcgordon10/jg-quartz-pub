###### v1
Then Yahweh said to me, "Take yourself a large tablet and write on it with a common stylus pen: Maher-Halal-Hash-Baz.

###### v2
And I will require reliable witnesses as a witness for me: Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah."

###### v3
And I approached the prophetess, and she conceived, and she gave birth to a son. And Yahweh said to me, "Call his name Maher-Halal-Hash-Baz.

###### v4
For before the boy knows to call 'my father' and 'my mother,' _one_ will carry away the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria in the presence of the king of Assyria."

###### v5
And Yahweh continued to speak to me again, saying,

###### v6
"Because this people has refused the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices _over_ Rezin and the son of Remaliah,

###### v7
therefore look! The Lord _is_ bringing up the waters of the great and mighty river against them, the king of Assyria and all his glory.
And he will rise above all his channels,
and he will flow over all his banks.

###### v8
And he will sweep into Judah;
he will overflow and he will flood up to _the_ neck.
He will reach, and _he will spread his wings out over your entire land_, ^[Literally "the outspreading of his wings will be the fullness of the breadth of your land"] God with us."

###### v9
Be broken, _you_ peoples, and be dismayed.
And listen, all distant _parts of the_ earth;
gird yourselves and be dismayed;
gird yourselves and be dismayed!

###### v10
_Make a plan_, ^[Literally "Plan counsel"] but it will be frustrated!
Speak a word, but it will not stand,
for God is with us!

###### v11
For Yahweh said this to me _while his hand weighed heavily on me_, ^[Literally "with the strength of the hand"]
and he _warned me not to walk_ ^[Literally "instructed me from walking"] in the way of this people, saying,

###### v12
"You must not call conspiracy everything that this people calls conspiracy,
and you must not _share its fear_, ^[Literally "fear its fear"] and you must not be in dread.

###### v13
You shall regard Yahweh of hosts as holy,
and he _is_ your ^[The Hebrew is plural] fear, and he _is_ your dread.

###### v14
And he will become like a sanctuary and a stumbling-stone,
and like a stumbling-rock for the two houses of Israel,
like a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

###### v15
And many shall stumble among them,
and they shall fall and they shall be broken,
and they shall be ensnared and they shall be caught."

###### v16
Bind up _the_ testimony;
seal _the_ teaching among my disciples.

###### v17
And I will wait for Yahweh,
who hides his face from the house of Jacob,
and I will await him.

###### v18
Look! I and the children whom Yahweh has given to me _are_ like signs and portents in Israel from Yahweh of hosts, the one who dwells on the mountain of Zion.

###### v19
Now if they tell you, "Consult the ghosts and the spirits, those who chirp and those who mutter. Should not a people consult its gods, the dead on behalf of the living,

###### v20
for teaching and for testimony?" _surely they _who_ speak like this have no dawn_. ^[Literally "if not, they say like this word that there is no dawn for him," which could also mean "if not, let them say a word like this: that there is no dawn for him"]

###### v21
And it ^[That is, the nation] will pass through it ^[That is, the land] distressed and hungry, and this shall happen: when it is hungry, it will be enraged, and it will curse its king and its gods, ^[Or "God"] and it will face upwar

###### v22
or look to _the_ earth. But look! Distress and darkness, _the_ gloom of affliction! And _it will be_ thrust _into_ darkness!
