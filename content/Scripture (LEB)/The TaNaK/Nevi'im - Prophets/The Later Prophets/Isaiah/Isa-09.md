###### v1
 ^[[[Isa-09|Isaiah 9:1–21]] in the English Bible is 8:23–9:20 in the Hebrew Bible] _But there will be no gloom for those who were in distress_. ^[Literally "Indeed there is no gloom for the one to whom there was anxiety for her"]
In former times he ^[That is, Yahweh] treated _the_ land of Zebulun and Naphtali with contempt, but in the future he will honor the way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee _of_ the nations.

###### v2
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light;
light has shined on those who lived in a land of darkness.

###### v3
You have made the nation numerous;
you have not ^[The written text (_Kethib_) is "not," but the reading tradition (_Qere_) is "for it"] made the joy great.
They rejoice in your presence as _with_ joy at the harvest,
as they rejoice when they divide plunder.

###### v4
For you have shattered the yoke of its burden
and the stick of its shoulder,
the rod of its oppressor, on ^[Hebrew "like"; the Hebrew letters for "like" and "on" look alike] the day of Midian.

###### v5
For every boot _that marches and shakes the earth_ ^[Literally "marching with shaking," which might mean "marching _is_ with shaking"]
and garment rolled in blood
_will_ ^[Literally "and it will"] be for burning--fire fuel.

###### v6
For a child has been born for us;
a son has been given to us.
And the dominion will be on his shoulder,
and his name is called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

###### v7
_His dominion will grow continually,_
_and to peace there will be no end_ ^[Literally "There is no end to the increase of the dominion and to peace"]
on ^[Or "for"] the throne of David and over ^[Or "for"] his kingdom,
to establish it ^[That is, the kingdom] and sustain it
with justice and righteousness
now and forever.
The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this.

###### v8
The Lord has sent out a word against Jacob,
and it fell on Israel.

###### v9
And all of the people knew it,
Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria
in pride and arrogance of heart, saying,

###### v10
"_The_ bricks have fallen, but we will build _with_ dressed stone.
_The_ sycamore-fig trees were felled, but we will replace _them with_ cedars."

###### v11
So Yahweh strengthened _the adversaries of Rezin_ ^[Or "his adversaries" if a copyist added "of Rezin" in error] against him,
and he provoked his enemies--

###### v12
Aram from _the_ east
and Philistines ^[Hebrew "Philistine"] from _the_ west--
and they devoured Israel with the whole mouth.
He has not turned away his anger in all of this,
and his hand is still stretched out.

###### v13
And the people did not turn to the one who struck it, ^[That is, the people]
and they did not seek Yahweh of hosts.

###### v14
So Yahweh cut off head and tail from Israel,
palm branch and reed _in_ one day.

###### v15
Elders ^[Hebrew "Elder"] and _the respectable_ ^[Literally "one lifted up of face"] _are_ the head,
and prophets ^[Hebrew "prophet"] who teach lies ^[Hebrew "lie"] _are_ the tail.

###### v16
And the leaders of this people were misleading _them_,
and those who were led _were_ confused.

###### v17
Therefore the Lord did not rejoice over its young men,
and he did not have compassion on its orphans and widows,
for everyone _was_ godless and an evildoer,
and every mouth _was_ speaking folly.
In all of this his anger did not turn away,
and still his hand _is_ stretched out.

###### v18
For wickedness burned like fire;
it consumed brier and thorn.
And it kindled the thickets of the forest,
and they swirled upward _in_ a column of smoke.

###### v19
The land was burned through the wrath of Yahweh of hosts,
and the people became like fire fuel.
_People had no compassion toward each other_. ^[Literally "A man does not have compassion toward his brother"]

###### v20
They devoured on _the_ right but _still_ were hungry
and devoured on _the_ left but they were not satisfied.
Each one devoured the flesh of his arm,

###### v21
    Manasseh _devoured_ Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh;
together they _were_ against Judah.
In all of this his anger has not turned away,
and still his hand _is_ stretched out.
