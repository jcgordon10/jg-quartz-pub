[[Isa-09|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-11|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Ah! Those who decree decrees of evil,
and writers who have written harm,

###### v2
to guide _the_ needy away from legal claims, ^[Hebrew "claim"]
and to rob the justice from the poor of my people,
to make widows their spoil;
and they plunder orphans.

###### v3
And what will you do at _the_ day of punishment,
and at calamity? It comes from afar!
To whom will you flee for help,
and where will you leave your wealth,

###### v4
_save that they bow down under the prisoners_
_and fall under the slain_? ^[Literally "except he will bow down under a prisoner and under slain they will fall"; "under" could also mean "in the place of"]
In all of this his anger has not turned away,
and still his hand _is_ stretched out.

###### v5
Ah! Assyria, the rod of my anger,
and a staff is in their hand: my wrath!

###### v6
I send him against a godless nation,
and I command him against the people of my wrath,
to capture spoil
and to carry off plunder,
and to make them ^[Hebrew "him"] a trampling place,
like _the_ clay of _the_ streets.

###### v7
But he does not think this, ^[Or "so"]
and his heart does not plan this.
For _it is_ in his heart to destroy
and to cut off not a few nations.

###### v8
For he says, "_Are_ not my commanders altogether kings?

###### v9
    _Is_ not Calno like Carchemish?
_Is_ not Hamath like Arpad?
_Is_ not Samaria like Damascus?

###### v10
As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols ^[Hebrew "idol"]
--and their images were _greater than those of_ ^[Literally "from"] Jerusalem and Samaria--

###### v11
shall I not do to Jerusalem and its idols
what I have done to Samaria and her idols?"

###### v12
And this shall happen: when the Lord has finished all his work against _Mount Zion_ ^[Literally "the mountain of Zion"] and Jerusalem, "I will punish the _arrogance_ ^[Literally "fruit of the greatness of the heart"] of the king of Assyria and _his haughtiness_." ^[Literally "the pride of the height of his eyes"]

###### v13
For he says,
"I have done _it_ by the strength of my hand
and by my wisdom, for I have understanding,
and I have removed _the_ boundaries of peoples,
and I have plundered their stores,
and like a bull I have brought down _the inhabitants_. ^[Or, "those sitting," that is, rulers sitting on thrones]

###### v14
And my hand has found, like _a_ nest, the wealth of the peoples,
and like the gathering of forsaken eggs, I myself have gathered all the earth.
And _there_ was no fluttering wing or open mouth or chirp."

###### v15
Does the ax boast against the one who cuts with it,
or the saw magnify itself against _the_ one who moves it to and fro?
_As if a rod should move the one who lifts it_! ^[Literally "As a rod waving even the one who lifts it up"]
_As if a staff should lift up that which is not wood_! ^[Literally "As a staff lifting up not wood"]

###### v16
Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, will send leanness among his sturdy warriors,
and a burning like _the_ burning of fire will burn under his glory.

###### v17
And the light of Israel will become like a fire,
and his holy one like a flame,
and it will burn and devour his thorns ^[Hebrew "thorn"] and briers ^[Hebrew "brier"] in one day.

###### v18
And he will destroy the glory of his forest and orchard _completely_, ^[Literally "from soul and to body"]
and it will be like the wasting away of one who is sick.

###### v19
And the rest of the trees ^[Hebrew "tree"] of his forest will be a small number,
and a boy can write them _down_.

###### v20
And this shall happen: on that day, the remnant of Israel and the survivors ^[Hebrew "survivor"] of the house of Jacob will not continue to lean on _the_ one who struck it
but will lean on Yahweh, the holy one of Israel, in truth.

###### v21
A remnant will return--
the remnant of Jacob--to _the_ mighty God.

###### v22
For though your people Israel was like the sand of the sea,
_only_ a remnant of it will return.
Annihilation _is_ determined,
overflowing _with_ righteousness.

###### v23
For the Lord Yahweh of hosts _is_ about to make a complete destruction
and a determined end in the midst of all the earth.

###### v24
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh of hosts:
"My people who live _in_ Zion,
you must not be afraid of Assyria.
It beats you with the rod,
and it lifts up its staff against you _as the Egyptians did_. ^[Literally "in the way of Egypt"]

###### v25
_My_ indignation will come to an end _in just a very little while_, ^[Literally "for still a little a trifle"]
and my anger _will be_ directed to their destruction."

###### v26
And Yahweh of hosts is going to swing a whip against him,
as when Midian was defeated at the rock of Oreb;
and his staff _will be_ over the sea,
and he will lift him up _as he did in Egypt_. ^[Literally "in the way of Egypt"]

###### v27
And this shall happen: on that day,
he will remove his burden from your shoulder
and his yoke from your neck,
_and a yoke will be destroyed because of fat_. ^[The meaning of this phrase is uncertain, leading to the conjecture that it belongs with the next verse and by a different word division could mean "he has gone up from Jeshimon"; alternatively, "fat" could be a metaphor for prosperity]

###### v28
He has come to Aiath,
he has passed through Migron;
at Micmash he deposited his baggage.

###### v29
They crossed over _the_ pass;
Geba _is_ a place of overnight lodging for us.
Ramah trembles;
Gibeah of Saul has fled.

###### v30
Daughter of Gallim, cry out _with_ your voice;
Laishah, listen!
_Anathoth is poor_. ^[Or with different vocalization, "Answer her, Anathoth!" which fits the parallelism better]

###### v31
Madmenah flees!
The inhabitants of Gebim bring themselves into safety!

###### v32
_This day_ ^[Literally "Yet today"] _taking a stand_ ^[Literally "to stand"] at Nob,
he will shake his fist _at_ the mountain of the daughter ^[Following the reading tradition (_Qere_); the consonantal text has "house"] of Zion,
_at_ the hill of Jerusalem.

###### v33
Look! The Lord Yahweh of hosts is about to lop off _the_ branches ^[Hebrew "branch"] with great power,
and _the towering trees_ ^[Literally "the haughty of the height"] will be felled,
and the _tall trees_ ^[Literally "height"] will be brought low.

###### v34
And he will cut down the thickets of the forest with the axe,
and Lebanon will fall by _the_ mighty _one_.
