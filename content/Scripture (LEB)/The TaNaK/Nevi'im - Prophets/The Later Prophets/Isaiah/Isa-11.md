[[Isa-10|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-12|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
And a shoot will come out from the stump of Jesse,
and a branch from its roots will bear fruit.

###### v2
And the spirit of Yahweh shall rest on him--
a spirit of wisdom and understanding,
a spirit of counsel and might,
a spirit of knowledge and the fear of Yahweh.

###### v3
    And his _breath_ ^[Hebrew "smelling," perhaps metaphorically as "delight" as in [[Amos-05#v14|Amos 5:14;]] perhaps this line was accidentally copied twice from the preceding line] _is_ in the fear of Yahweh.
And he shall judge not by his eyesight,
and he shall rebuke not by _what he hears with_ ^[Literally "the rumors of"] his ears.

###### v4
But he shall judge _the_ poor with righteousness,
and he shall decide for _the_ needy of _the_ earth with rectitude.
And he shall strike _the_ earth with the rod of his mouth,
and he shall kill _the_ wicked person with the breath of his lips.

###### v5
And righteousness shall be the belt around his waist,
and faithfulness the belt around his loins.

###### v6
And a wolf shall _stay_ ^[Literally "dwell as an alien"] with a lamb,
and a leopard shall lie down with a kid,
and a calf and a lion and a fatling together
_as a small boy leads_ ^[Literally "and a small boy leading"] them.

###### v7
And a cow and a bear shall graze;
their young shall lie down together.
And a lion shall eat straw like the cattle.

###### v8
And _an infant_ ^[Literally "one nursing"] shall play over a serpent's hole,
and _a toddler_ ^[Literally "one who is weaned"] shall put his hand on a viper's hole.

###### v9
They will not injure and they will not destroy on all of my _holy mountain_, ^[Literally "mountain of holiness"]
for the earth will be full _of the_ knowledge _of_ Yahweh,
as the waters cover the sea.

###### v10
And this shall happen on that day:
_the_ nations shall inquire of the root of Jesse,
which shall be standing as a signal to _the_ peoples,
and his resting place shall be glorious.

###### v11
And this shall happen on that day:
The Lord will again _extend_ his hand a second _time_
to acquire the remnant of his people that is left,
from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the coastlands of the sea,

###### v12
and he will raise a signal for the nations.
And he will gather the outcasts of Israel,
and he will gather the scattered ones of Judah together from the four _corners_ ^[Literally "wings"] of the earth.

###### v13
And the jealousy of Ephraim shall depart,
and the enemies of Judah shall be cut off.
Ephraim shall not be jealous _of_ Judah,
and Judah shall not be an enemy _of_ Ephraim.

###### v14
But they shall _swoop_ ^[Literally "fly"] upon _the_ Philistine shoulder, ^[That is, the hill country west of Judah] _westward_. ^[Literally "sea"]
Together they shall plunder _the_ sons of _the_ east.
Edom and Moab _will be under their command_, ^[Literally "the stretching of their hand"]
and the sons of Ammon _will be_ their subjugated people.

###### v15
And Yahweh will divide ^[Or "utterly destroy"] the tongue ^[Probably the "gulf"] of the sea of Egypt, ^[That is, the Red Sea]
and he will wave his hand over the river ^[That is, the Euphrates River] with his scorching wind;
and he will strike it into seven streams,
and he will _make it passable by foot_. ^[Literally "cause to walk with the sandal"]

###### v16
So there shall be a highway from Assyria for the remnant of his people that remains,
as there was for Israel _when_ ^[Literally "in _the_ day"] it went up from the land of Egypt.
