###### v1
The oracle of Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:

###### v2
Raise a signal on a bare hill,
lift up _your_ voice to them;
wave _the_ hand and may they enter _the_ gateways of _the_ noblemen.

###### v3
I myself I have commanded my consecrated ones,
I have also summoned my mighty warriors concerning my anger,
the _ones who exalt over_ ^[Literally "exultant of"] my majesty.

###### v4
A sound, a noise _is_ on the mountains,
_the_ likeness _of_ many people!
A sound of _the_ roar of _the_ kingdoms,
of nations gathering!
Yahweh of hosts _is_ mustering an army for battle.

###### v5
_They are_ coming from a distant land,
from the end of the heavens,
Yahweh and the weapons of his indignation,
to destroy _the whole earth_. ^[Literally "all of the land/earth"]

###### v6
Wail, for the day of Yahweh _is_ near;
it will come like destruction from Shaddai! ^[Often translated "the Almighty"]

###### v7
Therefore all hands will grow slack,
and every human heart will melt,

###### v8
    and they will be dismayed.
Pangs and labor pains will seize _them_;
they will tremble like a woman giving birth.
_They will stare at one another_, ^[Literally "A man will stare at his neighbor"]
_their faces flushing_. ^[Literally "faces of flames"]

###### v9
Look! The day of Yahweh _is_ coming,
cruel and wrath and _the_ burning _of_ anger,
to make the earth a desolation,
and he will destroy its sinners from it.

###### v10
For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not flash forth their light;
the sun will keep back when it comes out,
and _the_ moon will not cause its light to shine.

###### v11
And I will punish _the_ world _for its_ evil
and _the_ wicked _for_ their iniquity.
And I will put an end to _the_ pride of _the_ arrogant,
and I will bring _the_ haughtiness of tyrants low.

###### v12
I will make humanity more rare than gold
and humankind more than the gold of Ophir.

###### v13
Therefore I will make _the_ heavens tremble,
and the earth will quake from its place
because of the wrath of Yahweh of hosts,
and in the day his anger burns.

###### v14
And this shall happen:
like a hunted gazelle or sheep _with none to gather them_, ^[Literally "and without one who gathers"]
they will each turn to his _own_ people,
and they will each flee to his _own_ land.

###### v15
Everyone who is found will be pierced through,
and everyone who is carried away will fall by the sword.

###### v16
And their children will be dashed into pieces before their eyes;
their houses will be plundered, and their wives will be raped. ^[The reading tradition (_Qere_) softens this to "slept with"]

###### v17
Look! I _am_ stirring the Medes up against them,
who do not value silver
and do not delight in gold.

###### v18
And _their_ bows will shatter young men.
And they will not show mercy on _the_ fruit of _the_ womb;
their eyes will not look compassionately on children.

###### v19
And Babylon, _the_ glory of kingdoms, the splendor of the Chaldeans' pride, will be like _when God overthrew_ ^[Literally "the overthrow by God of"] Sodom and Gomorrah.

###### v20
It will not be inhabited forever,
and it will not be dwelled in _forever_; ^[Literally "until generation and generation"]
and no Arab will pitch a tent there,
and shepherds will not allow _their flocks_ to lie down there.

###### v21
But wild animals will lie down there,
and their houses will be full _of_ howling creatures,
and the daughters of ostriches ^[Hebrew "ostrich"] will live there,
and goats will dance there.

###### v22
And hyenas will answer in its palaces,
and jackals in the pleasure palaces;
and its time _is coming soon_, ^[Literally "close to come"]
and its days will not be prolonged.
