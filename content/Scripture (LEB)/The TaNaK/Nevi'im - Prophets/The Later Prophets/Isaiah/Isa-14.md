###### v1
But Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob,
and he will again choose Israel
and set them on their land,
and the immigrant will join himself to them,
and they will attach themselves to the house of Jacob.

###### v2
And _the_ nations will take them
and bring them to their place,
and the house of Israel will take possession of them ^[That is, the nations] in the land of Yahweh
as slaves and female slaves.
And this will happen:
they will take their captors captive
and rule over their oppressors.

###### v3
And it shall happen on the day Yahweh gives you rest from your pain and turmoil and hard labor which _you had to perform_, ^[Literally "was worked by you"]

###### v4
that you will take this taunt against the king of Babylon,
and you will say:
"How _the_ oppressor has ceased!
_his_ insolence ^[The meaning of the word is uncertain; others translate it as "fury," "hostility," or even "golden city"] has ceased.

###### v5
Yahweh has broken _the_ staff of _the_ wicked,
_the_ scepter of rulers,

###### v6
that struck _the_ peoples in wrath, a blow without ceasing,
that ruled _the_ nations in anger
_with unrestrained persecution_. ^[Literally "persecution without withholding"]

###### v7
All of the earth rests _and_ is quiet;
they break forth _into_ singing.

###### v8
Even _the_ cypresses rejoice over you,
the cedars of Lebanon:
'Since you were laid down,
no _wood_ cutter comes up against us.'

###### v9
Sheol below is getting excited over you,
to meet _you when you come_; ^[Literally "your entrance"]
it arouses _the_ dead spirits for you,
all of _the_ leaders of _the_ earth.
It raises all of _the_ kings of _the_ nations from their thrones.

###### v10
All of them will respond and say to you,
'You yourself also were made weak like us!
You have become the same as us!'

###### v11
Your pride is brought down _to_ Sheol,
_and_ the sound of your harps;
maggots ^[Hebrew "maggot"] are spread out beneath you like a bed,
and your covering is worms. ^[Hebrew "worm"]

###### v12
How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of dawn!
You are cut down to the ground, conqueror of nations!

###### v13
And you yourself said in your heart,
'I will ascend _to_ heaven;
I will raise up my throne above the stars of God;
and I will sit on _the_ mountain of assembly
on the summit of Zaphon; ^[Or "of the north"]

###### v14
I will ascend to _the_ high places of _the_ clouds, ^[Hebrew "cloud"]
I will make myself like the Most High.'

###### v15
But you are brought down to Sheol,
to _the_ depths of _the_ pit.

###### v16
Those who see you will stare at you,
they will look closely at you:
'_Is_ this the man who made the earth tremble,
who caused kingdoms to shake,

###### v17
who made _the_ world like the desert
and destroyed its cities,
_who_ would not let his prisoners go home?'

###### v18
All _the_ kings of _the_ nations, all of them, lie in glory,
each one in his house.

###### v19
But _as for_ you, you are thrown away from your grave,
like an abhorrent shoot,
clothed with _the_ slain,
those pierced _by the_ sword,
those who go down to _the_ stones of _the_ pit,
like a corpse that is trodden down.

###### v20
You will not be united with them in burial
because you have destroyed your land,
you have killed your people.
_The_ descendants ^[Hebrew "descendant"] of evildoers will not be mentioned for eternity!

###### v21
Prepare a place of slaughter for his sons
because of the sin of their ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]
Let them not rise and take possession of _the_ earth
or fill up _the_ face of _the_ world _with_ cities."

###### v22
"And I will rise up against them,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts,
"and I will cut off name and a remnant from Babylon,
and offspring and posterity,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v23
"And I will make her a possession of _the_ hedgehog,
and pools of water,
and I will sweep her away with _the_ broom of destruction,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts.

###### v24
Yahweh of hosts has sworn, saying,
"_Surely_ ^[The oath formula begins literally "If not"] just as I have intended, so it shall be.
And just as I have planned, it shall stand:

###### v25
to break Assyria in my land,
and I will trample him down on my mountains;
and he shall remove his yoke from them,
and he shall remove his burden from his ^[That is, their] shoulders." ^[Hebrew "shoulder"]

###### v26
This _is_ the plan that is planned concerning all of the earth;
and this _is_ the hand that is stretched out over all of the nations.

###### v27
For Yahweh of hosts has planned, and who will frustrate _it_?
And his hand _is_ stretched out, and who will turn it back?

###### v28
In the year of the death of king Ahaz there was this oracle:

###### v29
You must not rejoice, all you Philistines,
that the rod that struck you is broken,
for a viper will come forth from _the_ root of _the_ snake,
and its fruit _will be_ a flying serpent.

###### v30
And _the_ firstborn of _the_ poor will graze,
and _the_ needy will lie down in security;
but I will cause your root to die in famine,
and it will kill your remnant.

###### v31
Wail, gate! Cry, city!
Melt, ^[With fear or despair] Philistia, all of you!
For smoke _is_ coming from _the_ north,
and there is no straggler in his ranks.

###### v32
And what will one answer _the_ messengers of _the_ nation?
That Yahweh has founded Zion,
and the needy of his people will take refuge in it.
