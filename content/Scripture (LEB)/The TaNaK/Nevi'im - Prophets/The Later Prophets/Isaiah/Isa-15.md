###### v1
An oracle of Moab:
Because Ar is devastated in a night, Moab is destroyed;
because Kir of Moab is devastated in a night, it is destroyed.

###### v2
It has gone up _to_ the house, ^[Or "temple"]
and Dibon _to_ the high places
for weeping over Nebo,
and Moab wails over Medeba.
_Every head is bald_, ^[Literally "On all its heads baldness"]
every beard _is_ shaved.

###### v3
They gird themselves _with_ sackcloth in its streets;
on its roofs and public squares everyone wails,
going down in weeping.

###### v4
And Heshbon and Elealeh cry ^[The Hebrew is singular] out,
their voice is heard as far as Jahaz;
therefore the armed ones of Moab cry out;
its soul quivers ^[The Hebrew words for "cry out" and "quiver" are similar] for him.

###### v5
My heart cries out for Moab;
its fugitives _flee_ up to Zoar,
to Eglath-shelishiyah.
For _at_ the ascent of Luhith it goes up it with weeping;
for _on_ the road of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction.

###### v6
For the waters of Nimrim are wastelands;
for _the_ grass has withered,
_the_ vegetation has vanished,
_there is_ no greenness.

###### v7
Therefore they carry _the_ abundance it has made
and their store of goods over the river of the poplars.

###### v8
For _a_ cry for help has encircled the territory of Moab,
her wailing _is heard_ as far as Eglaim,
and her wailing _as far as_ Beer Elim.

###### v9
For the waters of Dimon ^[One of the Dead Sea Scrolls reads "Dibon" here] are full _of_ blood;
but I will place added things upon Dimon:
a lion for the survivors ^[Hebrew "survivor"] of Moab
and for _the_ remnant of _the_ land.
