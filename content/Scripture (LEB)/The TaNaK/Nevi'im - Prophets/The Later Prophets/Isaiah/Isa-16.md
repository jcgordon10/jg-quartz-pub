[[Isa-15|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-17|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Send a ram ^[Possibly "rams" if a scribe accidentally omitted the Hebrew plural ending because the next word begins with that same letter] _to the_ ruler _of the_ land,
from Sela _across the_ desert to the mountain of _daughter Zion_. ^[Literally "the daughter of Zion"]

###### v2
And this shall be:
like a bird fleeing _from_ a thrust away nest
shall be the daughters of Moab _at the_ fords of Arnon.

###### v3
"Bring counsel,
make a decision;
make your shade like the night
in the middle of noonday.
Hide _the_ outcasts;
you must not betray the fugitive.

###### v4
Let my outcasts _of_ Moab dwell as aliens among you;
be a hiding place for them from _the_ presence of _the_ destroyer."
When the oppressor is no more, destruction has stopped,
_the_ _one who tramples has_ ^[Literally "one who tramples have," with mismatched singular and plural] disappeared from the land,

###### v5
then a throne shall be established in steadfast love,
and one shall sit on it in faithfulness, in the tent of David,
judging and seeking justice
and zealous for righteousness.

###### v6
We have heard _of_ the pride of Moab--exceedingly proud--
_of_ his arrogance, pride, and insolence; _his boasting is not true_. ^[Literally "not so his boasting"]

###### v7
Therefore Moab wails;
all of it wails for Moab,
for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth you moan, _utterly devastated_. ^[Literally "surely destroyed"]

###### v8
For Heshbon withers the fields, the vine of Sibmah;
rulers of nations have broken down her tendrils,
they reached up to Jazer,
they wandered _to the_ desert;
her shoots spread abroad,
they crossed over _the_ sea.

###### v9
Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer _for_ the vine of Sibmah.
I drench you _with_ my tears, ^[Hebrew "tear"] Heshbon and Elealeh,
for a jubilant shout has fallen over your summer fruit and harvest.

###### v10
And joy and gladness are ^[The Hebrew is singular] taken away from the fruitful land,
and in the vineyards no one exults,
no one shouts for joy;
no treader treads wine in the presses;
I have put to an end to _the_ jubilant shout.

###### v11
Therefore my _heart moans_ ^[Literally "intestines moan,"; in Hebrew, the "intestines" are the seat of the emotions, which would correspond to the "heart" in English] like _a_ harp for Moab
and my inner parts for Kir-heres.

###### v12
And this shall happen:
when Moab appears, when it is weary upon the high place
and it comes to its sanctuary to pray, it will not prevail.

###### v13
This _was_ the word that Yahweh spoke to Moab _in the past_. ^[Literally "from then"]

###### v14
But now Yahweh speaks, saying, "In three years, like _the_ years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will become contemptible, with all of the great multitude, and _the_ remnant _will be_ a few, small, not strong.
