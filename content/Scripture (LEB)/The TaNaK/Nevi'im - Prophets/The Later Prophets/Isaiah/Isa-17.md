###### v1
An oracle of Damascus:
"Look! Damascus _will_ cease being a city
and will become a heap of ruins.

###### v2
The cities of Aroer will be deserted; ^[These words in Hebrew (and "flocks" in the next line) all begin with the same letter, Ayin]
they will be for the flocks,
and they will lie down and _no one will frighten_ ^[Literally "there is not one who frightens"] _them_.

###### v3
And _the_ fortified city will disappear from Ephraim,
and _the_ kingdom from Damascus;
and the remnant of Aram will be like the glory of the children of Israel,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts.

###### v4
"And this shall happen:
On that day, the glory of Jacob will be brought low,
and the fat of his flesh will become lean.

###### v5
And it shall be as _when a reaper gathers_ ^[Literally "a gathering of a reaper of"] standing grain
and he reaps grain _with_ his arm,
and it shall be like one who gathers ears of grain
in the valley of Rephaim.

###### v6
And gleanings will be left over in it, as _when an olive tree is beaten_, ^[Literally "beating of an olive tree"]
two _or_ three ripe olive berries in _the_ top of a branch,
four _or_ five on its fruitful branches,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh, the God of Israel.

###### v7
On that day, mankind will look to its maker,
and its eyes will look to the holy one of Israel;

###### v8
it will not look to the altars,
the work of its hands,
and it will not see what its fingers made
and the poles of Asherah worship and the incense altars.

###### v9
On that day, _its fortified cities_ ^[Literally "the cities of his fortress"] will be like the _abandonment of the wooded place and the summit_, ^[Perhaps this difficult phrase originally read "abandonment of the wooded heights of the Amorites"] which they deserted because of the children of Israel; and there will be desolation.

###### v10
For you have forgotten the God of your salvation,
and you have not remembered the rock of your refuge;
therefore you plant plants of pleasantness,
and you _plant_ ^[Literally "plant it"] a vine of a foreigner.

###### v11
On your planting day you make _them_ grow,
and in the morning _of_ your sowing you bring _them_ into bloom,
_yet_ the harvest will flee ^[Reading the same consonants as a verb, _nad_, rather than the noun _ned,_ which would mean "a heap _of__the_ harvest"] in a day _of_ sickness and incurable pain.

###### v12
Ah! _The_ noise of many peoples, they make a noise like _the_ noise of _the_ seas!
And _the_ roar of nations, they roar like _the_ roar of mighty waters!

###### v13
_The_ nations roar like _the_ roar of many waters,
but he will rebuke him, and he will flee far away.
And they are chased like chaff of _the_ mountains before _the_ wind
and like tumbleweed before _the_ storm.

###### v14
At _the_ time of evening, and look, terror!
Before morning he is no more.
This _is_ the fate of those who plunder us
and _the_ lot of those who plunder us.
