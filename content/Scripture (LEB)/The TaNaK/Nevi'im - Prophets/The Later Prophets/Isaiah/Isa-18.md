###### v1
Ah! land _of the_ whirring of wings,
which _is_ beyond the rivers of Cush,

###### v2
that sends messengers by the sea
and in vessels of papyrus on _the_ surface of _the_ waters!
Go, swift messengers, to a _tall_ ^[Literally "stretched out"] and _smooth_ ^[Literally "peeled," "wiped clean," or "hairless"] nation,
to a people feared _near and far_, ^[Literally "from this and beyond"]
a _mighty, mighty_ ^[Perhaps this is a gibberish phrase in Hebrew, _qaw-qaw_] and trampling ^[Meaning uncertain] nation,
whose land rivers divide.

###### v3
All _you_ inhabitants of _the_ world
and dwellers of _the_ earth,
_when a signal is raised on the_ ^[Literally "as a raising of a signal"] mountains, you must look,
and _when a trumpet is blown_, ^[Literally "as a blowing of a trumpet"] you must listen!

###### v4
For Yahweh said this to me:
"I will be quiet,
and I will look from my dwelling place
like _clear heat because of light_, ^[The meaning of this phrase is uncertain; perhaps the "light" is sunlight]
like a cloud of dew in _the_ heat of harvest."

###### v5
For before _the_ harvest, _when the blossom is complete_ ^[Literally "as a completion of a blossom"]
and a blossom becomes ripening fruit,
and one cuts off the shoots with pruning hooks,
and one removes, tears away the tendrils.

###### v6
They shall _all be left_ ^[Literally "be left together"] for birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of prey of _the_ mountains
and for the animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] of the earth.
And the birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of prey will pass the summer on it,
and every animal of the earth will winter on it.

###### v7
At that time, a gift ^[Perhaps tribute is meant] will be brought to Yahweh of hosts
_from_ a _tall_ ^[Literally "stretched out"] and _smooth_ ^[Literally "peeled," "wiped clean," or "hairless"] people,
and from a people feared near and far,
a mighty, mighty and trampling nation,
whose land _the_ rivers divide,
to the place of the name of Yahweh of hosts,
the mountain of Zion.
