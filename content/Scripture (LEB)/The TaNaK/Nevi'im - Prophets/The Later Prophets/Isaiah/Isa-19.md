An oracle of Egypt:
Look! Yahweh _is_ riding on a swift cloud
and _is_ coming _to_ Egypt.
And the idols of Egypt will tremble in front of him,
and the heart of Egypt melts in his inner parts.

###### v2
"And I will stir up _Egyptians_ ^[Literally "Egypt"] against _Egyptians_, ^[Literally "Egypt"]
and each one will fight against his brother
and each one against his neighbor,

###### v3
And the spirit of _the Egyptians_ ^[Literally "Egypt"] will be disturbed in his midst,
and I will _confuse_ ^[Literally "engulf"] his plans, ^[Hebrew "plan"]
and they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead,
and the ghosts and the spiritists.

###### v4
And I will hand over _the Egyptians_ ^[Literally "Egypt"] into _the_ hand of a hard master,
and a powerful king will rule over them,"

And _the_ waters will be dried up from the sea,
and _the_ river will be parched and dry.

the branches of the Nile of Egypt will become little and dry up;
reed and rush will wither.

###### v7

it will be driven about, and _it will be no more_. ^[Literally "there is none of it"]

###### v8
And the fishers will mourn,

and those who spread out fishing nets ^[Hebrew "net"] on _the_ _surface_ ^[Literally "face"] of _the_ water will languish.

all _the_ _hired workers_ ^[Literally "workers of wage"] _will be_ grieved of heart.

###### v11
Surely the princes of Zoan _are_ foolish;
the wise of the counselors of Pharaoh _give_ senseless counsel.
How can you say to Pharaoh,
"I myself _am_ a son of sages,
a _descendant_ ^[Literally "son"] of ancient kings"?

###### v12
Where _are_ your sages then?
Now, let them tell you,
and let them know what Yahweh of hosts has planned against Egypt.

###### v13
The princes of Zoan have become foolish;
the princes of Memphis are deceived;
the leaders of her tribes have led Egypt astray.

Yahweh has mixed a spirit of confusion into her midst,
and they have caused Egypt to stagger in all of its doings,
as _when a drunkard staggers_ ^[Literally "the staggering of a drunkard"] in his vomit.

And _there will be nothing for Egypt to do_, ^[Literally "not it will be for Egypt a deed which he can do"]
head or tail, palm branch or reed.

And it will be a sign and a witness to Yahweh of hosts in the land of Egypt; when they cry out to Yahweh because of oppressors, he will send them a savior and a _defender_, ^[Literally "contender"] and he will deliver them.

###### v21
And Yahweh will make himself known to Egypt, and Egypt will know Yahweh on that day, and they will worship _with_ sacrifice and offering, and they will make vows ^[Hebrew "vow"] to Yahweh, and they will fulfill _them_.
