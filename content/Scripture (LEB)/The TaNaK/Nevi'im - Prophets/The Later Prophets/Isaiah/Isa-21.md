###### v1
The oracle of _the_ wilderness of _the_ sea:
As storm winds passing over in the Negev,
_it comes_ ^[Literally "to come"] from _the_ desert,
from a frightful land.

###### v2
A hard revelation is told to me;
the treacherous deals treacherously,
and the destroyer destroys.
Go up, Elam;
lay siege, Media!
I put an end to all of her sighing.

###### v3
Therefore my loins are filled _with_ anguish;
pangs have seized me, like _the_ pangs of a woman giving birth.
I am _too bent to hear_, ^[Literally "bent from hearing," which could also mean "bent because of what I heard"]
I am _too dismayed to see_. ^[Literally "dismayed from seeing," which could also mean "dismayed because of what I saw"]

###### v4
My _mind_ ^[Literally "heart"] staggers; fear terrifies me;
the twilight _I desired_ ^[Literally "of my desire"] _brought_ ^[Literally "put"] me fear.

###### v5
Set out the table in order!
Spread out the rugs! ^[Hebrew "rug"]
Eat! drink!
Rise up, commanders;
smear ^[That is, prepare with oil] _the_ shield!

###### v6
For the Lord said this to me:
"Go, set _a_ watchman in position.
He must announce what he sees.

###### v7
When ^[Or "And"] he sees riders, ^[Hebrew "rider"]
a pair of horsemen,
riders ^[Hebrew "rider"] of donkeys, ^[Hebrew "donkey"]
riders ^[Hebrew "rider"] of camels, ^[Hebrew "camel"]
_then_ ^[Or "and"] he must listen attentively,
paying attention, paying _special_ ^[Literally "much"] attention."

###### v8
Then ^[Or "And"] _the_ _watchman_ ^[Literally "lion"] called,
"Lord, I _am_ standing on _the_ watchtower continually by day,
and I _am_ standing at my post _throughout_ ^[Literally "all of"] the night.

###### v9
And look _at_ this! A man's a chariot _is_ coming,
a pair of horsemen!"
Then ^[Or "and"] he responded and said,
"It has fallen! Babylon has fallen!
And all the images of her gods are ^[Hebrew "is"] smashed on the ground!"

###### v10
My downtrodden people
and the son of my threshing floor,
I will announce to you what I have heard from Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel.

###### v11
The oracle of Dumah:
_One is_ calling to me from Seir,
"Watchman, what _of_ ^[Literally "from"] _the_ night?
Watchman, what _of_ ^[Literally "from"] _the_ night?"

###### v12
_The_ watchman says,
"Morning comes,
and also _the_ night.
If you will inquire, inquire;
_come back again_." ^[Literally "return come"]

###### v13
An oracle _concerning_ ^[Literally "in"] Arabia:
You will spend the night in the thicket in a desert-plateau, ^[The Hebrew for "in a desert-plateau" is the same as for "concerning Arabia" in the preceding line]
caravans of Dedanites.

###### v14
_When you happen to meet_ ^[Literally "Toward encountering"] _the_ thirsty, bring water.
Inhabitants of the land of Tema came to meet _the_ fugitive with his bread.

###### v15
For they have fled from _the_ swords,
from _the_ drawn sword and _the_ bent bow,
and from _the_ heaviness of _the_ battle.

###### v16
For the Lord said this to me:
"_In one more year_, ^[Literally "In yet a year"] like _the_ years of a hired worker,
all the glory of Kedar will come to an end.

###### v17
    And the remainder of the number of the bows ^[Hebrew "bow"] of the warriors of the sons of Kedar will be few."
For Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken.
