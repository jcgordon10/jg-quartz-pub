###### v1
_The_ oracle of _the_ valley of vision:
_What business do you have going_ ^[Literally "What to you then that you have gone"] up, all of you, to the roofs,

###### v2
_noisy_, ^[Literally "full of noises"] tumultuous city,
exultant town?
Your slain _are_ not slain by _the_ sword,
nor _are they_ dead from battle.

###### v3
All of your rulers have fled together without a bow;
all of _you who were found_ ^[Literally "your found ones"] were captured.
They were captured together;
they had fled far away.

###### v4
Therefore I said,
"Look away from me,
let me _weep bitterly_; ^[Literally "be bitter in weeping"]
you must not insist on comforting me
for the destruction of the daughter of my people."

###### v5
For the Lord Yahweh of hosts has a day of tumult and trampling and confusion ^[These three Hebrew words are alliterative: _m__e__hûm__â__ûm__e__ḇûs__â__ûm__e__ḇû__ḵâ_] in _the_ valley of vision,
_a_ tearing down of walls ^[Hebrew "wall"] and a cry for help to the mountains. ^[Hebrew "mountain"]

###### v6
And Elam lifted up _the_ quiver,
with chariots ^[Hebrew "chariot"] _of_ men ^[Hebrew "man"] _and_ cavalry.
And Kir uncovered _the_ shield.

###### v7
And this happened:
the choicest of your valleys were full of chariots, ^[Hebrew "chariot"]
and the cavalry confidently stood at the gate.

###### v8
        And he uncovered the covering of Judah.
And you looked, on that day, to the weapons ^[Hebrew "weapon"] of the House of the Forest,

###### v9
    and you saw that the breaches in the walls of the city of David were many,
and you gathered the waters of the lower pool.

###### v10
And you counted the houses of Jerusalem,
and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.

###### v11
        And you made a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the old pool,
but you did not look to its maker,
and you did not see _the one who created it long ago_. ^[Literally "its creator from far away"]

###### v12
And the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, called on that day
for weeping and mourning,
and for baldness and girding _with_ ^[Literally "of"] sackcloth.

###### v13
But look! Joy and gladness,
the killing of oxen ^[Hebrew "ox"] and the slaughtering of sheep,
the eating of meat and the drinking of wine!
"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!"

###### v14
And it was revealed in my ears _by_ Yahweh of hosts:
"Surely this sin will not be atoned for you until you die!"
says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.

###### v15
The Lord, Yahweh of hosts, says this:
"Go! Go to this steward, to Shebna,
who _is_ over the house:

###### v16
'What _business do you have_ ^[Literally "to you"] here,
and who _do you have_ ^[Literally "to you"] here,
that you have cut a grave cutting here for yourself,
carving his grave _on_ the height,
a dwelling place for him in the rock?

###### v17
Look! Yahweh _is_ about to _really hurl_ ^[Literally "hurl a hurling"] you, man!
And he _is_ about to grasp you firmly;

###### v18
        he will wind a winding tightly around you like _a_ ball, to a _wide land_. ^[Literally "land broad of sides"]
There you shall die,
and there the chariots of your splendor _will be_,
disgrace to your master's house!

###### v19
And I will push you from your office,
and he will throw you down from your position.

###### v20
And this shall happen:
On that day I will call to my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah,

###### v21
    and I will clothe him _with_ your tunic,
and I will bind your sash firmly about him,
and I will put your authority into his hand,
and he shall be like a father to the inhabitants ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"] of Jerusalem
and to the house of Judah.

###### v22
And I will put the key of the house of David on his shoulder,
and he shall open and no one _will be able to_ shut;
and he shall shut and no one _will be able to_ open.

###### v23
And I will drive him in _like_ a peg into a secure place,
and he will become like a throne of glory to the house of his father.

###### v24
And they will hang all of the heaviness of his father's house on him,
the offspring and the offshoot,
all of the small vessels,
from the _bowls to the jars_. ^[Literally "vessels of the bowls to all of the vessels of the jars"]

###### v25
On that day, _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts, the peg that was driven will move away into a secure place, and it will be cut down and fall, and the load that _was_ on her will be cut off. For Yahweh has spoken.'"
