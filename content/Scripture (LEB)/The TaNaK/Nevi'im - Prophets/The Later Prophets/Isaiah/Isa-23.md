###### v1
The oracle of Tyre:
Wail, ships of Tarshish, for _the house is destroyed so that no one can enter_; ^[Literally "it is destroyed from a house from entering"]
it is announced to them from the land of Cyprus.

###### v2
Be still, inhabitants of _the_ coast,
merchant of Sidon, who travels over _the_ sea, they filled you.

###### v3
And on _the_ great waters _is_ the seed of Shihor,
the harvest of the Nile _is_ its produce,
and she was _the_ merchandise of _the_ nations.

###### v4
Be ashamed, Sidon, for _the_ sea,
the fortress of the sea said, saying,
"I was not in labor,
and I have not given birth,
and I have not reared young men,
brought ^[Or "I have brought"] up young women."

###### v5
When _the_ report _comes_ to Egypt,
they will be in anguish at the report _about_ ^[Literally "of"] Tyre.

###### v6
Cross over _to_ Tarshish!
Wail, inhabitants of _the_ coast!

###### v7
_Is this your exultant one_, ^[Literally "this to you, exultant"] her origin from the days of long ago?
Her feet brought her to dwell afar as an alien.

###### v8
Who has planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, ^[Hebrew "crown"]
whose merchants _were_ princes,
her traders _the_ honored ones of _the_ earth?

###### v9
Yahweh of hosts has planned it:
to defile _the_ pride of all glory,
to humble all _the_ honored ones of _the_ earth.

###### v10
Cross over your _own_ land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish;
there is no longer a harbor. ^[Hebrew "waistband" is emended to "harbor" by transposing two consonants]

###### v11
He has stretched his hand out over the sea;
he has made kingdoms shake.
Yahweh has commanded concerning Canaan
to destroy her fortresses.

###### v12
And he said,
"You will not _continue_ ^[Literally "do again longer"] to exult, crushed one, _virgin_ ^[Literally "virgin of the"] daughter of Sidon.
Arise, cross over _to_ Cyprus! There will be no rest for you even there."

###### v13
Look _at_ the land of the Chaldeans!
_This people no longer exists._
_Assyria destined_ ^[Literally "this people was not Assyria destined," which could be translated "It was this people! It was not Assyria. They destined"] it for wild animals.
They erected its siege towers;
they demolished its citadel fortresses.
It made her like a ruin.

###### v14
Wail, ships of Tarshish!
For your fortress is destroyed.

###### v15
And this will happen on that day: And Tyre _will_ be forgotten seventy years, ^[Hebrew "year"]
like the days of one king. At _the_ end of seventy years, ^[Hebrew "year"] it will be for Tyre like the song of the prostitute:

###### v16
"Take a harp,
go around _the_ city, forgotten prostitute!
Do _it_ well, playing a stringed instrument!
Make numerous songs, ^[Hebrew "song"] that you may be remembered."

###### v17
And this shall happen:
at _the_ end of seventy years, ^[Hebrew "year"] Yahweh will visit Tyre,
and she will return to her harlot's wages,
and she will commit fornication
with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.

###### v18
And this shall happen:
her merchandise and her harlot's wages _will be_ set apart for Yahweh;
it will not be stored up,
and it will not be hoarded,
but her merchandise will be for those who live before the _presence_ ^[Literally "face"] of Yahweh,
for eating to satiation and for fine clothing.
