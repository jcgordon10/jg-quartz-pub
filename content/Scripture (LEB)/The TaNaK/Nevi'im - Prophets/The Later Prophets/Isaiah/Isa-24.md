###### v1
Look! Yahweh _is_ about to lay the earth waste
and _is_ about to devastate it,
and he will twist her surface,
and he will scatter her inhabitants.

###### v2
And it shall be as _with_ the people, so _with_ the priest;
as _with_ the slave, so _with_ his master;
as _with_ the female slave, so _with_ her mistress;
as _with_ the buyer, so _with_ the seller;
as _with_ the lender, so _with_ the borrower;
as _with_ the creditor, so _with_ _the one_ to whom he lends.

###### v3
The earth shall be utterly laid waste,
and it shall be utterly plundered,
for Yahweh has spoken this word.

###### v4
The earth dries up, it withers;
_the_ world languishes, it withers.
The elevated of the people of the earth languish,

###### v5
    and the earth is defiled beneath its inhabitants.
For they have transgressed laws;
they have passed by statutes; ^[Hebrew "statute"]
they have broken _the_ everlasting covenant.

###### v6
Therefore a curse devours _the_ earth,
and the inhabitants in it suffer for their guilt.
Therefore _the_ inhabitants of _the_ earth burn,
and _few men are left_. ^[Literally "he is left a man of smallness"]

###### v7
_The_ new wine dries up;
_the_ vine languishes.
All _the_ merry of heart sigh;

###### v8
    _the_ joy of _the_ tambourine has stopped.
The noise of _the_ jubilant has ceased;
_the_ joy of _the_ lyre has stopped.

###### v9
They do not drink wine with song;
strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.

###### v10
_The_ city of emptiness is broken;
every house is shut _so that no one can enter_; ^[Literally "from entering"]

###### v11
    _there is_ an outcry over the wine in the streets.
All joy turns into _darkness_; ^[Literally "evening"]
the joy of the earth disappears.

###### v12
Desolation is left in the city;
_the_ gate is crushed _into_ a state of ruin.

###### v13
For it shall be like this in the midst of the earth,
among the nations,
like _the_ beating of an olive tree,
like gleanings when a grape harvest is at an end.

###### v14
They lift up their voices; ^[Hebrew "voice"] they sing for joy;
they shout out from _the_ west over the majesty of Yahweh.

###### v15
Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east,
the name of Yahweh the God of Israel in the coastlands of the sea.

###### v16
We hear songs from the _edge_ ^[Literally "wing"] of the earth:
"Glory to the righteous _one_!"
But I say, "Ruin to me!
Ruin to me! Woe to me!
_The_ treacherous ones deal treacherously,
and _the_ treacherous ones deal treacherously _with_ treachery!"

###### v17
Terror and _the_ pit and _the_ snare _are_ upon you, inhabitants ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"] of the earth!

###### v18
And this shall happen:
The one who flees from the sound of the terror shall fall into the pit,
and the one who goes up from _inside the pit_ ^[Literally "the middle of the pit"] shall be caught in the snare,
for _the_ windows from heaven are opened,
and _the_ foundations of _the_ earth tremble.

###### v19
The earth is utterly broken;
_the_ earth is torn asunder;
_the_ earth is shaken violently.

###### v20
_The_ earth staggers to and fro like the drunkard,
and it sways like _a_ hut,
and its transgression is heavy upon it,
and it falls and does not rise again.

###### v21
And this shall happen on that day:
Yahweh will punish the host of heaven in heaven,
and the kings of the earth on the earth.

###### v22
And they will be gathered _in_ a gathering, _like_ a prisoner _in_ ^[Literally "on"] a pit.
And they will be shut _in_ ^[Literally "on"] a prison and be punished _after_ ^[Literally "from"] many days.

###### v23
And the full moon will be ashamed
and the sun will be ashamed,
for Yahweh of hosts will rule on _Mount Zion_ ^[Literally "the mountain of Zion"] and in Jerusalem,
and before his elders _in_ glory.
