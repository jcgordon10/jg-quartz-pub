[[Isa-24|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-26|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Yahweh, you _are_ my God; I will exalt you.
I will praise your name,
for you have done wonderful things, ^[Hebrew "thing"]
plans ^[Hebrew "plan"] _of old_, ^[Literally "from far away "] _in_ faithfulness, trustworthiness.

###### v2
For you have _made_ ^[Literally "placed"] _the_ city _a_ heap,
_the_ fortified city a ruin,
_the_ palace of foreigners _is no longer_ ^[Literally "from"] a city;
it will _never_ ^[Literally "to eternity not"] be rebuilt.

###### v3
Therefore strong peoples will glorify you;
a city of ruthless nations, they will fear you.

###### v4
For you have been a refuge to the poor,
a refuge to the needy in his distress,
a shelter from _the_ rainstorm,
a shade from _the_ heat.
For _the_ breath of _the_ ruthless _was_ like a rainstorm against a wall, ^[The same consonants with different vowels can be translated "winter rainstorm"]

###### v5
    _the_ noise of foreigners like heat in a dry land.
You subdued _the_ heat with _the_ shade of a cloud;
_the_ song of _the_ ruthless was silenced.

###### v6
And on this mountain Yahweh of hosts will make for all peoples a _rich feast_, ^[Literally "feast of fat"]
a feast of aged wines, fat filled with marrow, filtered aged wine.

###### v7
And on this mountain he will _destroy_ ^[Literally "engulf"] the face of the shroud,
the shroud over all peoples,
and the woven covering over all nations.

###### v8
He will _destroy_ ^[Literally "engulf"] death forever,
and the Lord Yahweh will wipe off _the_ tears from all faces,
and he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth,
for Yahweh has spoken.

###### v9
And one will say, on that day,
"Look! This _is_ our God! We have waited for him and he saved us!
This _is_ Yahweh; we waited for him!
Let us be glad,
and let us rejoice in his salvation."

###### v10
For the hand of Yahweh will rest on this mountain,
and Moab shall be trampled down under him
as _a heap of straw is trampled down_ ^[Literally "the trampling down of a heap of straw"] in _waters of_ ^[These words are in the written Hebrew text, but not in the reading tradition (_Qere_)] a dung heap.

###### v11
And it ^[Moab] will spread out its hands in the midst of it,
just as the swimmer spreads out to swim,
and its pride will be brought low with the movement ^[Meaning uncertain] of its hands.

###### v12
And he will throw down the fortification of the high point of your walls;
he will bring _it_ low;
he will _send it_ ^[Literally "cause _it_ to touch"] to the ground,
to _the_ dust.
