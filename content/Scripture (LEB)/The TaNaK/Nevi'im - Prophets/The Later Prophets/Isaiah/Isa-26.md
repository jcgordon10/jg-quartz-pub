###### v1
On that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
"_We have a strong city_; ^[Literally "a city of strength for us"]
he sets up victory _like_ walls and ramparts! ^[Hebrew "rampart"]

###### v2
Open _the_ gates _so that_ ^[Or "and"] _the_ righteous nation who keeps faithfulness may enter!

###### v3
You will protect a firm inclination _in_ peace,
_in_ peace because he trusts in you.

###### v4
Trust in Yahweh forever,
for in Yah, Yahweh _you have_ an everlasting rock.

###### v5
For he has thrown down _the_ inhabitants of _the_ height,
he lays low _the_ lofty city.
He lays it low to _the_ ground;
he throws her to _the_ dust.

###### v6
_The_ foot tramples it,
_the_ feet of _the_ poor, _the_ steps of _the_ needy."

###### v7
_The_ way of the righteous _is_ a straight path;
_you clear the level path of the righteous_. ^[Literally "_the_ level path of the righteous you make level"; the meaning of this phrase is uncertain]

###### v8
Surely we wait for you _in_ the path of your judgments, Yahweh,
for your name and renown _are the_ desire of _the_ soul.

###### v9
I desire you _with all_ my soul in the night;
also I seek you _with_ my spirit within me,
for when your judgments _are_ _upon_ ^[Literally "to"] the earth,
_the_ inhabitants of _the_ world learn righteousness.

###### v10
_Though the_ wicked person is shown compassion, he does not learn righteousness;
he acts unjustly in _the_ land _of_ uprightness,
and he does not see the majesty of Yahweh.

###### v11
Yahweh, _though_ your hand reaches high, they do not see _it_.
Let them see, and let them be ashamed of _the_ zeal of people.
Indeed, let the fire of your enemies consume them.

###### v12
Yahweh, you will establish peace for us,
for you have done even all of our works for us.

###### v13
Yahweh, our God, lords besides you ruled over us,
_but we praise your name alone_. ^[Literally "alone in you we praise name you"]

###### v14
_The_ dead do not live;
dead spirits do not rise
because you have punished and destroyed them,
and you have destroyed all memory of them.

###### v15
You have added to the nation, Yahweh.
You have added to the nation; you are honored.
You have extended all _the_ ends of _the_ land.

###### v16
Yahweh, in distress they have visited you;
they poured out an _incantation_; ^[Literally "whispering"]
your discipline _was_ on them.

###### v17
Like _a_ pregnant woman on the point of giving birth, she writhes;
she cries in her labor pains.
So we were because of your presence, Yahweh.

###### v18
We became pregnant, we writhed;
we gave birth _to_ wind.
We cannot bring about deliverance _on the_ earth,
and no inhabitants of _the_ world are born.

###### v19
Your dead shall live; _their corpses_ ^[Literally "my corpse;" some manuscripts propose an emendation to the suffix to change it to third person masculine plural ("their corpses"), which makes better sense] shall rise.
Wake up and sing for joy, dwellers of _the_ dust,
for your dew _is_ _celestial dew_, ^[Literally "dew of light"]
and the earth will give birth to dead spirits. ^[Or "you make the land of Rephaim fall"]

###### v20
Go, my people, enter into your chambers
and shut your doors ^[The reading tradition (_Qere_) is singular] behind you;
hide for _a very little_ ^[Literally "a little a little"] while,
until _the_ wrath has passed over.

###### v21
For look! Yahweh _is_ about to come out from his place
to punish the iniquity of the inhabitants ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"] of the earth against him,
and the earth will disclose her blood
and will no longer cover her slain.
