[[Isa-26|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-28|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
On that day, Yahweh will punish with his cruel, great and strong sword Leviathan, _the_ fleeing serpent, and Leviathan, _the_ twisting serpent, and he will kill the sea monster that _is_ in the sea.

###### v2
On that day:
"A vineyard of beauty! Sing in praise of it!

###### v3
    I, Yahweh, _am_ her keeper;
I water it _again and again_. ^[Literally "by moments"]
Lest one afflict _harm_ on it,
I guard it night and day;

###### v4
    _I have no wrath_. ^[Literally "There is no wrath for me"]
Whatever gives me thorns _and_ briers,
I will step forth against in battle.
I will set it on fire altogether.

###### v5
Or let it grasp at my protection;
let it make peace with me;
peace let it make with me."

###### v6
_Days are coming_, ^[Literally "The coming ones"] let Jacob take root;
Israel will blossom and send out shoots,
and they will fill _the_ face of _the_ world _with_ fruit.

###### v7
Does he strike him _as he struck down those who struck him_? ^[Literally "like the striking of one striking him"]
Or is he killed _as those who killed him were killed_? ^[Literally "like the killing of his killed ones"]

###### v8
By expelling ^[Meaning uncertain, derived from the following parallel expression] her, by her sending away, you argue with her.
He removed _them_ with his strong wind,
in _the_ day of _the_ east wind.

###### v9
Therefore by this he will make atonement _for_ the guilt of Jacob,
and this _will be_ all of _the_ fruit _of_ the removal of his sin:
_when he makes_ ^[Literally "in his setting"] all _the_ stones of _the_ altar like crushed stones of chalk,
no poles of Asherah worship or incense altars will stand.

###### v10
For _the_ fortified city _is_ solitary,
a settlement deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness;
_the_ calf grazes there,
lies down there and destroys its branches.

###### v11
_When its branches are dry_, ^[Literally "In her branch being dry"] they are broken;
women _are_ coming _and_ setting light to it.
For it _is_ not a people of understanding;
therefore his maker will not have compassion on him,
and his creator will not show him favor.

###### v12
And this shall happen:
on that day, Yahweh will thresh from the floodwaters of the Euphrates to the wadi ^[A seasonal stream that is often dry] of Egypt, and _as for_ you, you will be gathered one by one, sons of Israel.

###### v13
And this shall happen:
on that day, a great trumpet will be blown,
and those who were lost in the land of Assyria will come,
and those who were scattered in the land of Egypt,
and they will bow down to Yahweh on the _holy mountain_ ^[Literally "mountain of holiness"] at Jerusalem.
