###### v1
Ah! The garland of the pride of the drunkards of Ephraim
and _the_ withering flower of the glory of his beauty,
which _is_ at _the_ head of _the rich valley_, ^[Literally "a valley of fat"]
_ones overcome_ ^[Literally "ones struck"] with wine!

###### v2
Look! The Lord has _a_ mighty and strong _one_,
like a rainstorm of hail, a wind storm of destruction,
like a rainstorm of mighty overflowing waters,
he will put _them_ to the earth with _his_ hand.

###### v3
The garland of the pride of the drunkards of Ephraim
will be trampled ^[The Hebrew is plural] by feet,

###### v4
and _the_ withering flower of the glory of its beauty
which _is_ at _the_ head of _the rich valley_ ^[Literally "a valley of fat"]
will be like its early fig before summer,
_which the one who sees it swallows_ ^[Literally "Which, when the one who sees it sees it, he swallows it"] while it _is_ still in his hand.

###### v5
In that day, Yahweh of hosts will become a garland of glory
and a diadem of beauty to the remnant of his people,

###### v6
and a spirit of justice to the one who sits over judgment,
and strength _to_ those who turn back _the_ battle _at the_ gate.

###### v7
And these also stagger because of wine
and stagger because of strong drink;
priest and prophet stagger because of strong drink;
they are confused ^[Or "swallowed"] because of wine.
They stagger because of strong drink;
they err in vision.
They stagger _in the_ rendering of a decision,

###### v8
    for all _the_ tables are full _of_ disgusting vomit, _with no place left_. ^[Literally "without a place"]

###### v9
_To_ whom will he teach knowledge,
and _to_ whom will he explain _the_ message?
Those who are weaned from milk,
_those_ taken from _the_ breast?

###### v10
For _it is_ blah-blah upon blah-blah,
blah-blah upon blah-blah,
gah-gah upon gah-gah,
gah-gah upon gah-gah, ^[In this context, the Hebrew expressions _tsaw-tsaw_ and _qaw-qaw_ are likely meant to sound like baby talk, but they could mean "command upon command" and "rule upon rule"]
a little here, a little there.

###### v11
For he will speak with _stammering_ ^[Literally "stammer of lip"] and another tongue to this people,

###### v12
to whom he has said,
"This _is_ rest; give rest to the weary;
and this _is_ repose"; yet ^[Or "and"] they were not willing to hear.

###### v13
And to them the word of Yahweh will be
blah-blah upon blah-blah
blah-blah upon blah-blah
gah-gah upon gah-gah
gah-gah upon gah-gah, ^[In this context, the Hebrew expressions _tsaw-tsaw_ and _qaw-qaw_ are likely meant to sound like baby talk, but they could mean "command upon command" and "rule upon rule"]
a little here, a little there,
so that they may go and stumble backward
and be broken and ensnared and captured.

###### v14
Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, men of mockery,
rulers of these people in Jerusalem:

###### v15
Because you have said,
"We have _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] a covenant with death,
and we have made an agreement with Sheol.
_The_ overwhelming flood, when it passes through, will not come to us,
for we have made lies ^[Hebrew "lie"] our refuge,
and we have hidden ourselves in falsehood."

###### v16
Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this:
"Look! I _am_ laying a stone in Zion,
a _tested_ ^[Literally "testing"] stone,
a precious cornerstone,
a founded foundation:
'The one who trusts will not _panic_.' ^[Literally "hurry"]

###### v17
And I will make justice _the_ measuring line,
and righteousness _the_ plumb line;
and hail will sweep away _the_ refuge of lies, ^[Hebrew "lie"]
and waters will flood over _the_ hiding place.

###### v18
And your covenant with death will be annulled,
and your agreement with Sheol will not stand;
you will become a trampling place for the overwhelming flood when it passes through.

###### v19
    _As often as it passes through_, ^[Literally "From enough his passing through"] it will take you,
for _morning by morning_ ^[Literally "in the morning in the morning"] it will pass through,
in the day and in the night,
and understanding _the_ message will be only terror."

###### v20
For the bed is too short _to stretch out on_, ^[Literally "from stretching oneself"]
and the covering is _too_ narrow when wrapping oneself.

###### v21
For Yahweh will rise up as _at_ Mount Perazim;
he will rave as _in the_ valley at Gibeon
to do his deed--his deed _is_ strange--
and to work his work--his work _is_ alien!

###### v22
And now you must not scoff,
or your bonds will be strong,
for I have heard from the Lord, Yahweh of hosts:
complete destruction
decreed upon all the land.

###### v23
Listen, and hear my voice!
Listen attentively, and hear my word!

###### v24
Is it all day _that_ the plowman plows,
opens to sow seed, harrows his ground?

###### v25
When he has leveled its _surface_, ^[Literally "face"] does he not scatter dill,
and sow cumin seed,
and _plant_ ^[Literally "place"] wheat _in_ planted rows, ^[Hebrew "row"]
and barley _in_ an appointed place,
and spelt grain _as_ its border?

###### v26
And his God instructs him about the prescription; ^[That is, "the proper way"]
he teaches him.

###### v27
For dill is not threshed with _a_ threshing sledge,
nor is a wheel of a utility cart _rolled_ ^[Literally "turned"] over cumin,
but dill is beaten out with _a_ stick,
and cumin with _a_ rod.

###### v28
Grain is crushed fine,
but certainly one does not thresh it forever;
and one drives the wheel of his cart,
but his horses do not crush it.

###### v29
This also comes forth from Yahweh of hosts.
He is wonderful _in_ advice;
he makes great wisdom.
