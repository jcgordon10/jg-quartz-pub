###### v1
Ah! Ariel, Ariel, _the_ city _where_ David encamped!
Add year to year,
let festivals recur.

###### v2
Yet ^[Or "And"] I will inflict Ariel,
and there shall be mourning and lamentation,
and it shall be to me like an altar hearth. ^[Hebrew "Ariel," which might mean "altar hearth"]

###### v3
And I will encamp _in a circle_ ^[The Hebrew text literally reads "like the ball"; the LXX supports an emendation to "David"] against you,
and I will lay siege to you _with_ towers ^[Hebrew "tower"]
and I will raise up siegeworks against you.

###### v4
Then ^[Or "And"] you shall be low;
you shall speak from _the_ earth,
and your words ^[Hebrew "word"] will be low, from dust.
And your voice will be from _the_ earth, like a ghost,
and your word will whisper from _the_ dust.

###### v5
But ^[Or "And"] the multitude of your strangers shall be like fine dust,
and _the_ multitude of tyrants like chaff that passes by.
And it will happen _in_ an instant, suddenly.

###### v6
You will be punished by Yahweh of hosts
with thunder and earthquake and great sound,
storm wind and tempest and _the_ flame of a devouring fire.

###### v7
And the multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel,
all those who fight _against_ her and her stronghold,
and those who inflict her shall be like _a_ dream, a vision of _the_ night.

###### v8
And it shall be as when the hungry person dreams--look, _he is_ eating!
And he wakes up and his inner self _is_ empty.
Or ^[Or "And"] as when the thirsty person dreams--look, _he is_ drinking!
And he wakes up and look, _he is_ faint,
and his inner self _is_ longing for water.
So shall be the multitude of all the nations who fight against Mount Zion.

###### v9
Be astonished and be amazed!
Blind yourselves and be blinded!
They are drunk but ^[Or "and"] not _from_ wine;
they stagger but ^[Or "and"] not _from_ strong drink.

###### v10
For Yahweh has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep,
and he has shut your eyes, the prophets,
and he has covered your heads, the seers.

###### v11
And the vision of all this has become for you like _the_ words of _a_ sealed document. When they give it to one who knows the ^[The reading tradition (_Qere_) has "a" instead of "the"] document, saying, "_Read_ ^[Literally "Call"] this now!" He says, "I am not able, for it _is_ sealed."

###### v12
And _if_ the document is given to _one_ who does not _know how to read_, ^[Literally "know a document"] saying, "_Read_ ^[Literally "Call"] this now!" he says, "I do not _know how to read_." ^[Literally "know a document"]

###### v13
And the Lord said,
"Because this people draw near with its mouth,
and with its lips it honors me,
and its heart is far from me,
and their fear of me is a commandment of men that has been taught,

###### v14
therefore look, I am again doing something spectacular
and a spectacle with this spectacular people.
And the wisdom of its wise men shall perish,
and the discernment of its discerning ones shall keep itself hidden."

###### v15
Ah! Those who make a plan deep, to hide _it_ from Yahweh,
and their deeds are ^[The Hebrew is singular] in a dark place.
And they say, "Who sees us?
And who knows us?"

###### v16
Your perversity!
As if _a potter_ ^[Literally "of the one who creates"] shall be regarded as _the_ clay!
That _the_ product of its maker _says_,
"He did not make me,"
and _the_ thing made into shape says of its _potter_, ^[Literally "one who creates"]
"He has no understanding."

###### v17
_In a very little while_ ^[Literally "Not still a trifling _of time_"] shall not Lebanon change into _a_ fruitful land,
and the fruitful land be regarded as _a_ forest?

###### v18
And on that day, the deaf shall hear _the_ words of a scroll,
and _the_ eyes of _the_ blind shall see out of gloom and darkness.

###### v19
And _the_ meek _have joy after joy_ ^[Literally "shall add joy"] in Yahweh,
and _the_ needy of _the_ people shall rejoice in the holy one of Israel.

###### v20
For _the_ tyrant shall be no more,
and _the_ scoffer shall come to an end.
And all those lying in wait for evil shall be cut off;

###### v21
    those who mislead a person into sin with a word
and set a trap for the _arbitrator_ ^[Literally "one who argues"] in the gate
and guide away _the_ righteous by emptiness.

###### v22
Therefore Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, says this to the house of Jacob:
"Jacob will no longer be ashamed,
and his face will no longer grow pale.

###### v23
For when he sees his children,
the work of my hands, in his midst,
they will treat my name as holy,
and they will treat the holy one of Jacob as holy,
and they will stand in awe _of_ the God of Israel.

###### v24
And those who err _in_ spirit will _acquire_ ^[Literally "know"] understanding,
and those who grumble will learn instruction.
