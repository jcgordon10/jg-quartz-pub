###### v1
"Oh rebellious children!" _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh,
"to make a plan, but ^[Or "and"] not from me,
and pour out a libation, but ^[Or "and"] not _from_ my Spirit,
_so as to add_ ^[Literally "for the sake of adding"] sin to sin.

###### v2
Who go to go down _to_ Egypt,
but ^[Or "and"] they do not ask _of_ my mouth,
to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh
and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt.

###### v3
And the protection of Pharaoh shall be shame to you,
and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt, humiliation.

###### v4
For his officials are at Zoan,
and his envoys reach to Hanes.

###### v5
Everyone will start to stink because of a people _that_ cannot profit them,
not for help and not for profiting,

###### v6
An oracle of the animals of the Negev:
Through a land of trouble and distress,
_of_ lioness and lion,
_among_ ^[Literally "from"] them _are_ snake and flying serpent;
they carry their wealth on _the_ _backs_ ^[Literally "shoulder"] of male donkeys
and their treasures on _the_ humps ^[Hebrew "hump"] of camels,
to a people _that_ cannot profit _them_.

###### v7
For ^[Or "And"] _Egyptians_ ^[Literally "Egypt"] help _with_ vanity and emptiness,
therefore I have called this one "Rahab, they _are_ sitting."

Now go, write it on a tablet with them,
and inscribe it on a scroll,
_that_ ^[Or "and"] it may be _for the time to come_, ^[Literally "for last day"]
forever, forever.

###### v9
For it _is_ a people of rebellion, deceitful children,
children _who are_ not willing to hear the instruction of Yahweh,

###### v10
who say to those who do see, "You must not see!"
and to the seers, "You must not see truth for us;
speak smooth things to us,
see illusions,

###### v11
turn aside from _the_ way, turn aside from _the_ path,
put an end to the holy one of Israel from our face."

###### v12
Therefore the holy one of Israel says this:
"Because you _are_ rejecting this word
and you trust in oppression and _cunning_ ^[Literally "going wrong"]
and you rely on it,

###### v13
therefore this iniquity shall come for you like a breach about to fall,
bulging out on a high wall _that breaks_ ^[Literally "whose breaking comes"] suddenly, _in_ an instant.

###### v14
And he breaks it like a vessel of _a potter_ ^[Literally "someone who forms"] breaks,
_that_ is crushed; he has no compassion,
and no potsherd is found among its fragments ^[Hebrew "fragment"] _to take fire_ ^[Literally "for the taking away of fire"] from _the_ hearth,
or _to skim_ ^[Literally "for the skimming off of"] water from _the_ cistern."

###### v15
For the Lord Yahweh, the holy one of Israel, said this:
"In returning and rest you shall be saved;
your strength shall be in quietness and in trust."
But ^[Or "And"] you were not willing,

###### v16
and you said,
"No! For we will flee on horses!" ^[Hebrew "horse"] Therefore you shall flee!
And, "We will ride on swift horses!" ^[Hebrew "horse"] Therefore your pursuers shall be swift!

###### v17
One thousand _because of_ ^[Literally "from _the_ face of"] a threat of one,
_because_ ^[Literally "from _the_ face"] of a threat of five you shall flee,
until you are left like _a_ flagstaff on _top_ ^[Literally "head"] of _a_ mountain,
and like _a_ signal on _a_ hill.

###### v18
Therefore Yahweh waits to be gracious _to_ you,
and therefore he will rise up to show you mercy,
for Yahweh _is_ a God of justice;
blessed _are_ all those who wait for him.

###### v19
For people will live in Zion;
in Jerusalem, you will surely not weep.
Surely he will be gracious to you;
when he hears the sound of your cry, he will answer you.

###### v20
And the Lord will give you _the_ bread _of_ distress
and _the_ water _of_ oppression,
but ^[Or "and"] your teachers will not hide themselves ^[Hebrew "himself"] any longer.
And your eyes _shall see_ ^[Literally "be seeing"] your teachers.

###### v21
And your ears shall hear a word from behind you, saying,
"this _is_ the way; walk in it,"
when you go to your right
and when you go to your left.

###### v22
And you will defile the plating of your silver idols
and the covering of your gold image.
You will scatter them like contaminated things; ^[Hebrew "contaminated thing"]
you will say to it, "Filth!" ^[Or "Get out!"]

###### v23
And he will give rain for your seed _with_ which you sow the ground,
and grain, the produce of the ground, and it will be rich and _fertile_. ^[Literally "fat"]
On that day, your cattle will graze _in_ broad pastures; ^[Hebrew "pasture"]

###### v24
    and the oxen and the donkeys that till ^[Or "tilling"] the ground will eat fodder, sorrel
that _has_ been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork.

###### v25
And there will be streams on every high mountain and elevated hill,
watercourses of water, on a day of great slaughter, when towers fall.

###### v26
And the light of the full moon will be like the light of the sun,
and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days,
on _the_ day _when_ Yahweh binds up the breakage of his people,
and he heals the wound of his blow.

###### v27
Look! The name of Yahweh comes from afar,
burning _with_ his anger and heaviness of cloud.
His lips are full _of_ indignation,
and his tongue _is_ like a devouring fire.

###### v28
And his breath _is_ like an overflowing river;
it reaches up to _the_ neck
to shake _the_ nations with _the_ sieve of worthlessness;
and a bridle that leads astray _is_ on _the_ jawbones of _the_ peoples.

###### v29
_You shall have a song_ ^[Literally "There shall be a song for you"] as _in_ _the_ night when a holy festival is kept,
and a gladness of heart like one who goes with the flute,
to go to the mountain of Yahweh, to the rock of Israel.

###### v30
And Yahweh will cause the majesty of his voice to be heard,
and he will cause the descent of his arm to be seen,
in furious anger and a flame of devouring fire,
_with_ a cloudburst and a rainstorm and stones ^[Hebrew "stone"] of hail.

###### v31
Indeed, Assyria will be shattered by the voice of Yahweh;
he strikes with the rod.

###### v32
And every stroke of _the_ staff of foundation ^[Some translations emend this to "discipline"] that Yahweh lays will be on it with timbrels and lyres,
and he will fight against it ^[The reading tradition (_Qere_) has "them"] with battles of brandishing.

###### v33
For Topheth has been prepared from yesterday;
indeed, it is made ready for the king.
He makes its pile of wood deep and wide;
he makes fire and wood _abundant_. ^[Literally "numerous"]
The breath of Yahweh burns in it like a stream of sulfur.
