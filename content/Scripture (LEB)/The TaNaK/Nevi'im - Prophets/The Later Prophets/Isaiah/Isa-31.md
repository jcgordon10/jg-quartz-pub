###### v1
Ah! Those who go down _to_ Egypt for help!
They rely on horses
and trust in chariots because _they are_ many,
and in horsemen because they are very numerous,
and they do not look to the holy one of Israel,
and they do not consult Yahweh.

###### v2
And indeed, he _is_ wise, and he brings disaster,
and he does not remove his words,
and he will rise against _the_ house of evildoers
and against _the_ help of workers of iniquity.

###### v3
And the Egyptians _are_ human and not God,
and their horses _are_ flesh and not spirit.
And Yahweh stretches out his hand,
and _the_ helper will stumble,
and _the_ one being helped will fall,
and together all of them will come to an end. ^[Or "perish"]

###### v4
For Yahweh said this to me:
"As which _a_ lion growls
and _a_ young lion over its prey
when _a full group_ ^[Literally "fullness"] of shepherds is called against him,
it is not terrified by their voice,
and to their noise it does not respond,
so Yahweh of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion
and upon its hill.

###### v5
Like birds flying _overhead_, so Yahweh of hosts will protect Jerusalem;
he will protect and deliver _it_;
he will pass over and rescue _it_.

###### v6
Turn back to _the one against_ whom the sons of Israel have made deep rebellion.

###### v7
For on that day, each one will reject his idols of silver
and his idols of gold which your hands have made _in_ sin for you.

###### v8
And Assyria shall fall by a sword not _of_ a man,
and a sword not _of_ a human shall devour him;
and he shall flee from _the_ sword,
and his young men shall be _put_ to forced labor.

###### v9
And his rock will pass over because of terror,
and his officers will be terrified because of _the_ flag,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh,
who has a fire in Zion
and has a furnace in Jerusalem.
