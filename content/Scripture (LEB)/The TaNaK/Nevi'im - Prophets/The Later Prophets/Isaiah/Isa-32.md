[[Isa-31|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-33|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
See, a king will rule according to righteousness,
and princes will rule according to justice.

###### v2
And each one will be like a hiding place from _the_ wind
and a covering from _the_ rainstorm,
like streams of water in a dry region,
like _the_ shade of a large rock in a weary land.

###### v3
And _the_ eyes of those who see will not gaze, ^[The same consonants with different vowels would be translated "be blinded," which fits the context better]
and _the_ ears of those who hear will listen.

###### v4
And _the_ _minds_ ^[Literally "heart"] of _the_ rash will understand _knowledge_, ^[Literally "to know"]
and _the_ tongues ^[Hebrew "tongue"] of stammerers will hasten to speak clearly.

###### v5
A fool will no longer be called noble,
and a scoundrel will not be said _to be_ eminent.

###### v6
For a fool speaks folly,
and his _mind_ ^[Literally "heart"] does iniquity:
to _behave wickedly_, ^[Literally "do ungodliness"]
and to speak error concerning Yahweh,
to leave _the_ throat of _the_ hungry empty,
and he deprives _the_ thirsty _of_ drink.

###### v7
And a scoundrel, his weapons _are_ evil;
he plans evil devices
to ruin _the_ poor with words of deception
even ^[Or "and"] when the speech of _the_ needy _is_ right.

###### v8
But ^[Or "And"] _the_ nobleman plans noble things,
and he stands upon noble things.

###### v9
Women _who are_ at ease, rise up; hear my voice!
Carefree daughters, listen _to_ my word!

###### v10
_In a year_ ^[Literally "_In_ days upon a year"] you will tremble, carefree ones,
for _the_ vintage will come to an end;
_the_ harvest will not come.

###### v11
Tremble, _you who are_ at ease;
tremble, carefree ones;
strip, and strip yourself,
and gird yourself on _your_ loins, ^[Although the carefree and at ease addressees in this verse are feminine plural ("you women"), the commands are masculine singular in form]

###### v12
mourning over breasts,
over fields of delight,
over _the_ fruitful vine,

###### v13
    over the soil of my people.
It goes up _in_ thorns ^[Hebrew "thorn"] _and_ briers, ^[Hebrew "brier"]
indeed over all of _the_ houses of joy _in the_ jubilant city.

###### v14
For _the_ palace will be forsaken,
_the_ _crowded city_ ^[Literally "crowd of _the_ city"] deserted;
_the_ hill and _the_ watchtower will become ^[The Hebrew text has "for the benefit of" following "become"] a cave forever,
_the_ joy of wild asses, a pasture _for_ ^[Literally "of"] flocks.

###### v15
Until a spirit is poured out on us from on high,
and _the_ wilderness becomes _a_ fruitful field,
and _the_ fruitful field is reckoned as the forest.

###### v16
Then ^[Or "And"] justice will dwell in the wilderness,
and righteousness will live in the fruitful field.

###### v17
And the work of righteousness will be peace,
and the work of righteousness, quietness and security forever.

###### v18
And my people will dwell in a settlement of peace
and in a dwelling place of security
and in undisturbed resting places.

###### v19
And it hails when _the forest comes down_, ^[Literally "the coming down of the forest"]
and the city will become low in humiliation.

###### v20
Happy _are_ you who sow by all waters,
who let the foot of the ox and the donkey go free.
