###### v1
Ah, destroyer, and yourself not destroyed!
And treacherous one, and no one has dealt treacherously with him! ^[Many manuscripts suggest "you" rather than "him"]
When you _cease_ ^[Literally "finishing"] destroying, you will be destroyed.
When you stop dealing treacherously, one will deal treacherously with you.

###### v2
Yahweh, be gracious to us, we wait for you.
Be our ^[Hebrew "their"] arm in the mornings,
indeed our salvation in _the_ time of trouble.

###### v3
At _the_ sound of tumult, peoples fled;
because of your exaltation, nations scattered.

###### v4
And your spoil is gathered,
_as_ the gathering of the locust,
as a swarm of locusts storming on it.

###### v5
Yahweh _is_ exalted, for _he_ dwells _on_ high;
he filled Zion _with_ justice and righteousness,

###### v6
and he will be the security of your times,
an abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge.
The fear of Yahweh _is_ his treasure.

###### v7
Look! Their heroes cry out _in the_ street;
_the_ messengers of peace weep bitterly.

###### v8
Highways are deserted;
_the_ traveler _on the_ road ceases.
One breaks a treaty,
he rejects _the_ cities, ^[A Dead Sea Scroll reads "witnesses"]
he does not hold man in high regard.

###### v9
_The_ land mourns; it languishes.
Lebanon feels abashed; it withers.
Sharon is like the desert,
and Bashan and Carmel _are losing their leaves_. ^[Literally "shaking off"]

###### v10
"Now I will arise," says Yahweh.
"Now I will lift myself up proudly;
now I will raise myself.

###### v11
You conceive dry grass, you bring forth stubble;
your breath _is_ a fire; it will consume you.

###### v12
And _the_ peoples will be burning _to_ lime--
they are burned _like_ thorns _that have been_ cut down in the fire.

###### v13
_You who are_ far away, hear what I have done;
and _you who are_ near, know my might!"

###### v14
Sinners are afraid in Zion;
trembling has seized _the_ godless:
"Who of us can _live_ ^[Literally "dwell as an alien"] _with_ devouring fire?
Who of us can _live_ ^[Literally "dwell as an alien"] _with_ everlasting consuming hearths?"

###### v15
He who walks _in_ righteousness
and speaks uprightness,
who rejects _the_ gain of extortion,
who _refuses_ ^[Literally "shakes his hand from the taking of"] _a_ bribe,
who stops up his ears ^[Hebrew "ear"] from hearing _bloodshed_ ^[Literally "blood"]
and shuts his eyes from seeing evil.

###### v16
That one will live _on the_ heights;
_the_ fortresses of rocks _will be_ his refuge.
His food _will_ be given;
his waters ^[Hebrew "water"] _will_ endure.

###### v17
Your eyes will see _the_ king in his beauty;
they will see a _distant land_. ^[Literally "land of distance"]

###### v18
Your _mind_ ^[Literally "heart"] will meditate _on the_ terror:
"Where _is the_ one who counted?
Where _is the_ one who weighed out?
Where _is the_ one who counted the towers?"

###### v19
You will not see _the_ insolent people,
_the_ people _whose language is too obscure to understand_, ^[Literally "obscure of lip than to hear"]
_whose_ stammering of tongue _cannot be understood_. ^[Literally "there is no understanding"]

###### v20
Look _on_ Zion, the city of our appointed festivals!
Your eyes will see Jerusalem,
an undisturbed settlement,
a tent _that is not moved_. ^[Literally "not he is loaded"]
No one will ever pull out its tent pegs,
and none of its ropes will be torn in two.

###### v21
Rather, there Yahweh _will be_ mighty for us,
a place of rivers _and_ _broad streams_, ^[Literally "streams broad of hands"]
a galley ship with ^[Or "of"] oars ^[Hebrew "oar"] cannot go in it,
and a mighty ship cannot pass through it.

###### v22
For Yahweh _is_ our judge; Yahweh _is_ our lawgiver.
Yahweh _is_ our king; he _is the one who_ will save us.

###### v23
Your riggings hang slack;
they do not hold the base of their mast firm,
they do not spread out _the_ sail.
Then _the_ prey of spoil _in_ abundance will be divided;
_the_ lame will take plunder.

###### v24
And no inhabitant will say, "I am sick";
the people who live in it, _their_ iniquity _will be_ taken away.
