[[Isa-33|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-35|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Come near, nations, to hear;
and peoples, listen attentively!
Let the earth hear, and that which fills it;
_the_ world and all its offspring.

###### v2
For _the_ anger of Yahweh _is_ against all the nations,
and _his_ wrath _is_ against all their armies;
he has put them under a ban,
he has given them up for slaughter.

###### v3
And their slain shall be cast out;
as for ^[Or "and"] their corpses, their stench shall go up.
And _the_ mountains shall melt with ^[Or "from"] their blood,

###### v4
    and all the host of heaven shall rot.
And the skies shall roll up like _a_ scroll,
and all their host shall wither
like the withering of a leaf from a vine,
or ^[Or "and"] like _the_ withering from a fig tree.

###### v5
When my sword is drenched in the heavens,
look! It will descend upon Edom,
and upon the people of my ban, for judgment.

###### v6
_Yahweh has a sword_; ^[Literally "A sword for Yahweh"]
it is full _of_ blood.
It is covered with ^[Or "from"] fat,
with ^[Or "from"] _the_ blood of lambs and goats,
with ^[Or "from"] _the_ fat of _the_ kidneys of rams,
for _Yahweh has a sacrifice_ ^[Literally "a sacrifice for Yahweh"] in Bozrah
and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.

###### v7
And wild oxen shall go down with them,
and steers with strong bulls.
And their land shall be drenched with ^[Or "from"] blood,
and their soil shall be fattened with ^[Or "from"] fat.

###### v8
For _Yahweh has a day of vengeance_, ^[Literally "a day of vengeance for Yahweh"]
a year of retribution for the strife of Zion.

###### v9
And its streams shall be changed to pitch and its soil to sulfur,
and its land shall become like burning pitch.

###### v10
Night and day it shall not be quenched;
its smoke shall go up forever.
From generation to generation it shall be in ruins;
forever and ever there will be no one who passes through her.

###### v11
But ^[Or "And"] _the_ large bird and _the_ hedgehog shall take possession of it,
and _the_ owl and _the_ raven shall live in it.
And he shall stretch _the_ measuring line of confusion out over it,
and _the_ plumb line of emptiness.

###### v12
Its nobles--but no kingdom is there--shall call,
and all its princes shall be nothing.

###### v13
And thorns shall go up her citadel fortress,
weeds ^[Hebrew "weed"] and thistle plants ^[Hebrew "thistle plant"] in her fortresses;
and it shall be _the_ settlement of jackals,
green grass for _the_ daughters of an ostrich.

###### v14
And desert creatures shall meet with hyenas,
and a goat-demon shall call to his neighbor;
surely there Lilith ^[Hebrew transliteration; possibly a proper name for a Mesopotamian night-demon] shall repose,
and she shall find a resting place for herself.

###### v15
There _the_ owl shall nest and lay
and hatch and care for her chicks in her shadow;
surely there _the_ birds of prey shall be gathered,
each one _with_ her mate.

###### v16
Seek from the book of Yahweh and _read_; ^[Literally "call"]
none of these shall be missing;
none shall miss her mate.
For my ^[The Dead Sea Scroll has "his"] mouth _is the one that_ ^[Literally "he"] has commanded,
and his spirit _is the one that_ ^[Literally "he"] has gathered them.

###### v17
And he _is the one that_ ^[Literally "he"] has cast _the_ lot for them,
and his hand has apportioned it to them with the measuring line;
they shall take possession of it forever,
they shall live in it _from generation to generation_. ^[Literally "to generation and generation"]
