[[Isa-34|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-36|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Wilderness and dry land shall be glad, ^[The Hebrew has an extra "them," probably from an accidental of the first letter of the next word]
and desert shall rejoice and blossom like the crocus.

###### v2
It shall blossom abundantly,
and it shall rejoice indeed with rejoicing and exulting.
The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it,
the majesty of Carmel and Sharon.
_They are the ones who_ ^[Literally "they"] shall see the glory of Yahweh,
the majesty of our God.

###### v3
Strengthen _the_ weak hands
and make _the_ staggering knees firm.

###### v4
Say to those who are hasty of heart,
"Be strong; you must not fear!
Look! your God will come _with_ vengeance,
_with_ _divine retribution_. ^[Literally "the retribution of gods"]
He _is the one who_ ^[Literally "he"] will come and save you."

###### v5
Then _the_ eyes of _the_ blind shall be opened,
and _the_ ears of _the_ deaf shall be opened.

###### v6
Then _the_ lame shall leap like the deer,
and _the_ tongue of _the_ dumb shall sing for joy,
for waters shall break forth in the wilderness
and streams in the desert.

###### v7
And the parched ground shall become _a_ pool,
and _the_ thirsty ground springs of water.
Her resting place _is_ in a settlement of jackals;
_the_ grass _shall become_ like reeds ^[Hebrew "reed"] and rushes. ^[Hebrew "rush"]

###### v8
And a highway shall be there, and a way,
and it shall be called the way of holiness.
_The_ unclean shall not travel through it,
but ^[Or "and"] it _is_ for them, he who walks _on the_ way;
and fools shall not wander about.

###### v9
No lion shall be there,
and no ferocious wild beast shall go up it.
It shall not be found there,
but ^[Or "and"] _the_ redeemed shall walk _there_.

###### v10
And the ransomed of Yahweh shall return,
and they shall come _to_ Zion with rejoicing.
And everlasting joy _shall be_ on their head;
joy and gladness shall overtake _them_,
and sorrow and sighing shall flee.
