###### v1
And this happened: In _the fourteenth year_ ^[Literally "four ten year"] of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria went up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and he captured them.

###### v2
And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh ^[Rabshekah is the title of a high Assyrian official] from Lachish to Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah, with a large army, and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on _the_ highway of _the_ field of _the_ washer.

###### v3
And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who _was in charge of the palace_, ^[Literally "_was_ over the house"] came out to him, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the reminder.

###### v4
And Rabshakeh said to them, "Now say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: "What _is_ this confidence _in_ which you trust?

###### v5
I said, 'Only a word of lips! _War has power and a plan_!' ^[The Hebrew here is awkward; literally "Plan and power for war"] Now, in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?

###### v6
Look, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, which _if_ a man leans on it, goes into his hand and bores through it! Such _is_ Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all those who trust in him.

###### v7
And if you say to me, 'We trust in Yahweh our God,' _was it_ not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed? And he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall bow down in the _presence_ ^[Literally "face"] of this altar.'"

###### v8
And now please make a wager with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, _that is,_ if you are able _put_ ^[Literally "give"] riders for yourself on them!

###### v9
But how can you drive back _one governor among the least of my master's servants_, ^[Literally "the face of the governor of the one of the insignificant servants of my master"] when ^[Or "and"] you trust in Egypt for chariots ^[Hebrew "chariot"] and horsemen?

###### v10
And now was it without Yahweh that I have come up against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, "Go up against this land and destroy it!"'"

###### v11
And Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we can understand ^[Or "hear"] _it_, and you must not speak to us in Judean in the _hearing_ ^[Literally "ear"] of the people who _are_ on the wall."

###### v12
But ^[Or "And"] Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me to speak these words to your masters and you? _Was it_ not for the people who sit on the wall, to eat their dung and drink their urine ^[So Masoretic Hebrew text (_Kethib_); the reading tradition (_Qere_) has "feet-water"] with you?"

###### v13
Then ^[Or "And"] Rabshakeh stood and called in a great voice in Judean and said, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.

###### v14
Thus says the king: '_Do_ not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you!

###### v15
And _do_ not let Hezekiah make you rely on Yahweh, saying, "Surely Yahweh will deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!"

###### v16
You must not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: "Make a blessing ^[That is, a gesture of surrender] with me, and come out to me, and each one will eat _from_ his vine and _from_ his fig tree and drink water from ^[Or "of"] his cistern,

###### v17
until _I come_ ^[Literally "my coming"] and take you to a land like your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards,

###### v18
lest Hezekiah mislead you, saying, 'Yahweh will save us!' Did the gods of the nations each save his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?

###### v19
Where _are_ the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where _are_ the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, _have_ they delivered Samaria from my hand?

###### v20
Who _are there_ among all the gods of these countries who have saved their land from my hand, that Yahweh should save Jerusalem from my hand?"'"

###### v21
But ^[Or "And"] they were silent and did not answer him a word, for the command of the king was, "You must not answer him."

###### v22
Then ^[Or "And"] Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who _was_ over the _palace_, ^[Literally "house"] Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the reminder, came to Hezekiah _with_ torn garments and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
