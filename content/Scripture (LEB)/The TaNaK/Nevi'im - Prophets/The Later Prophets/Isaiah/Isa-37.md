Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the lands ^[The parallel text in 2 Kings has "nations"] and their land,

She shows contempt for you; she derides you, virgin daughter of Zion;
she shakes _her_ head behind you, daughter of Jerusalem.

Whom have you taunted and blasphemed,
and against whom have you raised up _your_ voice and lifted your eyes upward?
To the holy one of Israel!

###### v24
By the hand of your servants you have taunted the Lord,
and you have said, "With my many chariots, ^[Hebrew "chariot"]

_to_ the remote areas of Lebanon.
And I cut off _its tall cedars_, ^[Literally "the height of its cedars"]

And I came _to_ the height of its limit,
the forest of its orchard. ^[Or "Carmel"]

and I caused all the streams of Egypt to dry up by the sole of my feet."

###### v26
Have you not heard from _a long time ago_? ^[Literally "distant"] I have made it
from days of primeval time, and I formed it.
Now I have brought it _about_,
and it is for fortified cities to collapse into heaps of destroyed stones.

###### v27
And their inhabitants _are_ _weak_; ^[Literally "short of hand"]
they are dismayed, and they are ashamed;
they have become _like_ plants ^[Hebrew "plant"] of _the_ field,
and _like_ greens of grass,
_like_ grass on ^[Or "of"] _the_ roofs
and a cultivated field _before_ ^[Literally "before the face of"] the standing grain.

###### v28
And I know your sitting down and your going out,
and your coming in, and your raging _against_ ^[Literally "to"] me.

Because you were enraged _against_ ^[Literally "to"] me,

I will put my hook in your nose

and I will turn you back
on the way _by_ which you came.

###### v30
And this _shall be_ the sign for you: the eating of volunteer plants ^[Hebrew "plant"] this ^[Literally "the"] year, and in the second year self-seeded plants, ^[Hebrew "plant"] and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
