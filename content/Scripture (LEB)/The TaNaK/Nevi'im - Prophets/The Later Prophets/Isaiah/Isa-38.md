###### v1
In those days, Hezekiah became sick to death, and Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, came to him and said to him, "Thus says Yahweh: 'Order your house, for you _are_ about to die, and you shall not recover.'"

###### v2
Then ^[Or "And"] Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,

###### v3
and he said, "O Yahweh, please remember how ^[Or "that"] I have walked before your _presence_ ^[Literally "face"] in faithfulness with a whole heart, and I have done the good in your eyes!" And Hezekiah wept _with_ great weeping.

###### v4
Then ^[Or "And"] the word of Yahweh came ^[Or "was"] to Isaiah, saying,

###### v5
"Go and say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your ancestor: ^[Or "father"] "I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. _Look, I am going to_ ^[Literally, "Behold me; he will add," but in this context it makes better sense to change the "he" to "I"; most translations follow this emendation] add fifteen years to your days.

###### v6
And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city."'

###### v7
And this _is_ the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken:

###### v8
Look! I will cause _the_ shadow of the steps, which it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz with the sun, to turn backwards ten steps." And the sun turned back ten steps on the steps which it had gone down.

###### v9
A writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, when he was sick and had recovered from his sickness:

###### v10
I was the one who said, "I must go in the quiet of my days;
I am summoned through the gates of Sheol _for_ the rest of my years."

###### v11
I said, "I shall not see Yah! Yah in the land of the living!
I shall no more look at humankind among _the_ inhabitants of _the_ world.

###### v12
My dwelling place is pulled up and removed from me like the tent of my shepherd;
I have rolled up my life like _a_ weaver.
He cuts me off from _the_ thrum;
from day to night you bring me to an end.

###### v13
I lie down ^[Or "cry out"] until morning;
like _a_ lion, so he breaks all my bones;
from day to night you bring me to an end.

###### v14
Like a horse or a crane, so I chirp;
I moan like _a_ dove.
My eyes are weak toward the height.
Lord, I have oppression; lend me support!

###### v15
What can I say? For ^[Or "And"] he has spoken to me,
and he himself has done _it_.
I will walk slowly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.

###### v16
Lord, they live by them, and the life of my spirit belongs to all among them.
And restore me to health and keep me alive!

###### v17
Look! Bitterness was bitter to me for peace.
And you were the one who loved ^[Or possibly "kept back," which sounds similar in Hebrew] my life from _the_ pit of destruction,
for you have cast all my sins behind your back.

###### v18
For Sheol cannot praise you; death _cannot_ praise you.
Those who go down _to the_ pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.

###### v19
_The_ living, _the_ living one praises you like me today;
a father will make your faithfulness known to children.

###### v20
Yahweh, save me, and we will play my music _on_ stringed instruments all the days of our lives at the temple ^[Or "house"] of Yahweh."

###### v21
And Isaiah said, "Let them _take_ ^[Literally "lift up"] a lump of figs, and let them rub _it_ on the boil _so that_ ^[Or "and"] he may recover."

###### v22
And Hezekiah said, "What _is the_ sign that I shall go up _to_ the temple ^[Or "house"] of Yahweh?"
