for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken."

_Get yourself_ ^[Literally "Go for you"] up to a high mountain, Zion, bringer of good news!

Lift _it_ up; you must not fear!
Say to the cities of Judah, "Here _is_ your God!"

He will feed his flock like a shepherd;

###### v12
Who has measured _the_ waters in the hollow of his hand
and marked off _the_ heavens with _a_ span,
comprehended the dust of the earth in _a_ third of a measure
and weighed out _the_ mountains in the scales, ^[Hebrew "scale"] and _the_ hills in a balance?

###### v13
Who has measured up the spirit of Yahweh
or informed him _as_ _his counselor_ ^[Literally "the man of his counsel"]?

###### v14

and made _the_ way of understanding known to him?

and they are counted like dust of _the_ balances!

###### v16
And Lebanon _is_ not enough to light a fire,
and its animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] not enough for a burnt offering.

and a _goldsmith_ ^[Literally "refiner"] overlays it with gold,

and its inhabitants _are_ like grasshoppers;
the one who stretches out _the_ heavens like a veil
and spreads them out like _a_ tent to live _in_,

###### v23
the one who brings ^[Or "gives"] princes to nothing;
he makes rulers of _the_ earth like nothing.

###### v24
Indeed, hardly are they planted; indeed, hardly _are they_ sown;
indeed, hardly has their shoot taken root in the earth
when ^[Or "also"] he blows on them and they wither,
and _the_ tempest carries them like stubble.

###### v25
"And to whom you will compare me, and am I equal?" says _the_ holy one.

###### v26
Lift your eyes up _on_ high, and see! Who created these?
The one who brings out their host by number.

they shall run and not grow weary;
they shall walk and not be faint.
