###### v1
Listen to me in silence, coastlands,
and let nations renew _their_ strength.
Let them approach, then let them speak;
let us draw near together for judgment.

###### v2
Who has roused salvation from the east,
summoned ^[Or "called"] him to his foot,
gives nations _in his presence_, ^[Literally "before his face"]
and subjugates kings?
He makes ^[Or "gives"] _them_ like the dust _with_ his sword,
like scattered stubble _with_ his bow.

###### v3
He pursues them _and_ passes on _in_ peace;
he does not enter _the_ path with his feet.

###### v4
Who has accomplished and done _this_,
calling the generations from _the_ _beginning_? ^[Literally "head"]
I, Yahweh, _am_ first;
and I _am_ the one with _the_ last.

###### v5
_The_ coastlands have seen and are afraid;
the ends of the earth tremble.
They have drawn near,
and they have come.

###### v6
Each one helps ^[Hebrew "help"] his neighbor;
he says to his brother, "Take courage!"

###### v7
And _the_ artisan encourages _the_ _goldsmith_, ^[Literally "refiner"]
_the_ one who makes smooth with _the_ hammer _encourages the_ one who strikes _the_ anvil,
saying of the soldering, "It _is_ good!"
And they strengthen it with nails _so_ it cannot be knocked over.

###### v8
But ^[Or "And"] you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen,
you, the _offspring_ ^[Literally "seed"] of Abraham my _friend_, ^[Literally "beloved"]

###### v9
you whom I grasped from the ends of the earth
and called from its remotest parts
and told, "You _are_ my servant;
I have chosen you and I have not rejected you."

###### v10
You must not fear, for I _am_ with you;
you must not be afraid, for I _am_ your God.
I will strengthen you, indeed I will help you,
indeed I will take hold of you with the right hand of my salvation.

###### v11
Look! All those who are angry with you shall be ashamed and humiliated;
_your opponents_ ^[Literally "the men of your strife"] shall be like nothing and shall become lost.

###### v12
You shall seek them,
but ^[Or "and"] you shall not find them;
_your opponents_ ^[Literally "the men of your strife"] shall be like nothing,
and the men of your war like nothing.

###### v13
For I, Yahweh your God, _am_ grasping your right hand;
_it is I who say_ ^[Literally "the sayer"] to you,
"You must not fear;
I myself, I will help you.

###### v14
You must not fear, O worm of Jacob;
people of Israel,
I myself, I will help you," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and your redeemer _is_ the holy one of Israel.

###### v15
Look! I will make you into a new sharp threshing sledge,
_with_ ^[Literally "owner of"] sharp edges.
You shall thresh and crush _the_ mountains,
and you shall make _the_ hills like chaff.

###### v16
You shall winnow them and _the_ wind shall carry them,
and _the_ tempest shall scatter them.
And you yourself shall rejoice in Yahweh;
you shall boast in the holy one of Israel.

###### v17
The poor and the needy _are_ seeking water and _there is_ none;
their tongue is dried up with thirst.
I, Yahweh, will answer them;
I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.

###### v18
I will open rivers on _the_ barren heights
and fountains in _the_ midst of _the_ valleys.
I will make _the_ wilderness like a pool of water
and _the_ land of dryness like springs of water.

###### v19
I will _put_ ^[Literally "give"] _the_ cedar, acacia, myrtle, and olive oil tree in the wilderness;
I will set _the_ cypress, elm, and box tree together in the desert

###### v20
so that they may see and know,
and take to heart and understand together
that the hand of Yahweh has done this,
and the holy one of Israel has created it."

###### v21
"Present your legal case," says Yahweh.
"Bring your evidence," says the king of Jacob.

###### v22
Let them bring _them_,
and let them tell us what will happen.
Tell us what the former things _are_
_so that_ ^[Or "And"] we may take _them to_ our heart
and know their outcome. ^[Or "end"]
Declare to us the things to come;

###### v23
    tell _us_ the things coming _hereafter_, ^[Literally "later"]
that ^[Or "and"] we may know that you _are_ gods.
Indeed, do good or ^[Or "and"] do evil,
that ^[Or "and"] we may be afraid and see ^[Following the reading tradition (_Qere_); the written text (_Kethib_) has "fear"] together.

###### v24
Look! you _are_ nothing,
and your work _is_ something worthless;
whoever chooses you _is_ an abomination.

###### v25
I stirred up _one_ from _the_ north,
and he has come from _the_ rising of the sun.
He shall call on my name,
and he shall come _on_ officials as _on_ mortar,
and as _the_ _potter_ ^[Literally "creator"] treads clay.

###### v26
Who declared _it_ from _the_ _beginning_ ^[Literally "head"] _so that_ ^[Or "and"] we might know,
and _beforehand_ ^[Literally "from before faces"] _so that_ ^[Or "and"] we might say, "_He is_ _right_!" ^[Literally "righteous"]
Indeed, there was no one who declared _it_;
Indeed, there was no one who proclaimed _it_.
Indeed there was no one who heard your words.

###### v27
First to Zion, look! Look at them!
And I give a herald ^[Or "bringer"] of good tidings to Jerusalem.

###### v28
But ^[Or "And"] I look and there is no man,
and _I look_ among these and there is no counselor,
that ^[Or "and"] I might ask them and they might answer a word.

###### v29
Look! All of them _are_ deception;
their works _are_ nothing;
their images _are_ wind and emptiness.
