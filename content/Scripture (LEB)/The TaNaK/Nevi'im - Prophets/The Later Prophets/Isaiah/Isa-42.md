###### v1
Look! _here is_ my servant; I hold him,
my chosen one, _in whom_ my soul delights.
I have _put_ ^[Literally "given"] my spirit on him;
he will bring justice forth to the nations.

###### v2
He will not cry out and lift up
and make his voice heard in the street.

###### v3
He will not break a broken reed,
and he not will extinguish a dim wick.
He will bring justice forth in ^[Or "to"] faithfulness.

###### v4
He will not grow faint,
and he will not be broken
until he has established justice in the earth.
And _the_ coastlands wait for his teaching.

###### v5
Thus says the God, Yahweh,
who created the heavens
and stretched them out,
who spread out the earth and its offspring,
who gives breath to the people upon it
and spirit to those who walk in it.

###### v6
"I _am_ Yahweh; I have called you in righteousness,
and I have grasped your hand and watched over you;
and I have given you as a covenant of _the_ people,
as a light of _the_ nations,

###### v7
to open _the_ blind eyes,
to bring _the_ prisoner out from _the_ dungeon,
those who sit _in_ darkness from _the_ house of imprisonment.

###### v8
I _am_ Yahweh; that _is_ my name,
and I do not give my glory to another,
nor ^[Or "and"] my praise to the idols.

###### v9
Look! the former things have come,
and I declare new things.
I _announce_ ^[Literally "cause to hear"] _them_ to you before they sprout up."

###### v10
Sing a new song to Yahweh;
praise him from the end of the earth,
you ^[Or "those"] who go down _to_ the sea and that which fills it,
_the_ coastlands and their inhabitants.

###### v11
Let _the_ desert and its towns lift up their voice,
_the_ villages _that_ Kedar inhabits.
Let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy;
let them shout loudly from _the_ _top_ ^[Literally "head"] of _the_ mountains.

###### v12
Let them give ^[Or "establish"] glory to Yahweh
and declare his praise in the coastlands.

###### v13
Yahweh goes forth like a mighty warrior;
he stirs up zeal like a man of war.
He raises the war cry, indeed he raises the battle shout;
he prevails against his foes.

###### v14
I have been silent for a long time;
I have kept silent;
I have restrained myself like one giving birth;
I will moan, pant, and gasp together.

###### v15
I will cause mountains and hills to dry up,
and I will cause all their herbage to wither;
and I will make rivers like islands,
and I will cause pools to dry up.

###### v16
And I will lead the blind by a road they do not know;
I will cause _them_ to tread on paths they have not known.
I will make darkness _in their presence_ ^[Literally "before their face"] into light
and rough places into level ground.
These _are_ the things I will do,
and I will not forsake them.

###### v17
They shall turn back;
they shall be _greatly ashamed_, ^[Literally "ashamed with shame"]
those who trust in an image,
who say to a cast image, "You _are_ our gods."

###### v18
Deaf people, listen!
And blind people, look to see!

###### v19
Who _is_ blind but my servant
or ^[Or "and"] deaf like my messenger _whom_ I sent?
Who _is_ blind like the one who is repaid
or ^[Or "and"] blind like the servant of Yahweh?

###### v20
You see many _things_, but ^[Or "and"] you do not observe.
_His_ ears are open, but ^[Or "and"] he does not hear.

###### v21
Yahweh was willing for the sake of his righteousness;
he showed _his_ teaching to be great and proved _it_ to be glorious.

###### v22
But ^[Or "And"] this _is_ a people plundered and looted; all of them are trapped in holes,
and they are kept hidden in houses of imprisonment.
They have become like plunder, and there is no one who saves;
_like_ booty, and there is no one who says, "Restore!"

###### v23
Who among you will heed this,
will listen attentively and listen, for _the time to come_? ^[Literally "later"]

###### v24
Who gave Jacob to a plunderer ^[The reading tradition (_Qere_) has "as plunder"]
and Israel to those who plunder?
_Was it_ not Yahweh, against whom ^[Or "this"] we have sinned?
And they were not willing to walk in his ways,
and they would not _obey_ ^[Literally "hear"] his law.

###### v25
So ^[Or "and"] he poured _the_ wrath _of_ his anger upon him
and _the_ strength of war.
And it set him afire all around, but ^[Or "and"] he did not understand; ^[Or "did not know"]
and it burned him, but ^[Or "and"] he did not take _it_ to heart.
