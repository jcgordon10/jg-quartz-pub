###### v1
But now thus says Yahweh,

"You must not fear, for I have redeemed you.
I have called _you_ by your name; _you are mine_. ^[Literally "to me you"]

###### v2
When you pass through the waters, I _will be_ with you,
and through the rivers, they shall not flow over you.
When you walk through fire, you shall not be burned,
and _the_ flame shall not scorch ^[Or "burn"] you.

###### v3
For I _am_ Yahweh, your God,
the holy one of Israel, your savior.
I give you Egypt _as_ ransom,
Cush and Seba in place of you.

Because you are precious in my eyes,
you are honored, and I myself love you,
and I give people in place of you,
and nations in place of your life.

for I _am_ with you.
I will bring your _offspring_ ^[Literally "seed"] from _the_ east,
and I will gather you from _the_ west.

I will say to the north, 'Give!'
and to _the_ south, 'You must not withhold!'
Bring my sons from far away,
and my daughters from the end of the earth--

and whom I created for my glory,
whom I formed,
indeed whom I made."

###### v8
Bring out _the_ people blind yet ^[Or "and"] with eyes,

Let all the nations gather together,
and let _the_ peoples assemble.
Who among them has declared this,
and _declared_ ^[Literally "caused to hear"] _the_ former things to us?
Let them bring ^[Or "give"] their witnesses, that ^[Or "and"] they may be in the right,
and let them hear and say, "_It is_ true!"

###### v10
"You _are_ my witnesses," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and my servant whom I have chosen
so that you may know and believe _in_ ^[Literally "to"] me
and understand that I _am_ he.
No god was formed before _me_ ^[Literally "my face"],
and none shall be after me.

###### v11
I myself _am_ Yahweh,
and there is no savior besides me!

###### v12
I myself declared and saved,
and I _proclaimed_. ^[Literally "caused to hear"] And there was no _strange god_ ^[Literally "stranger"] among you.
And you _are_ my witnesses," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and I _am_ God.

###### v13
Indeed, from _this_ day I _am_ the one,
and no one can deliver from my hand.
I perform, ^[Or "make"] and who can _cancel it_?" ^[Literally "bring it back"]

###### v14
Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer,
the holy one of Israel:
"For your sake I will send _to_ Babylon,
and I will cause all of them to fall down _as_ fugitives,
and _the Chaldeans_, ^[Literally "Chaldea"] their rejoicing on the ships.

###### v15
I _am_ Yahweh, your holy one,
the creator of Israel, your king."

###### v16
Thus says Yahweh, who _makes_ ^[Literally "gives"] a way in the sea
and a path in _the_ mighty waters,

Indeed, I will _make_ ^[Literally "put"] a way in the wilderness,
rivers in _the_ desert.

###### v20
The animals of the field will honor me,
jackals and daughters of _the_ ostrich,
for I give water in the wilderness,
rivers in _the_ desert,
to give a drink _to_ my chosen people,

###### v21
    this people whom I formed for myself,
so they might _make known_ ^[Literally "count out"] my praise.

###### v22
But ^[Or "And"] you did not call me, Jacob;
for you have become weary of me, Israel.

###### v23
You have not brought me your sheep for a burnt offering
nor ^[Or "and"] honored me _with_ your sacrifice.
I have not made you serve with offerings, ^[Hebrew "offering"]
nor have I made you weary with frankincense.

###### v24
You have not bought me spice reed with money
or ^[Or "and"] satisfied me _with_ the fat of sacrifices.
But you have burdened me with your sins;
you have made me weary with your iniquities.

I, I am the one who blots out your transgressions for my sake,
and I will not remember your sins.

###### v26
Take me to court; let us enter into judgment together.
You, _make an account_ ^[Literally "count up"] so that you may be in the right.

Your first ancestor ^[Or "father"] sinned,
and your _representatives_ ^[Literally "scoffers" or "spokesmen"] transgressed against me.

And I profaned _the_ princes of _the_ sanctuary,
and I gave Jacob to destruction, and Israel to reviling.
