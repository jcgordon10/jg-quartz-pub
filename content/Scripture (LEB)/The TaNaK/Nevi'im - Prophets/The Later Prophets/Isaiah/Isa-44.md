###### v1
"But now hear, Jacob my servant,
and Israel, whom I have chosen.

###### v2
Thus says Yahweh, who made you,
and who formed you in ^[Or "from"] _the_ womb and will help you:
you must not fear, my servant Jacob,
and Jeshurun whom I have chosen.

###### v3
For I will pour out water on a thirsty _land_
and streams on dry ground.
I will pour my spirit out on your descendants ^[Hebrew "descendant"]
and my blessing on your offspring.

###### v4
And they shall sprout _among_ ^[Literally "in between"] _the_ grass
like willows by a watercourse of water.

###### v5
This _one_ will say, 'I belong to Yahweh!'
And that _one_ will be called by the name of Jacob,
and another will write _on_ his hand 'Yahweh's'
and _take the name_ ^[Literally "he will be titled by the name"] of Israel."

###### v6
Thus says Yahweh, the king of Israel,
and its redeemer, Yahweh of hosts:
"I _am the_ first, and I _am the_ last,
and there is no god besides me.

###### v7
And who _is_ like me? Let him proclaim ^[Or "call"] _it_!
And let him declare it and set it in order for me
_since I established an eternal people_ ^[Literally "from my placing a people of eternity"] and things that are to come,
and let them tell them _the things_ that are coming.

###### v8
You must not tremble, ^[Or "be startled"]
and you must not be paralyzed with fear.
Have I not made you hear from of old ^[Or "then"]
and declared _it_, and you _are_ my witnesses?
Is there a god besides me?
And there is no rock! I know none!"

###### v9
All those who form an idol _are_ nothing,
and their delightful things do not profit.
And their witnesses do not see or know,
so they will be ashamed.

###### v10
    Who would form a god
and cast an image of _which_ he cannot profit?

###### v11
Look! all his companions shall be ashamed,
and _the_ artisans _are_ human!
Let all of them assemble;
let them stand up.
They shall tremble; ^[Or "be startled"]
they shall be ashamed together.

###### v12
_The_ _ironsmith_ ^[Literally "craftsman of iron"] works in the coals _with his_ tool
and forms it with hammers.
And he makes it with _his strong arm_; ^[Literally "the arm of his strength"]
indeed, he becomes hungry, and _he lacks_ ^[Literally "there is no"] strength;
he does not drink water, and he is faint.

###### v13
_The_ _woodworker_ ^[Literally "craftsman of wood"] stretches out a line;
he makes an outline _of_ it with _a_ marker.
He makes it with _a_ knife
and makes an outline _of_ it with _a_ compass.
He makes it like _the_ image of a man,
like _the_ beauty of a human, to dwell _in_ a temple. ^[Or "house"]

###### v14
Cutting down cedars for himself,
he _chooses_ ^[Literally "takes"] a holm tree and an oak,
and he lets it grow strong for him among _the_ trees of _the_ forest.
He plants a cedar, and _the_ rain makes _it_ grow.

###### v15
And it _becomes fuel for a human_, ^[Literally "will become for a man as burning"]
and he takes some of it and grows warm;
also, he kindles a fire and bakes bread.
Also, he makes a god and bows in worship;
he makes himself an image and bows down to it!

###### v16
He burns half of it in _the_ fire;
he eats meat over half of it;
he roasts a roast and is satisfied.
Also he grows warm and says, "Ah!
I am warm! I see _the_ fire!"

###### v17
And he makes the remainder of it into a god!
He bows down to his idol,
and he bows in worship and prays to him,
and he says, "Save me, for you _are_ my god!"

###### v18
They do not know,
and they do not understand,
for their eyes _are_ besmeared _so that they cannot see_, ^[Literally "from seeing"]
their _minds_ ^[Literally "hearts"] _so that they have no insight_. ^[Literally "from having insight"]

###### v19
And _no one takes it to heart_, ^[Literally "he does not bring back to his heart"] and _there is_ no knowledge
and no understanding to say, "I burned half of it in _the_ fire
and also I baked bread on its coals;
I roasted meat, and I have eaten.
And I shall make _the_ rest of it into an abomination!
I shall bow down to a block of wood!"

###### v20
_He_ feeds _on_ ashes; a _deceived mind_ ^[Literally "heart deceived"] misleads him.
And he cannot save _himself_, ^[Literally "his soul"] and he cannot say,
"Is _this_ not an illusion in my right hand?"

###### v21
"Remember these things, Jacob,
and Israel, for you _are_ my servant:
I formed you; you _are_ my servant;
Israel, you will not be forgotten by me!

###### v22
I have wiped your transgressions out like _a_ cloud
and your sins like mist.
Return to me,
for I have redeemed you!"

###### v23
Sing for joy, heavens, for Yahweh has done _it_!
Shout, depths of _the_ earth!
Break forth, mountains, _in_ rejoicing,
forest and every tree in it,
for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob,
and he will show his glory in Israel!

###### v24
Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer,
and he who formed you in ^[Or "from"] _the_ womb:
"I _am_ Yahweh, who made everything,
who stretched out _the_ heavens alone,
who spread out the earth--who _was_ with me?--

###### v25
who frustrates ^[Or "breaks"] _the_ signs of oracle priests
and makes a fool of diviners,
who drives _the_ wise men back
and makes their knowledge foolish,

###### v26
who keeps ^[Or "erects"] the word of his servant
and carries out the plan of his messengers,
who says of Jerusalem, 'It shall be inhabited,'
and of the cities of Judah, 'They shall be rebuilt,
and I will restore its ruins';

###### v27
who says to the deep, 'Dry up!
And I will cause your rivers to dry up';

###### v28
who says of Cyrus, 'My shepherd,'
and he shall carry out all my wishes ^[Hebrew "wish"];
and saying of Jerusalem, 'It shall be rebuilt,'
and _the_ temple, 'It shall be founded.'"
