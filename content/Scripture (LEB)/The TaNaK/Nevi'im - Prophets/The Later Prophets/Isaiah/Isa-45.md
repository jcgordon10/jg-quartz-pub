###### v1
Thus says Yahweh to his anointed one,
to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped
to subjugate nations before him,
and I uncover ^[Or "let loose"] _the_ loins of kings
to open doors before him,
and _the_ gates shall not be shut:

###### v2
"I myself will go before you,
and I will level _the_ _mountains_. ^[Literally "swells"]
I will break _the_ doors of bronze
and cut through_the_ bars of iron.

###### v3
And I will give you _the_ treasures of darkness
and treasures of secret places
so that you may know that I _am_ Yahweh,
the one who calls _you_ by your name, the God of Israel,

###### v4
for the sake of my servant Jacob,
and Israel my chosen one.
And I call you by your name;
I give you a name of honor, though ^[Or "and"] you do not know me.

###### v5
I _am_ Yahweh, and there is none besides _me_;
besides me there is no god.
I gird you though ^[Or "and"] you do not know me,

###### v6
so that they may know from _the_ rising of _the_ sun
and from _the_ west that _there is_ none besides me;
I _am_ Yahweh and there is none besides _me_.

###### v7
_I_ form light and _I_ create darkness;
_I_ make peace and _I_ create evil;
I _am_ Yahweh; _I_ do all these _things_.

###### v8
Trickle, O heavens, from above,
and let clouds trickle _with_ righteousness;
let _the_ earth open so that ^[Or "and"] salvation may be fruitful,
and let it cause righteousness to sprout along with it. ^[Or "together"]
I myself, Yahweh, have created it.

###### v9
Woe _to the_ one who strives with his _maker_, ^[Literally "one who forms"]
a potsherd among ^[Or "with"] potsherds of earth!
Does _the_ clay say to the one who fashions it,
'What are you making?'
and 'Your work has no hands'?

###### v10
Woe _to the_ one who says to a father, 'What you are begetting?'
or ^[Or "and"] to a woman, '_With_ what are you in labor?'"

###### v11
Thus says Yahweh, the holy one of Israel,
and its _maker_: ^[Literally "one who forms"]
"Ask me of the things to come _about_ ^[Literally "over"] my children,
and you command me about the work of my hands.

###### v12
I myself made _the_ earth,
and I created humankind upon it.
I, my hands, stretched out _the_ heavens,
and I commanded all their host.

###### v13
I myself have stirred him up in righteousness,
and I will make all his paths smooth.
He himself shall build my city,
and he shall set my exiles free,
not for price or a gift," says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v14
Thus says Yahweh:
"The acquisition of Egypt
and the merchandise of Cush
and the Sabeans, tall men,
shall pass over to you;
they shall be yours,
and they shall walk behind you.
They shall pass over in chains,
and they shall bow down to you;
they will pray to you:
'Surely God _is_ with you, and there is no _other_.
Besides _him_ _there is_ no God.'"

###### v15
Surely you _are_ a God who keeps yourself hidden,
God of Israel, _the_ savior.

###### v16
All of them are ashamed and indeed humiliated;
_the_ craftsmen of idols go together in insult.

###### v17
Israel is saved by Yahweh _with_ everlasting salvation;
you shall not be ashamed,
and you shall not be humiliated _to all eternity_. ^[Literally "for eternity, forever"]

###### v18
For thus says Yahweh, _who created_ ^[Literally "creating"] the heavens,
he _is_ God, _who formed_ ^[Literally "forming"] the earth
and _who made_ ^[Literally "making"] it.
He himself established it;
he did not create it _as_ emptiness--
he formed it for inhabiting.
"I _am_ Yahweh and there is none besides _me_.

###### v19
I have spoken not in secrecy, in a place, a land, of darkness,
I have not said to the descendants of Jacob, 'Seek me _in vain_!' ^[Literally "in emptiness," as in verse [[Isa-45#v18|18]]]
I, Yahweh, _am_ speaking righteousness,
declaring uprightness.

###### v20
Assemble and come;
draw near together, survivors of the nations!
They do not know, those who carry _their wooden idols_ ^[Literally "the wood of their idol"]
and pray to a god who cannot save.

###### v21
Declare and present _your case_,
also let them consult together!
Who _made this known_ ^[Literally "caused to hear this"] from _former times_, ^[Literally "before"]
declared it from _of old_? ^[Literally "then"]
_Was it_ not I, Yahweh?
And there is no _other_ god besides _me_,
a righteous God besides me,
and no savior besides me.

###### v22
Turn to me and be saved, all _the_ ends of _the_ earth,
for I _am_ God and there is none besides _me_.

###### v23
I have sworn by myself;
a word that ^[Or "and"] shall not return has gone forth from my mouth _in_ righteousness:
'Every knee shall kneel down to me;
every tongue shall swear.'

###### v24
'Only in Yahweh,' one shall say to me, '_are_ righteousness and strength.'
He shall come to him, and all those who were angry with him shall be ashamed.

###### v25
In Yahweh all the offspring of Israel shall be in the right,
and they shall boast."
