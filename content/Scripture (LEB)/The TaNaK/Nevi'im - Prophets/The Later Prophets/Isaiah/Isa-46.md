[[Isa-45|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-47|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Bel bows down;
Nebo _is_ stooping.
Their idols are _on_ ^[Literally "to"] animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] and _on_ ^[Literally "to"] cattle;
your _cargo_ ^[Literally "things that are carried"] is carried _as_ a burden _on_ ^[Literally "to"] weary _animals_.

###### v2
They stoop;
they bow down together.
They are not able to save _the_ burden,
but ^[Or "and"] _they themselves go_ ^[Literally "their inner self goes"] in captivity.

###### v3
"Listen to me, house of Jacob,
and all the remnant of the house of Israel
who have been carried from _the_ belly,
who have been carried from _the_ womb:

###### v4
Even ^[Or "And"] to _your_ old age I _am_ he;
even ^[Or "And"] to _your_ advanced age I myself will support _you_.
I myself have made _you_,
and I myself will carry _you_,
and I myself will support _you_,
and I will save _you_.

###### v5
To whom will you liken me,
and count as equal,
and compare with me,
as though ^[Or "and"] we were alike?

###### v6
Those who lavish gold from _the_ purse
and weigh out silver in the balance scales;
hire _a goldsmith_ ^[Literally "one who smelts"]
and he makes him a god;
they bow down,
indeed they bow in worship.

###### v7
They carry it on _their_ shoulder;
they support it and they set it _in_ its place,
and it stands in position.
It cannot be removed from its place;
even _when_ he cries out to it, it does not answer.
It does not save him from his trouble.

###### v8
Remember this and pluck up courage!
Call to _mind_, ^[Literally "heart"] _you_ transgressors!

###### v9
    Remember _the_ former things from _a long time ago_, ^[Literally "forever"]
for I _am_ God and there is none besides _me_,
God and _there is_ none like me,

###### v10
who from _the_ beginning declares _the_ end,
and from before, _things_ that have not been done,
who says, 'My plan shall stand,'
and, 'I will accomplish ^[Or "do"] all my wishes,' ^[Hebrew "wish"]

###### v11
who calls a bird of prey from _the_ east,
the man of his ^[The reading tradition (_Qere_) has "my"] plan from a country from afar.
Indeed I have spoken; indeed I will bring it _to being_.
I have formed _it_; indeed I will do it.

###### v12
Listen to me, strong of heart,
far from righteousness!

###### v13
I bring my righteousness near; _it is_ not far.
And my salvation will not delay;
and I will put ^[Or "give"] salvation in Zion,
for Israel my glory."
