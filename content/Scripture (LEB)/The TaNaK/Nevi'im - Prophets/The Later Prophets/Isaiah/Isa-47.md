[[Isa-46|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-48|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Come down and sit on _the_ dust, virgin daughter of Babylon!
Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of Chaldea!
For _they shall no longer call_ ^[Literally "you shall not add they shall call to"] you tender and delicate.

###### v2
    Take _the_ pair of mill stones and grind flour!
Uncover your veil,
strip off _your_ skirt,
uncover _your_ thigh,
pass through _the_ rivers!

###### v3
Your nakedness shall be exposed;
indeed, your shame shall become visible.
I will take vengeance
and I will not _spare_ ^[Literally "plead with"] a person.

###### v4
Our redeemer, Yahweh of hosts _is_ his name, the holy one of Israel.

###### v5
Sit silently and go into the darkness, daughter of Chaldea,
for _they shall no longer call_ ^[Literally "you shall not add they shall call to"] you mistress of kingdoms.

###### v6
I was angry with my people;
I profaned my inheritance,
and I gave them into your hand.
You did not _give_ ^[Literally "set up"] them mercy;
on _the_ aged you made your yoke very heavy.

###### v7
    And you said, "I shall be an eternal mistress forever!"
You did not set these _things_ upon your heart;
you did not remember its end.

###### v8
Therefore now hear this, luxuriant _one_ who sits ^[Or "sitting"] in security,
who says ^[Or "saying"] in her heart, "I _am_, and besides me _there is_ no one.
I shall not sit _as_ a widow,
and I shall not know _the_ loss of children."

###### v9
And these two shall come to you _in_ a moment, in one day:
_the_ loss of children and widowhood shall come on you _completely_, ^[Literally "as their fullness"]
in spite of your many sorceries,
in spite of the power of your great enchantments.

###### v10
And you felt secure in your wickedness;
you said, "_No one_ ^[Literally "none"] sees ^[Or "_is_ seeing"] me."
Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray,
and you said in your heart, "I _am_, and besides me _there is_ no one."

###### v11
And evil shall come upon you, you will not know;
it will be on the lookout for her.
And disaster shall fall upon you; you will not be able to _avert_ ^[Literally "make amends"] it.
And ruin shall come on you suddenly; you do not know.

###### v12
Stand, now, in your enchantments,
and in your many sorceries with which you have labored from your youth.
Perhaps you may be able to benefit;
perhaps you may _scare away_. ^[Literally "terrify"]

###### v13
You struggle with your many consultations; ^[Or "advice"]
let them stand, now, and save you--
those who see the stars, divide _the_ _celestial sphere_, ^[Literally "heavens," that is, for astrology]
who inform by new moons--
from _those things_ that are coming upon you.

###### v14
Look! They are like stubble;
_the_ fire burns them completely.
They cannot deliver _themselves_ ^[Literally "their lives"] from _the_ _power_ ^[Literally "hand"] of _the_ flame;
there is no coal _for warming oneself_, ^[Literally "to grow warm"]
_no_ fire before which to sit.

###### v15
So are to you _those with_ whom you have labored,
your traders from your youth.
They wander, each to his side;
there is no one who can save you.
