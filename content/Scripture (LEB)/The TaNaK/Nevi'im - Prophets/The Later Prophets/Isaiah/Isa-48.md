###### v1
Hear this, house of Jacob,
who are called by the name of Israel
and came out from the waters of Judah,
who swear by the name of Yahweh,
and _invoke_ ^[Literally "cause to remember"] the God of Israel,
_but_ not in truth
and not in righteousness.

###### v2
For they call themselves _after the holy city_, ^[Literally "from the city of the holiness"]
and they lean on the God of Israel--
Yahweh of hosts _is_ his name.

###### v3
"I declared the former things from _of old_, ^[Literally "then"]
and they went out from my mouth.
And I _announced_ ^[Literally "caused to hear"] them suddenly;
I acted, ^[Or "did"] and they came _to pass_,

###### v4
because _I know_ ^[Literally "knowing me"] that you _are_ obstinate,
and your neck an iron sinew,
and your forehead bronze.

###### v5
And I declared _them_ to you from of old;
I  _announced_ ^[Literally "caused to hear"] _them_ to you before they came _to pass_
so that you would not say, 'My idol did them,
and my image and my cast image commanded them.'

###### v6
You have heard; see it all.
And will you not declare _it_?
I _announce_ ^[Literally "cause to hear"] new things to you from this time
and hidden things that ^[Or "and"] you have not known.

###### v7
Now they are created, and not from _of old_, ^[Literally "then"]
and before today, and you have not heard them
so that you could not say, "Look! I knew them."

###### v8
Neither have you heard, nor have you known,
nor from _of old_ ^[Literally "then"] has your ear been opened.
For I knew you would deal treacherously, very treacherously,
and you _are_ called a rebel from _the_ womb.

###### v9
For the sake of my name I _refrain from_ ^[Literally "make long"] my anger,
and _for_ my praise I restrain _it_ for you
_so as_ not to cut you off.

###### v10
Look! I have refined you, but ^[Or "and"] not like ^[Or "with"] silver;
I have chosen you in _the_ furnace of misery.

###### v11
For my own sake, for my own sake I do _it_;
for why should it ^[That is, my name] be defiled?
And I will not give my glory to another."

###### v12
"Listen to me, Jacob,
and Israel, _whom I called_: ^[Literally "who was called by me"]
I _am_ he. I _am the_ first;
also I _am the_ last.

###### v13
Indeed, my hand founded _the_ earth,
and my right hand spread out _the_ heavens;
_when_ I summon ^[Or "calling"] them, they stand in position together.

###### v14
Assemble, all of you, and hear!
Who among them declared these _things_?
Yahweh loves him;
he shall perform ^[Or "do"] his wish against Babylon
and his arm _against_ _the Chaldeans_. ^[Literally "Chaldea"]

###### v15
I, I myself, I have spoken!
Indeed, I have called him.
I have brought him,
and he will be successful _in_ his way.

###### v16
Draw near to me; hear this! I have not spoken in secrecy from _the_ _beginning_; ^[Literally "head"]
from _the_ time _it came to be_, ^[Literally "_of_ becoming it"] there I _have been_;
And now the Lord Yahweh has sent me and his Spirit."

###### v17
Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer, the holy one of Israel:
"I _am_ Yahweh your God, _who teaches_ ^[Literally "teaching"] you to profit,
leads you in _the_ way you should go.

###### v18
O that you had listened attentively to my commandments!
Then ^[Or "and"] your prosperity would have been like _a_ river,
and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.

###### v19
And your offspring would have been like the sand,
and the descendants of your _body_ ^[Literally "intestines"] like its grains. ^[Hebrew "grain"]
It would not be cut off,
and its name would not be destroyed from my presence."

###### v20
Go out from Babylon!
Flee from Chaldea!
Proclaim ^[Or "announce"] _it_ with a shout ^[Or "sound"] of rejoicing; proclaim ^[Or "cause to hear"] this!
_Send it forth_ ^[Literally "Cause it to go out"] to the end of the earth;
say, "Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob!"

###### v21
And _when_ he led them through the deserts, they were not thirsty;
he made water flow from _the_ rock for them,
and he split _the_ rock,
and _the_ water gushed out.

###### v22
"There is no peace," says Yahweh, "for the wicked."
