###### v1
Listen to me, coastlands,
and listen attentively, peoples from far away!
Yahweh called me from _the_ womb;
from the _body_ ^[Literally "intestines"] of my mother he made my name known.

###### v2
And he _made_ ^[Literally "put"] my mouth like a sharp sword;
he hid me in the shadow of his hand,
and he _made_ ^[Literally "put"] me like an sharpened arrow;
he hid me in his quiver.

###### v3
And he said to me, "You _are_ my servant,
Israel, in whom I will show my glory."

###### v4
But ^[Or "And"] I myself said, "I have labored in ^[Or "for"] vain;
I have used up my strength for nothing and vanity!
Nevertheless, my justice _is_ with Yahweh,
and my reward _is_ with my God."

###### v5
And now Yahweh says,
who formed me from _the_ womb as a servant for him,
to bring Jacob back to him,
and that Israel might not ^[The reading tradition (_Qere_) has "to him"] be gathered,
for ^[Or "and"] I am honored in the eyes of Yahweh,
and my God has become my strength.

###### v6
And he says, "It is trivial _for you to be_ ^[Literally "from being you"] a servant for me,
to raise up the tribes of Jacob
and to bring back the preserved of Israel.
I will give you as a light _to the_ nations,
to be my salvation to the end of the earth."

###### v7
Thus says Yahweh, the redeemer of Israel, his holy one,
to the one who despises ^[A Dead Sea Scroll reads "is despised _with respect to_"] life,
to the one who abhors _the_ nation,
to _the_ slave of rulers:
"Kings shall see and stand up;
princes, and they shall bow down,
for the sake of Yahweh, who _is_ faithful,
the holy one of Israel, and he has chosen you."

###### v8
Thus says Yahweh:
"I have answered you in a time of favor,
and helped you on a day of salvation,
and watched over you,
and given you as a covenant of _the_ people,
to raise up _the_ land,
to give _the_ desolate hereditary property as an inheritance,

###### v9
saying to the _prisoners_, ^[Literally "captured ones"] "Come out!"
to those who _are_ in darkness, "Show yourselves!"
they shall feed _along_ ^[Literally "on"] _the_ ways,
and their pasturage _shall be_ on all _the_ barren heights.

###### v10
They shall not be hungry or thirsty,
and heat and sun shall not strike them,
for he who takes pity on them will lead them,
and he will guide them to springs of water.

###### v11
And I will _make_ ^[Literally "put"] all my mountains like a road,
and my highways shall lead up. ^[Or "be high"]

###### v12
Look! These shall come from afar,
And look! These from _the_ north and from _the_ west
and these from the land of Sinim."

###### v13
Sing for joy, heavens, and rejoice, earth!
Mountains must break forth _in_ rejoicing!
For Yahweh has comforted his people,
and he will take pity on his afflicted ones.

###### v14
But ^[Or "And"] Zion said, "Yahweh has forsaken me,
and the Lord has forgotten me!"

###### v15
Can a woman forget her suckling,
_refrain_ from having compassion on the child of her womb?
Indeed, these may forget,
but ^[Or "and"] I, I will not forget you!

###### v16
Look, I have inscribed you on the palms of _my_ hands;
your walls _are_ continually before me.

###### v17
Your children hasten;
your destroyers and those who laid you waste depart ^[Or "move away"] from you.

###### v18
Lift your eyes up all around and see;
all of them gather; they come to you.
_As surely as I live_, ^[Literally "Life I"]
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh,
surely you shall put on all of them like _an_ ornament,
and you shall bind them on like _a_ bride.

###### v19
Surely your sites of ruins and desolate _places_ and land of ruins, ^[Hebrew "ruin"]
surely now you will be _too cramped for your_ ^[Literally "cramped by"] inhabitants, ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"]
and those who engulfed you will be far away.

###### v20
Yet the children _born when you were bereaved_ ^[Literally "of your bereavement"] will say in your _hearing_, ^[Literally "ears"]
"The place is _too_ cramped for me;
_make room_ ^[Literally "approach"] for me so that I can dwell."

###### v21
Then ^[Or "And"] you will say in your heart,
"Who has borne me these?"
And, "I _was_ bereaved and barren,
exiled and thrust away;
so ^[Or "and"] who raised these?
Look at me! I was left alone;
_where have these come from_?" ^[Literally "these where they"]

###### v22
Thus says the Lord Yahweh:
"Look! I will lift my hand up to _the_ nations,
and I will raise my signal to _the_ peoples,
and they shall bring your sons in _their_ bosom,
and your daughters shall be carried on _their_ shoulders. ^[Hebrew "shoulder"]

###### v23
And kings shall be your _guardians_, ^[Literally "those who nurture"]
and their queens your nurses.
They shall bow down, _faces_ ^[Literally "noses"] _to the_ ground, to you,
and they will lick up the dust of your feet.
Then ^[Or "And"] you will know that I _am_ Yahweh;
those who await me shall not be ashamed.

###### v24
Can war-booty be taken from _the_ mighty?
or can a captive of a righteous ^[The Dead Sea Scroll has "violent"] _person_ be rescued?

###### v25
But thus says Yahweh:
"Indeed a captive of _the_ mighty shall be taken,
and _the_ war-booty _of_ _the_ tyrant shall be rescued,
for ^[Or "and"] I myself will dispute _with_ your opponent,
and I myself will save your children.

###### v26
And I will feed your oppressors their _own_ flesh,
and they shall be drunk _with_ their blood as _with_ wine.
Then ^[Or "And"] all flesh shall know that I _am_ Yahweh,
your savior and redeemer, the strong _one_ of Jacob."
