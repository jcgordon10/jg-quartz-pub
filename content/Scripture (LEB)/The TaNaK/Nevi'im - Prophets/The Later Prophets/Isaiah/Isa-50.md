###### v1
Thus says Yahweh:
"Where _is_ this divorce document of your mother's divorce, _with_ which I dismissed her?
or to whom of my creditors did I sell you?
Look! you were sold because of your sin,
and your mother was dismissed because of your transgressions.

###### v2
Why was there no man when I came,
no one who answered when I called?
_Do I lack the strength to save_? ^[Literally "short is short my hand from redemption"]
Or _is there_ no power in me to deliver?
Look! by my rebuke I dry up _the_ sea;
I _make_ ^[Literally "put"] _the_ rivers a desert;
their fish stink because there is no water,
and they ^[Hebrew "she"] die because of thirst.

###### v3
I clothe _the_ heavens _with_ darkness,
and I _make_ ^[Literally "put"] their covering sackcloth."

###### v4
The Lord Yahweh has given me _the_ tongue of _a_ pupil,
to know how to help _the_ weary _with_ a word.
He awakens _morning by morning_, ^[Literally "in the morning in the morning"]
awakens an ear for me to listen as _do_ the pupils.

###### v5
The Lord Yahweh has opened an ear for me,
and I, I was not rebellious.
I did not turn backwards;

###### v6
    I gave my back to those who struck _me_,
and my cheeks to those who pulled out my _beard_; ^[Literally "face"]
I did not hide my face from insults and spittle.

###### v7
And the Lord Yahweh helps me,
therefore I have not been put to shame;
therefore I have set my face like flint.
And I know that I shall not be ashamed;

###### v8
    he who obtains rights for me _is_ near.
Who will contend with me? Let us stand together.
Who _is_ the master of my judgment? Let him approach me.

###### v9
Look! The Lord Yahweh helps me.
Who is the one who will declare me guilty?
Look! All of them will be worn out like a garment;
_the_ moth will eat them.

###### v10
Who among you _is_ in fear of Yahweh,
obeys ^[Or "listens"] the voice of his servant?
Who walks _in_ darkness
and has no light,
trusts in the name of Yahweh
and depends on his God?

###### v11
Look! All of you _are_ kindlers of fire,
who gird yourselves with flaming arrows.
Walk in the light of your fire,
and among _the_ flaming arrows you have kindled!
You shall have this from my hand:
you shall lie down in ^[Or "to"] a place of torment.
