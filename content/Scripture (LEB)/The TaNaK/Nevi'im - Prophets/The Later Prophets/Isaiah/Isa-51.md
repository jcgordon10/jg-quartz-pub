###### v1
"Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness,
who seek Yahweh.
Look to _the_ rock _from which_ you were hewn,
and to _the_ excavation of _the_ pit _from which_ you were quarried.

###### v2
Look to Abraham your father,
and to Sarah; she brought you forth.
For I called him _alone_, ^[Literally "one"]
but ^[Or "and"] I blessed him and made him numerous."

###### v3
For Yahweh will comfort Zion;
he will comfort all its sites of ruins.
And he will _make_ ^[Literally "put"] its wilderness like Eden,
and its desert like the garden of Yahweh.
Joy and gladness will be found in it,
thanksgiving and _the_ _sound_ ^[Literally "voice"] of song.

###### v4
"Listen attentively to me, my people,
and my nation, listen to me!
For a teaching will go out from me,
and I will cause my justice to rest for a light to _the_ peoples.

###### v5
My righteousness _is_ near; my salvation has gone out,
and my arms will judge _the_ peoples.
_The_ coastlands wait for me,
and for my arm they wait.

###### v6
Lift up your eyes to the heavens
and look to the earth beneath,
for _the_ heavens will be torn to pieces like smoke,
and the earth will be worn out like _a_ garment,
and those who inhabit her will die like gnats.
But ^[Or "And"] my salvation will be forever,
and my righteousness will not be broken to pieces.

###### v7
Listen to me, you who know righteousness,
people _who have_ my teaching in their heart;
you must not fear _the_ reproach of men,
or be terrified because of their abuse.

###### v8
For a moth will eat them like garments;
a moth will devour ^[Or "eat"] them like wool,
but ^[Or "and"] my righteousness will be forever,
and my salvation for _generation after generation_. ^[Literally "generation of generations"]"

###### v9
Awake! Awake; put on strength, O arm of Yahweh!
Awake as _in_ days of long ago,
_the_ generations of a long time back!
_Are_ you not the one who cut Rahab in pieces,
_the_ one who pierced _the_ sea-dragon?

###### v10
Are you not the one who dried up _the_ sea,
_the_ waters of _the_ great deep,
the one who _made_ ^[Literally "placed"] _the_ depths of _the_ sea a way
for those who are redeemed to cross over?

###### v11
So ^[Or "And"] the redeemed ones of Yahweh shall return,
and they shall come _to_ Zion with singing,
and everlasting joy _shall be_ on their heads. ^[Hebrew "head"]
Joy and gladness shall _appear_; ^[Literally "reach"]
sorrow and sighing shall flee away!

###### v12
"I, I _am_ he who comforts you;
who _are_ you that ^[Or "and"] you are afraid of man? He dies!
And of _the_ son of humankind? He is _sacrificed_ ^[Literally "given"] _as_ grass!

###### v13
And you have forgotten Yahweh, your maker,
who stretched out _the_ heavens,
and founded _the_ earth.
And you tremble continually, all day,
because of the wrath of the oppressor
when he _takes aim_ ^[Literally "sets up"] to destroy.
But ^[Or "And"] where _is_ the wrath of the oppressor?

###### v14
    _The_ fettered one shall make haste to be freed.
And he shall not die in ^[Or "to"] the pit,
and he shall not lack his bread.

###### v15
For ^[Or "And"] I _am_ Yahweh, your God,
who stirs up ^[Or "stirring up"] the sea, _so that_ ^[Or "and"] its waves roar;
Yahweh of hosts _is_ his name.

###### v16
And I have put my words in your mouth,
and I have covered you in the shadow of my hand,
to plant _the_ heavens
and to found _the_ earth,
saying to Zion, 'You _are_ my people.'"

###### v17
Rouse yourself! Rouse yourself!
Stand up, Jerusalem, who have drunk from the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath;
you have drunk the goblet, the cup of staggering;
you have drained _it_ out.

###### v18
There is no one who guides her among ^[Or "from"] all _the_ children she has borne,
and there is no one who grasps her by the hand among ^[Or "from"] all _the_ children she raised.

###### v19
Two _things_ here _have_ happened to you--who will _show sympathy_ ^[Literally "wander"] for you?--
devastation and destruction, famine and sword--who will comfort you?

###### v20
Your children have fainted;
they lie at _the_ head of all _the_ streets, like an antelope in ^[Or "of"] a snare,
those who are full _of_ the wrath of Yahweh,
the rebuke of your God.

###### v21
Therefore hear now this afflicted _one_
and drunken _one_ but ^[Or "and"] not from wine.

###### v22
Thus says your Lord, Yahweh,
and your God pleads the cause _of_ his people:
"Look! I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering.
You shall not _continue_ ^[Literally "do again"] to drink the goblet, the cup of my wrath, any longer.

###### v23
And I will put it in the hand of your tormenters,
who have said to _you_, ^[Literally "your inner self"] 'Bow down that ^[Or "and"] we may _pass_ ^[Or "stride"] over _you_!'
And you have _made_ ^[Literally "placed"] your back like the ground,
and like the street for those who _pass_ ^[Or "stride"] over _you_."
