###### v1
Awake! Awake; put on your strength, Zion!
Put on the garments of your beauty, Jerusalem, _holy city_! ^[Literally "city of _the_ holiness"]
For _the_ uncircumcised and _the_ unclean shall not _continue to_ ^[Literally "do again he shall"] enter you any longer.

###### v2
Shake yourself free from _the_ dust! Rise up; sit, Jerusalem!
Free yourselves _from_ the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion!

###### v3
For thus says Yahweh:
"You were sold for nothing,
and you shall be redeemed without money."

###### v4
For thus says the Lord Yahweh:
"My people went down _to_ Egypt in the beginning, to dwell as aliens there, and Assyria oppressed him _without cause_. ^[Literally "in nothing"]

###### v5
And now what do I have here?"_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh, "for my people is taken without cause. Its rulers howl," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh--"and my name _is_ reviled continually, all day.

###### v6
Therefore my people shall know my name, therefore in that day, that I _am_ the one who speaks. _Here am I_." ^[Literally "Look at me"]

###### v7
How delightful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news,
who announces peace, who brings good news, who announces salvation,
who says to Zion, "Your God reigns as a king."

###### v8
The voices ^[Hebrew "voice"] of your watchmen! They lift up _their_ voices; ^[Hebrew "voice"]
together they sing for joy;
for they _clearly_ ^[Literally "eye in eye "] see Yahweh's return _to_ Zion.

###### v9
Break forth,
sing for joy together, ruins of Jerusalem,
for Yahweh has comforted his people;
he has redeemed Jerusalem.

###### v10
Yahweh has bared _his holy arm_ ^[Literally "the arm of his holiness"] to the eyes of all the nations,
and all _the_ ends ^[Hebrew "end"] of _the_ earth shall see the salvation of our God.

###### v11
Depart, depart, go out from there! You must not touch any unclean thing.
Go out from the midst of it, keep clean, you who carry the vessels of Yahweh.

###### v12
For you shall not go out in haste,
and you shall not go in flight,
for Yahweh _is_ going before you,
and your rear guard _is_ the God of Israel.

###### v13
Look, my servant shall achieve success;
he shall be exalted,
and he shall be lifted up,
and he shall be very high.

###### v14
Just as many were appalled at you--
such _was_ his appearance beyond human disfigurement,
and his form beyond the sons of mankind--

###### v15
so he shall sprinkle many nations;
because of him, kings shall shut their mouths. ^[Hebrew "mouth"]
For they shall see what has not been told them,
and they shall consider with full attention what they have not heard.
