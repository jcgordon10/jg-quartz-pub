###### v1
Who has believed our message,
and to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?

###### v2
For ^[Or "And"] he went ^[Or "grew"] up like _a_ shoot before him,
and like _a_ root from dry ground.
He had no form and no majesty that ^[Or "and"] we should see him,
and no appearance that ^[Or "and"] we should take pleasure in him.

###### v3
_He was_ despised and rejected _by_ men,
a man of suffering, and acquainted with ^[Or "knowledgeable of"] sickness,
and like _one from whom others hide their faces_, ^[Literally "hiding of face from him"] _he was_ despised,
and we did not hold him in high regard.

###### v4
However, he was the one who lifted up our sicknesses,
and he carried our pain,
yet ^[Or "and"] we ourselves assumed him stricken,
struck down _by_ God and afflicted.

###### v5
But ^[Or "And"] he _was_ pierced ^[Or "wounded"] because of our transgressions,
crushed because of our iniquities;
the chastisement for ^[Or "of"] our peace ^[Or "healing"] _was_ upon him,
and by his wounds ^[Hebrew "wound"] _we were healed_. ^[Literally "it was healed for us"]

###### v6
All of us have wandered about like sheep;
we each have turned to his own way;
and Yahweh let fall on him
the iniquity of us all.

###### v7
He was oppressed and afflicted,
yet ^[Or "and"] he did not open his mouth;
he was brought like _a_ lamb to _the_ slaughter,
and like a sheep is dumb before its shearers,
so ^[Or "and"] he did not open his mouth.

###### v8
He was taken by restraint of justice,
and who concerned himself with his generation?
For he was cut off from the land of _the_ living;
he _received a_ blow because of the transgression of my people.

###### v9
He made ^[Or "gave"] his grave with _the_ wicked,
and with _the_ rich in his death,
although he had done no violence,
and _there was_ no deceit in his mouth.

###### v10
Yet ^[Or "And"] Yahweh was pleased to crush him;
he _made him sick_. ^[Literally "he made sick"]
If she ^[Or "you"] places ^[Or "makes"] his life a guilt offering, ^[Or "compensation"]
he will see offspring.
He will prolong days,
and the will of Yahweh will succeed in his hand.

###### v11
From the trouble of his life ^[Or "soul"] he will see; ^[Dead Sea Scrolls add "light"]
he will be satisfied.
In his knowledge, _the_ righteous _one_, my servant, shall declare many righteous, ^[Or "right"]
and he is the one who will bear their iniquities.

###### v12
Therefore, I will divide to him _a portion_ among the many, ^[Or "great"]
and with _the_ strong ones he will divide bounty,
_because_ ^[Literally "Instead of that"] he poured his life out to death
and was counted with _the_ transgressors;
and ^[Or "yet"] he was the one who bore the sin of many
and will intercede for the transgressors.
