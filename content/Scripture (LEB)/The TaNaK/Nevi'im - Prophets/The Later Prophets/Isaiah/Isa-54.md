###### v1
"Sing for joy, barren _woman_; _who_ has not borne!
Burst forth _into_ rejoicing and rejoice, _she who_ has not been in labor!
For _the_ children of _the_ desolate woman _are_ more than _the_ children of _the_ married woman," says Yahweh.

###### v2
"Enlarge the site of your tent,
and let them stretch out the tent curtains of your dwelling place.
You must not spare; make your tent cords long
and strengthen your pegs,

###### v3
        for you will spread out _to the_ right and _to the_ left.
And your descendants ^[Hebrew "descendant"] will be heir _to the_ nations,
and they will inhabit desolate towns.

###### v4
You must not fear, for you will not be ashamed,
and you must not be confounded, for you will not feel abashed,
for you will forget the shame of your youth,
and you will no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood.

###### v5
For your husband ^[The Hebrew is plural] _is_ your maker, ^[The Hebrew is plural] his name _is_ Yahweh of hosts;
and your redeemer _is_ the holy one of Israel, he is called the God of all of the earth.

###### v6
For Yahweh has called you like a wife forsaken and hurt of spirit,
like ^[Or "and"] _the_ wife of childhood when she is rejected, says your God.

###### v7
I abandoned you _for a short_ ^[Literally "in a small"] moment,
but ^[Or "and"] I will gather you with great compassion.

###### v8
I hid my face from you _for_ a moment, in the flowing of anger,
but ^[Or "and"] I will have compassion on you with everlasting faithfulness" says your redeemer, Yahweh.

###### v9
"For this _is like_ the waters of Noah to me,
when I swore _that the waters of Noah would never again pass_ ^[Literally "from the passing over of the waters of Noah again"] over the earth,
so I swore _that I would not be_ ^[Literally "from being "] angry at you and rebuke you.

###### v10
For the mountains may depart,
and the hills may sway,
but ^[Or "and"] my faithfulness shall not depart from you,
and my covenant of peace shall not sway,"
says Yahweh, who has compassion on you,

###### v11
    "O afflicted _one_, driven away, _who_ is not consoled.
Look! I _am_ about to set your stones in hard mortar,
and I will lay your foundation with sapphires.

###### v12
And I will _make_ ^[Literally "place"] your battlements of ruby,
and your gates of stones of beryl,
and all your wall of precious stones.

###### v13
And all your children _shall be_ pupils of Yahweh,
and the peace of your children _shall be_ great.

###### v14
In righteousness you shall be established.
Be far from oppression, for you shall not fear,
and from terror, for it shall not come near you.

###### v15
If indeed one attacks, _it is_ not from me;
whoever attacks you shall fall because of you.

###### v16
Look! I myself have created _the_ craftsman who blows ^[Or "blowing"] _the_ fire _of_ coals,
and who produces ^[Or "producing"] a weapon for his work;
also ^[Or "and"] I myself have created _the_ destroyer to destroy.

###### v17
Every weapon formed against you shall not succeed,
and you shall declare guilty every tongue _that_ rises against you for judgment.
This _is_ the inheritance of the servants of Yahweh,
and their _legal right_ ^[Literally "justice"] from me,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh.
