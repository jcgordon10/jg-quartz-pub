###### v1
"Ho! Everyone thirsty, come to the waters!
And whoever has no money, come, buy and eat,
and come, buy without money,
wine and milk without price!

###### v2
Why do you weigh out money for _what is_ not food,
and your labor for _what cannot satisfy_? ^[Literally "_what is_ not for satiation"]
Listen carefully to me, and eat _what is_ good,
and let your soul take pleasure in _rich_ ^[Literally "fatty"] food.

###### v3
Extend your ear, and come to me!
Listen so that ^[Or "and"] your soul may live,
and I will _make_ ^[Literally "cut"] an everlasting covenant with ^[or "for"] you,
the enduring proofs of _the mercies shown to_ ^[Literally "mercy of"] David.

###### v4
Look! I made ^[Or "gave"] him a witness to _the_ peoples,
a leader and a commander _for the_ peoples.

###### v5
Look! You shall call a nation _that_ you do not know,
and a nation _that_ does not know you shall run to you,
because of Yahweh your God,
and the holy one of Israel, for he has glorified you."

###### v6
Seek Yahweh _while he lets himself be found_; ^[Literally "in his letting himself be found"]
call him _while he is_ ^[Literally "in his being"] near.

###### v7
Let _the_ wicked forsake his way,
and _the_ man of sin his thoughts.
And let him return to Yahweh, that ^[Or "and"] he may take pity on him,
and to our God, for he will _forgive manifold_. ^[Literally "make numerous to"]

###### v8
"For my thoughts _are_ not your thoughts,
and your ways _are_ not my ways,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v9
"For _as_ _the_ heavens are _higher_ ^[Literally "high"] than _the_ earth,
so my ways are _higher_ ^[Literally "high"] than your ways,
and my thoughts than your thoughts.

###### v10
For just as the rain and the snow come down from heaven,
and they do not return there
except they have watered the earth thoroughly
and cause it to bring forth and sprout,
and give seed to the sower
and bread to the eater,

###### v11
so shall be my word that goes out from my mouth.
It shall not return to me without success,
but shall accomplish ^[Or "do"] what I desire
and be successful _in the thing for_ which I sent it.

###### v12
For you shall go out in joy,
and you shall be led in peace.
The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you, rejoicing
and all the trees of the field shall clap hands. ^[Hebrew "hand"]

###### v13
Instead of the thorn bush, _the_ juniper shall go up;
instead of the brier, _the_ myrtle shall go up,
and it shall serve as a memorial to Yahweh,
for an everlasting sign _that_ shall not be cut off."
