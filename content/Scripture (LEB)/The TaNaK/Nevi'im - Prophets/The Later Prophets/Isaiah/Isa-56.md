###### v1
Thus says Yahweh:
"Observe justice
and do righteousness,
for my salvation _is_ close to coming,
and my justice to being revealed.

###### v2
Happy _is the_ man _who_ does this,
and _the_ son of humankind _who_ keeps hold of it,
who keeps _the_ Sabbath _so as not to profane_ ^[Literally "from profaning"] it,
and who keeps his hand from doing any ^[Or "all"] evil."

###### v3
And do not let the _foreigner_ ^[Literally "son of the foreign country"] _who_ joins himself to Yahweh say, "Surely Yahweh will separate me from his people."
And do not let the eunuch say, "Look! I _am_ a dry tree!"

###### v4
For thus says Yahweh, "To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,
and choose that in which I delight,
and who keep hold of my covenant.

###### v5
And I will give them a monument and a name in my house and within my walls,
better than sons and daughters;
I will give him an everlasting name
that shall not be cut off.

###### v6
And the _foreigners_ ^[Literally "sons of the foreign country"] _who_ join themselves to Yahweh to serve him
and to love the name of Yahweh, to become his servants,
every one who keeps _the_ Sabbath, _so as not to profane_ ^[Literally "from profaning"] it,
and those who keep hold of my covenant,

###### v7
I will bring them to _my holy mountain_; ^[Literally "the mountain of my holiness"]
I will make them merry in my house of prayer.
their burnt offerings and their sacrifices _will be accepted_ ^[Literally "for acceptance"] on my altar,
for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples,"

###### v8
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh, who gathers ^[Or "gathering"] the scattered ones of Israel (still I will gather to ^[Or "upon"] him, to his gathered ones).

###### v9
All wild animals _in the_ field, come,
to devour, ^[Or "eat"] all wild animals in the forest!

###### v10
His watchmen _are_ blind,
none of them know.
They _are_ all dumb dogs;
they are unable to bark,
panting, lying down,
loving to slumber.

###### v11
And the dogs _have a greedy appetite_; ^[Literally "are strong of soul"]
they _are never satisfied_. ^[Literally "do not know satiation"]
And they are _the_ shepherds!
They do not have ^[Or "know"] understanding.
They all turn to their _own_ way,
each one for his _own_ gain, _every one of them_. ^[Literally "from his end "]

###### v12
"Come, let me take wine,
and let us carouse _with_ intoxicating drink,
and tomorrow will be like today,
_very great indeed_." ^[Literally "excessively"]
