[[Isa-56|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-58|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
The righteous _one_ perishes, and there is no one who takes ^[Or "sets"] _it_ to heart.
And men of faithfulness _are_ gathered, while there is no one who understands,
for the righteous is gathered from the presence of wickedness.

###### v2
    he enters _into_ peace;
they will rest on their beds,
walking straight ahead of him.

###### v3
"But ^[Or "And"] you, come near here, you children of a soothsayer,
offspring _of_ an adulterer and she _who_ commits fornication.

###### v4
At whom do you make fun?
At whom do you _open_ ^[Literally "widen"] _your_ mouth _and_ _stick out_ ^[Literally "make long"] _your_ tongue?
_Are_ you not children of transgression,
offspring of deception,

###### v5
who burn with lust among the oaks,
under every leafy tree,
who slaughter children in the valleys,
under the clefts of the rocks?

###### v6
Your portion _is_ among _the_ smooth _stones_ of _the_ valley;
they, they _are_ your lot;
indeed, to them you have poured out a drink offering,
you have brought a food offering.
Shall I relent concerning these _things_?

###### v7
You have set your bed upon a high and lofty mountain;
indeed, you went up there to slaughter sacrifice.

###### v8
And you have set your symbol behind the door and the doorpost;
for you depart ^[The reading tradition (_Qere_) has "uncover," which makes no sense in context, but with different vowels it would be "depart"] from me, and you go up;
you make your bed wide, and you _make a deal with_ ^[Literally "cut off for yourself from"] them,
you have loved their bed; you have seen _their_ _genitals_. ^[Literally "hand"]

###### v9
And you climbed down to the king with oil,
and you made your perfumes numerous,
and you sent your envoys _far away_, ^[Literally "to from far"]
and you _sent down deep_ ^[Literally "humiliated"] to Sheol.

###### v10
You grow weary by the greatness of your way,
_but_ you did not say, 'Despairing!'
You found the _renewal_ ^[Literally "life"] of your _strength_, ^[Literally "hand;" compare the "hand" in verse [[Isa-57#v8|8]]]
therefore you do not grow weak.

###### v11
And of whom were you afraid and feared, that you deceived
and did not remember me?
Did you not place _it_ on your heart?
_Have_ I not been silent, even from long ago,
and _so_ you do not fear me?

###### v12
I myself will declare your righteousness and your works,
but ^[Or "and"] they will not benefit you.

###### v13
When _you cry_, ^[Literally "your crying"] let your collection deliver you,
and _the_ wind will carry all of them away;
a breath will take _them_ away.
But ^[Or "And"] he who takes refuge in me shall take possession _of_ _the_ land,
and he shall inherit my _holy mountain_." ^[Literally "mountain of holiness "]

###### v14
And one shall say, "Build up, build up! Clear _the_ way!
Remove _the_ obstacles ^[Hebrew "obstacle"] from the way of my people!"

###### v15
For thus says _the_ high and lofty one who resides forever, and _whose_ name _is_ holy:
"I reside _in_ a high and holy place,
and with _the_ _contrite_ ^[Literally "crushed"] and humble of spirit,
to revive _the_ spirit of _the_ humble,
and to revive _the_ heart of _the_ _contrite_. ^[Literally "crushed"]

###### v16
For I will not attack forever,
and I will not be angry forever,
for _the_ spirit will grow faint before me,
and _the_ breaths _that_ I myself I have made.

###### v17
I was angry because of his sin of gain, and I struck him;
I hid and I was angry, but ^[Or "and"] he walked apostate, in the ways ^[Hebrew "way"] of his heart.

###### v18
I have seen his ways, but ^[Or "and"] I will heal him;
and I will lead him and give him and his mourners comfort as a recompense,

###### v19
    creating fruit of lips.
Peace, peace to the far and near," says Yahweh, "and I will heal him.

###### v20
But ^[Or "And"] the wicked _are_ like the churning sea,
that is not able to keep quiet,
and its waters toss up mire and mud.

###### v21
There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked."
