[[Isa-57|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-59|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
"Call with _the_ throat; you must not keep back!
lift up your voice like _a_ trumpet,
and declare ^[Or "announce"] to my people their rebellion,
and to the house of Jacob their sins.

###### v2
Yet ^[Or "And"] they seek me day _by_ day,
and they desire the knowledge of my ways
like a nation that _practiced_ ^[Literally "did"] righteousness,
and had not forsaken the judgment of its God;
they ask me for _righteous judgments_, ^[Literally "judgments of righteousness"]
they desire the closeness of God.

###### v3
'Why do we fast, and you do not see _it_?
We humiliate our soul, and you do not notice _it_?'
Look! You find delight on the day of your fast,
and you oppress all your workers!

###### v4
Look! You fast to quarrel and strife,
and to strike with a _wicked fist_. ^[Literally "fist of wickedness"]
You shall not fast as _you do_ _today_, ^[Literally "the day"]
to _make your voice heard_ ^[Literally "cause to hear your voice"] on the height.

###### v5
Is _the_ fast I choose like this,
a day for humankind to humiliate _himself_ ^[Literally "his soul"]?
To bow his head like a reed,
and _make_ ^[Literally "he makes"] his bed _on_ sackcloth and ashes;
you call this a fast
and a day of pleasure to Yahweh?

###### v6
Is this not _the_ fast I choose: to release _the_ bonds of injustice,
to untie _the_ ropes of _the_ yoke,
and to let _the_ oppressed go free,
and _tear_ ^[Literally "you must tear"] every yoke to pieces?

###### v7
_Is it_ not to break your bread for the hungry?
You must bring _home_ ^[Literally "a house"] _the_ poor, _the_ homeless.
When you see _the_ naked, you must cover him,
and you must not hide yourself from your _relatives_. ^[Literally "flesh"]

###### v8
Then your light shall break forth like the dawn,
and your healing shall grow quickly.
And your salvation shall go before you;
the glory of Yahweh will be your rear guard.

###### v9
Then you shall call, and Yahweh himself will answer.
You shall cry for help, and he will say, 'Here I _am_!'
If you remove from among you _the_ yoke,
the _finger-pointing_ ^[Literally "stretching out of _the_ finger"] and _evil speech_, ^[Literally "the speaking of evil"]

###### v10
if ^[Or "and"] you offer your soul to the hungry,
and you satisfy _the_ appetite of _the_ afflicted,
then ^[Or "and"] your light shall rise in the darkness,
and your darkness _will be_ like noon.

###### v11
And Yahweh will lead you continually, and satisfy your soul in a barren land,
and he will strengthen your bones,
and you shall be like a well-watered garden,
and like a spring of water whose water does not fail.

###### v12
And they shall rebuild ancient ruins from you;
you shall erect _the_ foundations of _many generations,_ ^[Literally "generation and generation"]
and _you shall be called_ ^[Literally "shall be called to you"] _the_ bricklayer _of_ _the_ breach,
_the_ restorer of paths to live _in_.

###### v13
If you hold your foot back from _the_ Sabbath,
_from_ doing your affairs on _my holy day_, ^[Literally "the day of my holiness"]
if ^[Or "and"] you call the Sabbath a pleasure,
the holy _day_ of Yahweh honorable,
if ^[Literally "and"] you honor him _more than_ ^[Literally "from"] doing your ways,
than finding your affairs ^[Hebrew "affair"] and speaking a word,

###### v14
then you shall take your pleasure in ^[Or "on"] Yahweh,
and I will make you ride upon _the_ heights of _the_ earth,
and I will feed you the heritage of Jacob your ancestor, ^[Or "father"]
for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken."
