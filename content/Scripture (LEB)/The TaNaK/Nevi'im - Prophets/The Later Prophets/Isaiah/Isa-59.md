###### v1
Look! The hand of Yahweh is not too short _to save_, ^[Literally "from saving"]
and his ear is not _too_ dull _to hear_. ^[Literally "from hearing"]

###### v2
Rather, your iniquities have been _barriers_ ^[Literally "dividers"] between you and your God,
and your sins have hidden _his_ face from you, from hearing.

###### v3
For your hands are defiled with blood,
and your fingers with iniquity.
Your lips have spoken lies,
your tongue speaks wickedness.

###### v4
There is nobody _who pleads with_ ^[Literally "calling in"] justice,
and there is nobody who judges with honesty.
They rely on nothing
and speak vanity.
They conceive trouble
and beget iniquity;

###### v5
they hatch viper eggs,
and they weave a spider web.
One who eats their eggs dies,
and that which is pressed is hatched _as_ a serpent.

###### v6
Their webs cannot become clothing,
and they cannot cover themselves with their works.
Their works _are_ works of iniquity,
and deeds ^[Hebrew "deed"] of violence _are_ in their hands.

###### v7
Their feet run to evil,
and they hasten to shed innocent blood.
Their thoughts _are_ thoughts of iniquity;
devastation and destruction _are_ in their highways.

###### v8
They do not know _the_ way of peace,
and there is no justice in their firm paths.
They have made their paths crooked for themselves;
everyone _who walks_ ^[Literally "walking"] in it knows no peace.

###### v9
Therefore justice is far from us,
and righteousness does not reach us.
We wait for light, but ^[Or "and"] look! _there is_ darkness;
for brightness, _but_ we walk in darkness.

###### v10
We grope like the blind _along_ a wall,
and we grope _as without_ ^[Literally "like there are no"] eyes.
We stumble at noon as _in_ the twilight;
among the strong _we are_ like the dead.

###### v11
We all groan like bears,
and we coo mutteringly like doves.
We wait for justice, but ^[Or "and"] there is none;
for salvation, _but_ it is far from us.

###### v12
For our transgressions are numerous before you,
and our sins _testify_ ^[Or "answers"] against us.
Indeed, our transgressions _are_ with us,
and we know our iniquities:

###### v13
transgressing and denying Yahweh,
and turning _away from following_ ^[Literally "back from behind"] our God;
speaking oppression and falsehood,
conceiving and uttering words of deception from _the_ heart.

###### v14
And justice is pushed back,
and righteousness stands afar;
for truth stumbles in the public square,
and straightforwardness is unable to enter,

###### v15
and truth is missing,
and he who turns aside from evil _is_ plundered.
And Yahweh saw,
and it was displeasing in his eyes that there was no justice

###### v16
And he saw that there was no man,
and he was appalled that there was no one who intercedes,
so ^[Or "and"] his arm came to assist him,
and his righteousness _was what_ ^[Literally "it"] sustained him.

###### v17
And he put on righteousness like _a_ breastplate,
and a helmet of salvation on his head,
and he put on garments of vengeance _for_ clothing,
and he wrapped _himself in_ zeal as _in a_ robe.

###### v18
According to deeds, so he will repay;
wrath to his enemies, requital to those who are his _enemies_. ^[Literally "hostile"]
He will repay requital to the coastlands.

###### v19
So ^[Or "And"] they shall fear the name of Yahweh from _the_ west,
and his glory from the sunrise,
for he will come like _a_ narrow stream;
the wind of Yahweh drives it on.

###### v20
"And a redeemer will come to Zion,
to those in Jacob who turn away from transgression,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v21
"And as for me, this _is_ my covenant with them, says Yahweh:
my spirit that _is_ upon you,
and my words that I have placed in your mouth
shall not depart from your mouth,
or ^[Or "and"] from the mouths ^[Hebrew "mouth"] of your _children_, ^[Literally "offspring"]
or ^[Or "and"] from the mouths ^[Hebrew "mouth"] of _your children's children_," ^[Literally "the offspring of your offspring"]
says Yahweh, "from now on and forever."
