[[Isa-60|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-62|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
_The_ Spirit of the Lord Yahweh _is_ upon me,
because Yahweh has anointed me,
he has sent me to bring good news _to the_ oppressed,
to bind up _the brokenhearted_, ^[Literally "those broken of heart"]
to _proclaim_ ^[Literally "call"] release to _the_ captives
and liberation to those who are bound,

###### v2
to _proclaim_ ^[Literally "call"] _the_ year of Yahweh's favor,
and our God's day of vengeance,
to comfort all those in mourning,

###### v3
    to _give_ ^[Literally "place"] for those in mourning in Zion,
to give them a head wrap instead of ashes,
_the_ oil of joy instead of mourning,
a garment of praise instead of a faint spirit.
And _they will be called_ ^[Literally "it will be called to them"] oaks of righteousness,
the planting of Yahweh, to show his glory.

###### v4
And they shall build _the_ ancient ruins,
they shall erect _the_ former deserted _places_.
And they shall restore _the_ _devastated cities_, ^[Literally "cities of devastation"]
_the_ deserted _places_ of _many generations_. ^[Literally "generation and generation"]

###### v5
And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, ^[Hebrew "flock"]
and _foreigners_ ^[Literally "sons of a foreign country"] _shall be_ your farmers and vinedressers.

###### v6
But ^[Or "And"] you shall be called the priests of Yahweh,
_you will be called_ ^[Literally "it shall be said of you"] servers of our God.
You shall eat _the_ wealth of _the_ nations,
and you shall boast in their riches.

###### v7
Instead of your shame, a double portion,
and _instead of_ insult, they will rejoice _over_ their portion.
Therefore they will take a double portion in their land;
_they shall possess everlasting joy_. ^[Literally "possession of joy everlasting shall be for them"]

###### v8
For I, Yahweh, love justice,
hate robbery and ^[Or "in"] injustice,
and I will _faithfully_ ^[Literally "in _the_ faithfulness"] give their reward,
and I will _make_ ^[Literally "cut"] an everlasting covenant _with_ ^[Literally "to"] them.

###### v9
And their descendants ^[Hebrew "descendant"] will be known among the nations,
and their offspring in the midst of the peoples.
All those who see them shall recognize them,
that they _are_ descendants ^[Hebrew "descendant"] _whom_ Yahweh has blessed.

###### v10
I will rejoice greatly in Yahweh;
my being shall shout in exultation in my God.
For he has clothed me _with_ garments of salvation,
he has covered me _with the_ robe of righteousness,
as _a_ bridegroom adorns _himself_ _with_ a head wrap like a priest,
and as _a_ bride adorns herself _with_ her jewelry.

###### v11
For as the earth _produces_ ^[Literally "brings out"] its sprout,
and as a garden makes its plants sprout,
so the Lord Yahweh will make righteousness sprout,
and praise before all the nations.
