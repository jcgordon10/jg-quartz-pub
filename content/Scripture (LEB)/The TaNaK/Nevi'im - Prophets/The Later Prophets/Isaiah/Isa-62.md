###### v1
For the sake of Zion I will not be silent,
and for the sake of Jerusalem I will not maintain a quiet attitude,
until her righteousness goes out like the bright light,
and her salvation burns like a torch.

###### v2
And _the_ nations shall see your righteousness,
and all _the_ kings your glory,
and _you will be called_ ^[Literally "it shall be called to you"] a new name
that the mouth of Yahweh will designate.

###### v3
And you shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh,
and a headband of royalty in the hand of your God.

###### v4
It shall no longer be said of you, "Forsaken,"
and it shall no longer be said of your land, "Desolation!"
but _you will_ ^[Literally "to you it shall"] be called "My Delight _Is_ In Her,"
and your land, "Married,"
for Yahweh delights in you,
and your land shall be married.

###### v5
For _as_ a young man marries a virgin,
_so_ shall your sons marry you,
and _as is the_ joy of _the_ bridegroom over _the_ bride,
_so_ shall your God rejoice over you.

###### v6
I have appointed watchmen upon your walls, Jerusalem;
all day and all night they shall never be silent.
You who profess Yahweh have no rest.

###### v7
    And you must not give him rest until he establishes,
and until he _makes_ ^[Literally "places"] Jerusalem _an object of praise_ ^[Literally "a praise"] in the earth.

###### v8
Yahweh has sworn by his right hand,
and by _his mighty arm_, ^[Literally "the arm of his might"]
"Surely I will never again give your grain _as_ food to _your enemies_, ^[Literally "those who are hostile to you"]
and surely _foreigners_ ^[Literally "sons of a foreign country"] shall not drink your new wine at which you have labored."

###### v9
But those who gather it shall eat it, and they shall praise Yahweh,
and those who gather it shall drink it in _my holy courts_. ^[Literally "the courts of my holiness"]

###### v10
Pass through, pass through the gates!
Make the way clear _for_ ^[Literally "of"] the people!
Pile up, pile up the highway; clear _it_ of stones! ^[Hebrew "stone"]
Lift up an ensign over the peoples!

###### v11
Look! Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth:
Say to daughter Zion, "Look, your salvation _is_ coming!
Look, his reward _is_ with him,
and his reward before him.

###### v12
And they shall call them "The _Holy People_, ^[Literally "People of the Holiness"] The Redeemed Of Yahweh,"
and _you_ ^[Literally "to you it"] shall be called "Sought After, A City Is Not Forsaken."
