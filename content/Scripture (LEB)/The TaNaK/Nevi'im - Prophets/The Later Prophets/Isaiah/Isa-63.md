[[Isa-62|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-64|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Who _is_ this, coming from Edom,
from Bozrah _in_ bright red garments?
_Who is_ this honored in his garment,
lying down in his great strength?
"_It is_ I, speaking in justice,
_mighty_ ^[Literally "great"] to save!"

###### v2
Why _are_ your garments ^[Hebrew "garment"] red,
and your garments like he who treads in _the_ winepress?

###### v3
"I have trodden _the_ winepress alone,
and there was no man from _the_ peoples with me.
And I trod them in my anger,
and I trampled them in my wrath,
and spattered their juice on my garments,
and stained all my clothing,

###### v4
for _the_ day of vengeance _was_ in my heart,
and the year of my blood-vengeance has come!

###### v5
And I looked, but ^[Or "and"] there was no helper,
and I was appalled, but ^[Or "and"] there was no one who sustains,
so ^[Or "and"] my arm came to assist me,
and my wrath _was what_ ^[Literally "it"] sustained me.

###### v6
And I trampled peoples in my anger,
and I made them drunk in my wrath,
and I brought their juice down to the earth."

###### v7
I will mention the loyal love of Yahweh, the praises of Yahweh, according to all that Yahweh has done for us,
and _the_ greatness of goodness to the house of Israel that he has done to them according to his mercy and the abundance of his loyal love.

###### v8
And he said, "Surely my people _are_ children; they will not break faith." And he became a Savior to them.

###### v9
In all their distress, _there was no distress_, ^[The reading tradition (_Qere_) has "he had distress"]
and the messenger of his _presence_ ^[Literally "face"] saved them,
in his love and compassion he himself redeemed them,
and he lifted them up,
and he supported them all _the_ days of old.

###### v10
But ^[Or "And"] they _were the ones who_ ^[Literally "they"] rebelled,
and they grieved _his Holy Spirit_, ^[Literally "the spirit of his holiness"]
so ^[Or "and"] he _became an enemy to them_; ^[Literally "was changed to them to one who is hostile"]
he himself fought against them.

###### v11
Then ^[Or "And"] his people remembered the days of old, _of_ Moses.
Where _is_ the one who led up them from _the_ sea with the shepherds of his flock?
Where _is_ the one who puts _his Holy Spirit_ ^[Literally "the spirit of his holiness"] inside him,

###### v12
    _who made_ ^[Literally "bringing"] his magnificent arm move _at_ ^[Literally "to"] the right hand of Moses,
_who divided_ ^[Literally "dividing"] _the_ waters _before them_, ^[Literally "from their face"]
to make an everlasting name for himself,

###### v13
_who led_ ^[Literally "leading"] them through the depths?
They did not stumble like _a_ horse in the desert;

###### v14
like cattle in the valley _that_ goes down, the Spirit of Yahweh _gave him rest_, ^[Literally "caused to rest"]
so you lead your people to make a magnificent name for yourself.

###### v15
Look from heaven,
and see from the lofty residence of your holiness and glory.
Where _are_ your zeal and strength?
_Your compassion_ ^[Literally "The agitation of your intestines"] and mercy to me hold themselves back.

###### v16
For you _are_ our father, although Abraham does not know us,
and Israel does not acknowledge us.
You, Yahweh _are_ our father,
Our Redeemer from _of_ old _is_ your name.

###### v17
Why do you make us wander, Yahweh?
You harden our heart from your ways _so that we do not fear_ ^[Literally "from the fear of"] you.
Turn back for the sake of your servants,
the tribes of your inheritance.

###### v18
_Your holy people_ ^[Literally "The people of your holiness"] took possession for _a_ little _while_;
our adversaries have trampled down your sanctuary.

###### v19
We have been since antiquity; you did not rule them;
_they were not called by your name_. ^[Literally "your name was not called over them"]
