###### v1
 ^[[[Isa-64#v1|Isaiah 64:1]] in the English Bible begins here. In the Hebrew Bible, 63:19 continues] Would that you would tear _the_ heavens _and_ come down;
_the_ mountains would quake before you,

###### v2
 ^[[[Isa-64#v2|Isaiah 64:2–12]][[Isa-64#v3|]][[Isa-64#v4|]][[Isa-64#v5|]][[Isa-64#v6|]][[Isa-64#v7|]][[Isa-64#v8|]][[Isa-64#v9|]][[Isa-64#v10|]][[Isa-64#v11|]][[Isa-64#v12|]] in the English Bible is 64:1–11 in the Hebrew Bible] as fire kindles brushwood,
_the_ fire causes water to boil,
to make your name known to your adversaries,
_that the_ nations might tremble from your _presence_. ^[Literally "face"]

###### v3
When you did terrible deeds _which_ we did not _expect_, ^[Literally "await"] you came down;
_the_ mountains quaked because of your _presence_. ^[Literally "face"]

###### v4
And since ancient _times_ they have not heard,
have not listened,
no eye has seen a God except you;
he _acts_ ^[Literally "makes"] for the one who waits for him.

###### v5
You meet with the one who rejoices,
one who does righteousness.
In your ways they remember you.
Look! You were angry and we sinned against them _in_ ancient _times_ and we were saved.

###### v6
And we all have become like the unclean,
and all our deeds of justice like a menstrual cloth,
And we all wither like _a_ leaf,
and our iniquities take us away like the wind.

###### v7
And there is no one who calls on your name,
who pulls himself up to keep hold of you,
for you have hidden your face from us, ^[Or "him"]
and melted us into the hand of our iniquity.

###### v8
Yet now Yahweh, you _are_ our father;
we _are_ the clay and you _are_ our _potter_, ^[Literally "one who fashions"]
and we all _are_ the work of your hand.

###### v9
You must not be exceedingly angry, Yahweh,
and you must not remember iniquity forever!
Look! Behold, now! We all _are_ your people!

###### v10
_Your holy cities_ ^[Literally "The cities of your holiness"] have become a wilderness;
Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.

###### v11
_Our holy and beautiful temple_, ^[Literally "the house of our holiness and our beauty"] where our ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] praised you has _been burned_ ^[Literally "been for burning"] _by_ fire,
and all our precious objects have become ruins. ^[Hebrew "ruin"]

###### v12
Will you control yourself because of these, Yahweh?
Will you be silent?
And will you oppress us exceedingly?
