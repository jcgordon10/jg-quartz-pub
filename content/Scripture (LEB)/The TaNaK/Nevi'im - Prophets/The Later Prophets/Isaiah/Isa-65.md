[[Isa-64|Previous Chapter]] | [[Isa-66|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
"I let myself be sought by _those who_ did not ask;
I let myself be found by _those who_ did not seek me.
I said, 'Here I am; here I am!' to a nation _that_ did not call on my name;

###### v2
    I spread out my hands all day to a stubborn people,
those who walk after their thoughts _in_ the way _that is_ not good,

###### v3
    the people _who provoke_ ^[Literally "provoking"] me to anger continually to my face,
slaughtering for sacrifices in the garden,
and making smoke offerings on bricks,

###### v4
_who sit_ ^[Literally "sitting"] in graves
and spend the night in _secret places_, ^[Literally "watches"]
_who eat_ ^[Literally "eating"] the flesh of swine
with ^[Or "and"] a fragment ^[The reading tradition (_Qere_) has "broth"] of impurity _in_ their vessels,

###### v5
_who say_, ^[Literally "saying"] "_Keep to yourself_! ^[Literally "Come near to you"]
You must not come near me, for I am _too_ holy for you!"
These _are_ a smoke in my _nostrils_, ^[Literally "nose"]
a fire burning all day.

###### v6
Look! _It_ is written before me: I will not be silent, but I will repay;
and I will repay in ^[Or "on"] the fold of their garment

###### v7
your iniquities and the iniquities of your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] together, says Yahweh,
because they made smoke offerings on the mountains
and they taunted me on the hills,
I will measure their punishment _from the_ beginning into the fold of their garment."

###### v8
Thus says Yahweh: "Just as the new wine is found in the cluster, and they say 'You must not destroy it, for _there is_ a blessing in it,' so I will do for the sake of my servants _by_ ^[Literally "to"] not destroying _everyone_. ^[Literally "all"]

###### v9
And I will bring descendant s ^[Hebrew "descendant"] out from Jacob,
and a _people_ ^[Literally "man"] from Judah to take possession of my mountain,
and my chosen ones shall inherit it,
and my servants shall settle there.

###### v10
And Sharon shall become a pasture for ^[Literally "of"] flocks, ^[Hebrew "flock"]
and the valley of Achor a resting place for ^[Or "of"] herds ^[Hebrew "herd"]
for my people who have sought me.

###### v11
But ^[Or "and"] you _who forsake_ ^[Literally "forsaking"] Yahweh,
forgetting _my holy mountain_, ^[Literally "the mountain of my holiness"]
who set a table for Fortune,
and who _pour out_ ^[Literally "fill"] a jug of mixed wine for Destiny,

###### v12
and I will remit you to the sword,
and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter,
because I called, but ^[Or "and"] you did not answer;
I spoke, but ^[Or "and"] you did not listen,
but ^[Or "and"] you did the evil in my eyes,
and you chose that in which I do not delight."

###### v13
Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:
"Look! My servants shall eat but ^[Or "and"] you, you shall be hungry.
Look! My servants shall drink but ^[Or "and"] you, you shall be thirsty.
Look! My servants shall rejoice but ^[Or "and"] you, you shall be ashamed.

###### v14
Look! My servants shall shout _for joy_, ^[Literally "from goodness of heart"] but ^[Or "and"] you, you shall cry out _for pain_ ^[Literally "from pain of heart"] and howl _for sadness_. ^[Literally "from a breaking of _the_ spirit"]

###### v15
And you shall leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse,
and the Lord Yahweh will kill you, and he will _give_ ^[Literally "call"] his servants another name.

###### v16
Whoever blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of trustworthiness,
and the one who swears an oath in the land shall swear by the God of trustworthiness,
because the former troubles are forgotten,
and they are hidden from my eyes.

###### v17
For look! I _am_ about to create new heavens and a new earth,
and the former things shall not be remembered,
and they shall not _come to mind_. ^[Literally "go up to heart"]

###### v18
    But rejoice and shout in exultation forever and ever _over_ what I _am_ about to create!
For look! I _am_ about to create Jerusalem _as a source of_ rejoicing,
and her people _as a source of_ joy.

###### v19
And I will shout in exultation over Jerusalem,
and I will rejoice over my people,
and _the_ sound of weeping shall no longer be heard in it,
or ^[Or "and"] _the_ sound of a cry for help.

###### v20
There will no longer be a nursing infant _who lives only a few_ ^[Literally "of"] days,
or ^[Or "and"] an old man who does not fill his days,
for the boy will die _a hundred years old_, ^[Literally "a son of a hundred year"]
and the one who _fails to reach_ ^[Literally "misses"] _a hundred years_ ^[Literally "a son of a hundred year"] will be _considered_ ^[Literally "treated"] accursed.

###### v21
And they shall build houses and inhabit _them_,
and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.

###### v22
They shall not build and another inhabit;
they shall not plant and another eat.
For the days of my people _shall be_ like the days of _a_ tree,
and my chosen ones shall enjoy the work of their hands.

###### v23
They shall not labor for nothing,
and they shall not give birth to horror,
for they _shall be offspring blessed by_ ^[Literally "the offspring of the blessing of"] Yahweh,
and their descendants with them.

###### v24
And this will happen: before they call, I myself will answer;
_while_ still they _are_ speaking, I myself will hear.

###### v25
_The_ wolf and _the_ lamb shall feed like one,
and _the_ lion shall eat straw like the ox,
but ^[Or "and"] dust _shall be_ _the_ serpent's food.
They shall do no evil,
and they shall not destroy on all _my holy mountain_," ^[Literally "the mountain of my holiness"] says Yahweh.
