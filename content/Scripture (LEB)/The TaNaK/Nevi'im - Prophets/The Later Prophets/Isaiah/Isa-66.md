[[Isa-65|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Thus says Yahweh:
"Heaven _is_ my throne,
and the earth _is_ the footstool for my feet.
Where _is_ this house that you would build for me?
And where _is_ this resting place for me?

###### v2
And my hand has made all these _things_,
and all these _came to be_," ^[Literally "were"]
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh, "but ^[Or "and"] I look to this _one_:
to _the_ humble and _the_ contrite of spirit
and _the one_ frightened at my word.

###### v3
The one who slaughters _a_ bull strikes a man;
the one who slaughters _a_ lamb for sacrifice breaks the neck _of_ a dog.
The one who offers an offering, _the_ blood of swine;
the one who offers frankincense blesses an idol.
Indeed, they themselves have chosen their ways,
and their soul delights in their abhorrence.

###### v4
Indeed, I myself I will choose their ill treatment,
and I will bring them objects of their dread,
because I called, and _no one answered_; ^[Literally "there was no one who answers"]
I spoke and they did not listen,
but ^[Or "and"] they did the evil in my eyes,
and they chose that in which I do not delight."

###### v5
Hear the word of Yahweh, you who are frightened at his word:
Your brothers who hate you,
who exclude you for my name's sake have said,
"Let Yahweh be honored so that ^[Or "and"] we may see your joy!"
But ^[Or "And"] they themselves shall be ashamed.

###### v6
A voice, an uproar from _the_ city!
A voice from _the_ temple!
The voice of Yahweh _paying back_ ^[Literally "rewarding retribution to"] his enemies!

###### v7
Before she was in labor she gave birth;
before labor pains ^[Hebrew "pain"] came to her, she gave birth to a son.

###### v8
Who has heard _anything_ like this?
Who has seen _anything_ like these _things_?
Can a land be born in one day?
Or can a nation be born in a moment?
_Yet_ when she was in labor, Zion indeed gave birth _to_ her children.

###### v9
Shall I myself I break open and not _deliver_?" ^[Literally "cause to bring forth"] says Yahweh,
"or I who _delivers_ ^[Literally "causes to bring forth"] lock up _the womb_?" says your God.

###### v10
"Rejoice with Jerusalem
and shout in exultation with her, all those who love her!
Rejoice with her _in_ joy, all those who mourn over her,

###### v11
so that you may suck and be satisfied from her _consoling breast_, ^[Literally "breast of consolation"]
so that you may drink deeply and refresh yourselves from her _heavy breast_." ^[Literally "breast of heaviness "]

###### v12
For thus says Yahweh:
"Look! I _am_ about to spread prosperity out to her like a river,
and _the_ wealth of _the_ nations like an overflowing stream,
and you shall suck and be carried on the hip;
and you shall you shall be played with on the knees.

###### v13
As a man whose mother comforts him, so I myself will comfort you,
and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

###### v14
And you shall see and your heart shall rejoice,
and your bones shall _flourish_ ^[Literally "sprout"] like the grass,
and the hand of Yahweh shall make itself known _to_ ^[Literally "with"] his servants,
and he shall curse his enemies.

###### v15
For look! Yahweh will come in fire,
and his chariots like the storm wind,
to _give back_ ^[Literally "cause to turn around"] his anger in wrath,
and his rebuke in flames of fire.

###### v16
For Yahweh enters into judgment _on_ all flesh with fire and his sword,
and _those slain by_ ^[Literally "the slain of"] Yahweh shall be many.

###### v17
Those who sanctify themselves
and those who cleanse themselves _to go into_ ^[Literally "toward"] the gardens after _the_ one in the middle,
eating the flesh of swine
and detestable things ^[Hebrew "thing"] and rodents ^[Hebrew "rodent"] together
shall come to an end!" _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v18
"And I--their works and thoughts!--_am_ about to come to gather all nations and tongues,
and they shall come and see my glory.

###### v19
And I will set a sign among them,
and I will send survivors from them to the nations:
Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw _the_ bow;
Tubal and Javan, the faraway coastlands
that have not heard _of_ my fame,
and have not seen my glory.
And they shall declare my glory among the nations,

###### v20
and bring all your countrymen ^[Or "brothers"] from all the nations _as_ an offering to Yahweh on horses and chariots ^[Hebrew "chariot"] and in litters and on mules and camels, to ^[Or "on"] _my holy mountain_, ^[Literally "the mountain of holiness me"] Jerusalem," says Yahweh, "just as the sons of Israel bring _an_ offering in a clean vessel _to_ the house of Yahweh.

###### v21
And indeed, I will take some of them as priests _and_ the Levites," says Yahweh.

###### v22
"For just as the new heavens and earth that I _am_ about to make shall stand before me," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh, "so shall your descendants ^[Hebrew "descendant"] and your name stand.

###### v23
And this shall happen: From _new moon to new moon_ ^[Literally "enough of new moon in his new moon"] and from _Sabbath to Sabbath_ ^[Literally "enough of Sabbath in his Sabbath"] all flesh shall come to bow in worship before me," says Yahweh.

###### v24
"And they shall go out and look at the corpses of the people ^[Or "men"] _who have rebelled_ ^[Literally "rebelling"] against me,
for their worm shall not die,
and their fire shall not be quenched,
and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh."
