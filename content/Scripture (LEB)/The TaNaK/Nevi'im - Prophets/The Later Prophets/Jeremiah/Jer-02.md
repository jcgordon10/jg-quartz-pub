###### v1
And the word of Yahweh came to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Thus says Yahweh,
"I remember _concerning_ you the loyal love of your childhood, ^[Or "youth"]
the love of your betrothal-time,
your going ^[Or "walking"] after me in the desert, ^[Or "wilderness"]
in _the_ land not sown.

###### v3
Israel _was_ holy to Yahweh,
the first fruit of his produce.
All _those who_ ate it were held guilty;
disaster came to them," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.'"

###### v4
Hear the word of Yahweh, _O_ house of Jacob, and all the clans ^[Or "families"] of the house of Israel.

###### v5
Thus says Yahweh:
"What injustice did your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] find in me
that they were far from me,
and they went after the vanity,
and they became vain?

###### v6
And they did not say,
'Where _is_ Yahweh,
the one who brought us up from the land of Egypt,
the one who led us in the desert, ^[Or "wilderness"]
in a land of desert plains and gorges, ^[Hebrew "gorge"]
in a land of dryness and deep darkness,
in a land _that no one passes through_, ^[Literally "no man passes through in it"]
and no human lives there?'

###### v7
And I brought you to the land of the orchard,
to eat its fruit, and its good things. ^[Hebrew "good thing"]
But you entered and defiled my land,
and my inheritance you made a detestable thing. ^[Or "abomination"]

###### v8
The priests did not say, 'Where _is_ Yahweh?'
and those who handle the law did not know me,
and the shepherds have _rebelled against me_, ^[Literally "broken with me"]
and the prophets prophesied by Baal,
and they went after _things which_ do not profit.

###### v9
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] I again bring a lawsuit against you," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and with _your children_ ^[Literally "sons of your sons"] I bring a lawsuit.

###### v10
For go over _to_ the coasts of Cyprus and look,
and send _to_ Kedar and consider very closely,
and see if there has been _a thing_ like this:

###### v11
Has a nation exchanged gods? And they _are_ not gods!
But my people have exchanged their glory for that which does not profit.

###### v12
Be appalled, _O_ heavens, at this, and shudder;
be utterly desolate," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v13
"For my people have committed two evils:
they have forsaken me, _the_ source ^[Or "fountain"] of living water,
to hew out for themselves cisterns, cracked cisterns that can hold no water.

###### v14
_Is_ Israel a slave? Or _a slave born in a house_? ^[Literally "born of a house"]
Why has he become plunder?

###### v15
_The_ young lions have roared against him,
they have _raised_ ^[Literally "given"] their voices. ^[Hebrew "voice"]
And they have made his land as horror;
his cities are destroyed, _without_ ^[Literally "from not"] an inhabitant.

###### v16
Moreover, people of Memphis and Tahpanhes
will _shave_ ^[Literally "pasture"] your skull. ^[Or "crown of your head"]

###### v17
Did you not do this to yourself,
_by_ forsaking Yahweh, your God,
at the time of your leading in the way?

###### v18
And now _why do you go_ ^[Literally "what for you"] the way of Egypt
to drink the waters of the Shihor?
And _why do you go_ ^[Literally "what for you"] the way of Assyria
to drink the waters of the _Euphrates_? ^[Literally "river"]

###### v19
Your wickedness will chastise you,
and your apostasies will reprove you.
Therefore know and see that _it is_ evil and bitter,
your forsaking of Yahweh, your God,
and fear of me _is_ not in you,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.

###### v20
"For from long ago you have broken your yoke,
you tore to pieces your bonds.
And you said, 'I will not serve!'
But on every high hill and under every leafy tree
you _were_ lying down _as_ a prostitute.

###### v21
Yet I planted you _as_ a choice vine,
all of it a seed of trustworthiness.
How then have you altered before me
_into something that is_ degenerate, the foreign vine?

###### v22
For if you wash with natron,
and you _use much soap_, ^[Literally "make numerous for yourself alkaline salt"]
your guilt _is_ sticking as a stain _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] me,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] the Lord Yahweh.

###### v23
"How can you say, 'I have not defiled myself,
I have not gone after the Baals?'
Look at your way in the valley,
know what you have done.
_You are_ a young she-camel,
interweaving her ways.

###### v24
A wild ass accustomed to _the_ desert, ^[Or "wilderness"]
in the desire of her soul.
She gasps _for_ wind _in_ her rutting time.
Who can quell ^[Or "restrain"] her _lust_?
All _those who_ seek her will not grow weary,
in her month they will find her.

###### v25
Restrain your foot from _being_ barefoot,
and your throat from thirst.
But you said, '_It is_ hopeless.
No! For I have loved strangers,
and after them I will go.' ^[Or "walk"]

###### v26
As _the_ shame of a thief when he is caught in the act,
so the house of Israel will be ashamed.
They, their kings, their officials,
and their priests, and their prophets.

###### v27
_Those who_ say to the tree, 'You _are_ my father,'
and to the stone, 'You gave birth _to_ me.'
For they have turned _their_ _backs_ ^[Literally "neck"] to me, and not _their_ faces.
But in the time of their trouble they say, 'Arise and save us.'

###### v28
But where _are_ your gods that you made for yourself?
Let them arise if they can save you in the time of your trouble.
For _according to_ the number of your towns
are your gods, _O_ Judah.

###### v29
Why do you complain to me?
All of you have _rebelled against me_," ^[Literally "broken with me"] _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v30
"For _in vain_ ^[Literally "the vanity"] I have struck your children.
They accepted no discipline.
Your sword devoured your prophets,
like a ravening ^[Or "destroying"] lion.

###### v31
O generation, you see the word of Yahweh.
Have I been a desert ^[Or "wilderness"] to Israel? Or a land of great darkness?
Why do my people say, 'We roam about freely,
we will not come again to you'?

###### v32
Can a young woman forget her ornaments? ^[Or "jewelry"] _Or_ a bride her sashes?
Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.

###### v33
How well you do _on_ your way to seek love!
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] even _to_ the wicked _woman_ you can teach your ways.

###### v34
Also on your skirts is found
_the_ blood of _the_ life of _the_ innocent, _the_ poor.
You did not find them in the act of breaking into a house.
But in spite of all these _things_,

###### v35
yet you say, 'But I am innocent,
surely his anger has turned away from me.'
Look, I _am_ entering into judgment with you
because of your saying, 'I have not sinned.'

###### v36
How you go about so much changing your way!
Also by Egypt you will be put to shame,
just as you were put to shame by Assyria.

###### v37
Also from there you will come out
with your hands on your head,
for Yahweh has rejected _those in whom you trust_, ^[Literally "in your objects of trust"]
and you will not prosper through them.
