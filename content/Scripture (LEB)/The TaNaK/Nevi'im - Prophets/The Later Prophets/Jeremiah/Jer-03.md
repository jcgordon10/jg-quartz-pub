A _saying_: ^[Literally "to say"] 'Look, _if_ a man divorces his wife,
and she goes from him _and she becomes another man's wife_, ^[Literally "and she becomes to a man another"]
will he return to her again?'
Will not that land be greatly defiled?
And you have prostituted _yourself_ _with_ many lovers,
_would_ you now return to me?" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v2
"Lift up your eyes at _the_ barren heights,
and see where you have not been ravished.
Beside the roads you sat for them like an Arab in the desert, ^[Or "wilderness"]
and you have defiled _the_ land
with your fornication
and with your wickedness.

###### v3

and the spring rain has not come.
Yet _you have_ ^[Literally "it is for you"] _the_ forehead of a woman prostitute,
you refuse to be ashamed.

###### v4
Have you not just now called to me,
'My father, you _are_ the close friend of my youth?

###### v5
Will he be angry _forever_? ^[Literally "to eternity"]

Look, you have spoken,
but you have done all the evil that you could." ^[Literally "you have done the evil and you were able"]

###### v6
Then Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah, the king, "Have you seen what apostate ^[Or "unfaithful"] Israel has done? She has gone on every high hill and under every leafy tree and she has prostituted _herself_ there.

###### v7

###### v8
And I saw that _for this very reason, that_ ^[Literally "because of all"] on account of apostate ^[Or "unfaithful"] Israel committing adultery I divorced her and gave the letter of divorce to her. Yet her treacherous sister Judah was not afraid and she went and prostituted _herself_ also.

And it was because of the frivolity of her fornication that she defiled the land and committed adultery with the stone and with the tree.

###### v14
"Return, apostate ^[Or "unfaithful"] children," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh. "For _I am your master_, ^[Literally "I rule over among you"] and I will take you one from a city and two from a clan, ^[Or "family"] and I will bring you _to_ Zion.

###### v15

###### v16
And it will be when you have multiplied and become fruitful in the land in those days," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "they will no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of Yahweh.' And _it will not come to mind_, ^[Literally "it shall not go up on heart"] nor will they remember it, nor will they miss _it_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] nor will it be made again.

###### v17
At that time they will call Jerusalem 'The Throne of Yahweh,' and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem, and they will no longer go after the stubbornness of their evil heart.

###### v18
In those days the house of Judah will walk along with the house of Israel and they will come together from _the_ land of _the_ north to the land that I gave as an inheritance _to_ your ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v19
Then I thought, 'How I would set you among the children,
and I would give you a land of desire,

and you would not turn back from _behind_ ^[Or "following"] me.'

so you have dealt treacherously with me,
_O_ house of Israel," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

the weeping of the pleas for mercy of the children of Israel,
because they have perverted their way,

I will heal your backsliding.
'Look, we come to you,
for you are Yahweh our God.

_the_ turmoil _on_ the mountains.
Surely, in Yahweh our God
_is_ the salvation of Israel.

the labor of our ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] from our youth,
their flocks, and their cattle,

and let our disgrace cover us.
For against Yahweh our God we have sinned,
we and our ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"]
from our youth and until this day.
and we have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God.'
