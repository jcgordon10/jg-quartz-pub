###### v1
If you return, _O_ Israel," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"you return to me.
And if you remove your abominations from my _presence_, ^[Literally "faces"]
and you do not wander,

###### v2
and you swear, '_As Yahweh lives_,' ^[Literally "life of Yahweh"]
in truth, in justice, and in righteousness,
then nations will be blessed by him,
and in him they will boast."

###### v3
For thus says Yahweh
to the men ^[Hebrew "man"] of Judah and to Jerusalem,
"Break up for yourselves prepared virgin soil,
and you must not sow among thornbushes.

###### v4
Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh,
and remove the foreskins of your hearts, ^[Hebrew "heart"]
men ^[Hebrew "man"] of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem,
lest my wrath goes forth like the fire and burns,
and there is no _one who_ extinguishes _it_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]
because of the evil of your deeds."

###### v5
Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say,
"Blow a horn through the land,
_call with a loud voice_ ^[Literally "call fill"] and say,
'Be gathered and let us go into the fortified cities.'

###### v6
Lift up a signal toward Zion,
bring yourselves to safety; you must not remain standing,
for I _am_ bringing evil from _the_ north,
and a great destruction.

###### v7
A lion has gone up from his thicket,
and a destroyer of nations has set out.
He has gone out from his place to make your land as a horror,
your cities will go to ruin _without_ ^[Literally "from not"] inhabitant.

###### v8
Because of this gird yourselves _with_ sackcloth, ^[Hebrew "sackcloths"] lament and wail,
for _the burning anger_ ^[Literally "the blaze of the nose"] of Yahweh has not turned back from us.

###### v9
And then on that day," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"the heart of the king and the heart of the officials will be destroyed,
and the priests will be appalled,
and the prophets will be astonished."

###### v10
Then I said, "Ah, Lord Yahweh, surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'It will be peace for you,' while the sword reaches up to the throat."

###### v11
At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem,
"_A hot wind from the barren heights_ ^[Literally "a wind of shimmering of barren heights"] in the desert, ^[Or "wilderness"]
_in the direction of_ ^[Literally "the way of"] the daughter of my people,
not to winnow and not to cleanse,

###### v12
_a wind too strong for_ ^[Literally "a wind strong more than"] these will come for me,
now also I speak judgments against them."

###### v13
Look, he comes up like the clouds,
and his chariots _are_ like the whirlwind,
his horses are swifter than eagles,
woe to us, for we are devastated.

###### v14
Cleanse your heart from wickedness, _O_ Jerusalem,
so that you may be saved.
_How long_ ^[Literally "until when"] will your thoughts of mischief
dwell in your inner part?

###### v15
For a voice _is_ declaring from Dan,
and _is_ proclaiming disaster from the mountain of Ephraim.

###### v16
"Report to the nations, 'Here they are!'
Proclaim against Jerusalem,
'Besiegers _are_ coming _from a distant land_, ^[Literally "from a land the distance place"]
and they raise their voice against the cities of Judah.'

###### v17
Like watchers of a field they were against her from all around,
because she has rebelled against me," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v18
"You obtained this for yourself
_because of_ your way and your deeds.
This _is_ your doom, for _it is_ bitter,
yes, it has reached up to your heart."

###### v19
My bowels, my bowels! I writhe!
The walls of my heart!
My heart is restless within me, I cannot keep silent,
for I hear _in_ my inner self the sound of a horn, _the_ alarm of war.

###### v20
Destruction on destruction is proclaimed,
for all of the land is devastated.
Suddenly my tents are devastated,
my tent curtains in a moment.

###### v21
How long must I see _the_ banner,
_and_ hear _the_ sound of a horn?

###### v22
"For my people _are_ foolish,
they have not known me.
They _are_ foolish children,
and they do not have insight.
They _are_ skillful at doing evil,
and they do not know _how_ to do good."

###### v23
I looked at the earth, and behold, it was wasteland and emptiness,
and to the heavens, and _they were_ without their light.

###### v24
I looked at the mountains, and behold, they were quaking,
and all of the hills were jolted to and fro.

###### v25
I looked and behold, there was no person,
and all of the birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of the sky had fled.

###### v26
I looked and behold, the fruitful land _was_ a desert, ^[Or "wilderness"]
and all of its cities were ruined before Yahweh,
before the face of _his burning anger_. ^[Literally "the blaze of his nose"]

###### v27
For thus says Yahweh, "All of the land will be a desolation,
yet I will not make a complete desolation.

###### v28
Because of this the earth will mourn,
and the heavens above will become dark.
Because I have spoken, I have planned,
and I have not relented, and I will not turn back from it."

###### v29
From the sound of a horseman and _an archer_ ^[Literally "one who shoots arrows of a bow"] every town flees,
they enter in the thickets and among the rocks they climb.
Every town _is_ forsaken,
and there is no person _who_ lives in them.

###### v30
And you, _O_ devastated one, what _do_ you do,
that you put on crimson,
that you adorn yourself _with_ ornaments of gold,
that you make your eyes look bigger with the eye make-up?
In vain you beautify yourself.
_Your_ lovers reject you;
they seek your life.

###### v31
For I heard a voice like an ill woman,
anxiety like _a woman who_ bears her first child,
the voice of the daughter of Zion.
She is gasping for breath,
she is spreading out her hands:
"Woe is me, for I am becoming tired ^[Or "fainting"] before killers."
