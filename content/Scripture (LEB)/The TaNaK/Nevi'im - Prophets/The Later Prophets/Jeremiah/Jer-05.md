###### v1
"Roam about through the streets of Jerusalem,
and look please, and take note,
and search at its public squares,
if you can find a person _who_ does justice,
_who_ seeks honesty,
so that I may forgive it.

###### v2
And though they say, '_As Yahweh lives_,' ^[Literally "Life of Yahweh"]
_therefore_ ^[Literally "to thus"] they swear falsely."

###### v3
_O_ Yahweh, do not your eyes _look_ for honesty?
You have struck them, but they felt no pain,
you have destroyed them, they refused to take discipline.
They have hardened their faces more than rock,
they have refused to turn back.

###### v4
Then I said, "_They are_ just simple people,
they are foolish,
for they know not the way of Yahweh,
the law ^[Or "ordinance"] of their God.

###### v5
Let me go to the great,
and let me speak with them,
for they know the way of Yahweh,
the law ^[Or "ordinance"] of their God."
However, they together have broken _the_ yoke,
they have torn to pieces _the_ bonds.

###### v6
Therefore a lion from _the_ forest will kill them,
A wolf _from the_ desert plains ^[Or "Arabah"] will devastate them.
A leopard _is_ watching their cities,
everyone _who_ goes out from there will be torn,
because their transgressions are many,
their apostasies are numerous.

###### v7
"_How_ ^[Literally "Why to this"] can I forgive you?
Your children have forsaken me,
and they have sworn by _those who are_ not gods.
But I fed them to the full,
and they committed adultery,
and flocked _to_ the house of a prostitute.

###### v8
They were well-fed lusty horses,
they neighed each to the wife of his neighbor.

###### v9
Because of these _things_ shall I not punish?" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and on a nation who _is_ like this, shall I not take revenge?

###### v10
Go up through her vineyards and destroy,
but you must not make complete destruction.
Remove her branches,
for they _are_ not to Yahweh.

###### v11
For the house of Israel and the house of Judah
have dealt utterly treacherously with me," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v12
"They have denied Yahweh, and have said,
'Not he, _for_ ^[Literally "and"] evil will not come on us,
we will see neither sword nor famine.

###### v13
And the prophets are like wind,
and the word _is_ not in them.'
Thus it will be done to them."

###### v14
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts,
"Because you have spoken this word,
look, I _am_ making my words in your mouth like a fire,
and this people wood, and it will devour them.

###### v15
Look, I _am_ about to bring on you a nation from afar,
_O_ house of Israel," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.
"It _is_ an enduring nation, it _is_ _an ancient nation_. ^[Literally "a nation from a long time ago"]
A nation whose language you do not know,
and you cannot understand what they speak.

###### v16
Their quiver _is_ like an open tomb,
all of them _are_ warriors.

###### v17
And they will eat your harvest and your food,
they will eat your sons and your daughters,
they will eat your flock and your herd,
they will eat your vine and your fig tree,
they will smash with the sword _your fortified cities_, ^[Literally "the cities of your fortification"]
in which you trust.

###### v18
"But even in those days," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "I will not make you a complete destruction.

###### v19
_And then_, ^[Literally "And it will happen"] when you _people_ say, 'Why has Yahweh our God done all of these _things_ to us?' Then you will say to them, 'As you have forsaken me and have served gods of a foreign land in your land, so will you serve strangers in _a land that does not belong to you_.' ^[Literally "a land not to you"]

###### v20
"Declare this in the house of Jacob,
and proclaim it in Judah, saying,

###### v21
'Hear this please, _O_ foolish and _senseless_ ^[Literally "without heart"] people,
_who have eyes_ ^[Literally "eyes for them"] but do not see,
_who have ears_ ^[Literally "ears for them"] but do not hear.'

###### v22
Do you not revere me?" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"Do you not tremble _before me_? ^[Literally "from the face of me"]
For I have placed _the_ sand _as_ a boundary for the sea,
_as an everlasting limit_, ^[Literally "a limit of eternity"] and it cannot pass over it,
and they rise and fall loudly, but they cannot prevail,
and its waves roar, but they cannot pass over it.

###### v23
But for this people is a stubborn and rebellious heart,
they have turned aside and have gone _away_.

###### v24
And they do not say in their hearts,
'Let us fear please Yahweh our God,
the _one who_ gives _the_ autumn rain ^[Hebrew "early rain"] and _the_ spring rain ^[Hebrew "late rain"] in its season,
_the set times of the harvest_ ^[Literally "weeks due harvest"] he keeps for us.'

###### v25
Your iniquities have disturbed these,
and your sins have kept away the good from you.

###### v26
For wicked people are found among my people,
they lie in wait like the hiding of fowlers,
they set up a trap,
they catch humans.

###### v27
Like a cage full of birds, ^[Hebrew "bird"]
so their houses _are_ full of fraud.
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "Unto thus"] they have become great,
and they have become rich.

###### v28
They have grown fat,
they have grown sleek,
also, _their evil deeds have no limit_. ^[Literally "they cross over evil deeds"]
They do not judge _with_ justice,
_the_ legal cause of _the_ orphan,
or allow it to succeed,
and _the_ legal case of _the_ poor,
they do not defend.

###### v29
Because of these _things_ shall I not punish?" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and on a nation who _is_ like this, shall I not take revenge?

###### v30
A horrific event and something horrible has happened in the land.

###### v31
The prophets prophesy _falsely_, ^[Literally "in the lie"]
and the priests rule _by their own authority_, ^[Literally "by their hands"]
and my people love _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] so much.
But what will you do _when the end comes_? ^[Literally "to end her"]
