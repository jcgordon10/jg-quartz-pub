###### v1
Flee for safety, _O_ children of Benjamin,
from the midst of Jerusalem.
And in Tekoa blow a horn,
and on Beth-haccherem lift up a signal,
for evil looks down from _the_ north,
and a great destruction.

###### v2
The lovely and the delicate,
the daughter of Jerusalem, I will destroy.

###### v3
Shepherds and their flocks will come against her,
they will pitch _their_ tents against her all around,
they will pasture, each his _portion_. ^[Literally "hand"]

###### v4
_Sanctify_ ^[Or "Consecrate"] war against her.
Arise, and let us attack at noon.
Woe to us, for the day turns,
for _the_ shadows of evening are lengthened.

###### v5
Arise, and let us attack by night,
and let us destroy her citadel fortresses."

###### v6
For thus says Yahweh of hosts,
"Cut down trees and heap up a siege ramp against Jerusalem.
This _is_ the city that must be punished,
its oppression _is_ in its midst.

###### v7
As a water well keeps its water cool,
so she keeps cool her wickedness.
Violence and destruction are heard within her,
sickness and wounds ^[Hebrew "wound"] _are_ continually _before me_. ^[Literally "at the face of me"]

###### v8
Be warned, _O_ Jerusalem,
lest I turn away from you in disgust,
lest I make you a desolation,
a land that is not inhabited."

###### v9
Thus says Yahweh of hosts:
"They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine,
turn back your hand over _the_ branches like a grape-gatherer.

###### v10
To whom shall I speak and admonish,
that they may hear?
Look, their ears _are_ _closed_, ^[Literally "uncircumcised"]
and they are not able to listen attentively.
Look, the word of Yahweh is to them an object of scorn,
they do not delight in it.

###### v11
But I am full with the wrath of Yahweh,
I struggle to hold _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] in.
Pour _it_ out on _the_ children ^[Hebrew "child"] in the street,
and on the assemblies ^[Hebrew "assembly"] of young men at the same time.
For even husband with wife will get trapped,
_the_ old with _him who is_ full of days.

###### v12
And their houses will be turned over to others,
_their_ fields and _their_ wives together.
For I will stretch out my hand
against the inhabitants of the land," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v13
"For from the smallest of them to the greatest of them,
_everyone_ ^[Literally "all of him"] makes profit for unlawful gain.
And from the prophet to the priest,
_everyone_ ^[Literally "all of him"] practices deceit.

###### v14
And they have treated the wound of my people lightly,
_saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Peace, peace,' but there is no peace.

###### v15
Have they acted ashamed, for they have committed a detestable thing?
Not at all, nor were they ashamed; they did not know to feel humiliated.
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] they will fall among _those who_ fall at the time I punish them,
they will stumble," says Yahweh.

###### v16
Thus says Yahweh: "Stand at _the_ roads and look,
and ask for _the_ ancient paths, where the way of the good _is_,
and walk in it, and find rest for your inner selves. ^[Hebrew "inner self"]
But they said, 'We will not walk _in it_.' ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v17
And I raised up watchmen over you:
'Listen attentively to _the_ sound of a horn.'
But they said, 'We will not listen attentively.'

###### v18
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] hear, O nations, and know, _O_ community,
_what will happen to them_. ^[Literally "what among them"]

###### v19
Hear, O earth,
look, I _am_ about to bring disaster to this people,
the fruit of their plans,
because they have not listened attentively to my words,
and my teaching, they have rejected it also.

###### v20
What _is_ this to me?
Frankincense comes from Sheba,
and the precious spice reed from a distant land.
Your burnt offerings _are_ not _acceptable_, ^[Literally "for acceptance"]
your sacrifices are not pleasing to me."

###### v21
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh:
"Look, I _am_ about to put before this people stumbling blocks,
and they will stumble against them,
fathers and children together,
neighbor and his friend will perish."

###### v22
Thus says Yahweh:
"Look, a people _is_ coming from _the_ land of _the_ north,
a great nation is woken up from _the_ farthest part of _the_ earth.

###### v23
_The_ bow and _the_ short sword they grasp _are_ cruel,
and they show no mercy.
Their sound roars like the sea, and on horses they ride,
drawn up like a man for battle against you, O daughter of Zion."

###### v24
We have heard news of it,
our hands grow slack,
anxiety has grasped us,
pain as a _woman who_ gives birth.

###### v25
You must not go out _into_ the field,
and you must not walk on the road,
for _the enemy has a sword_, ^[Literally "a sword for enemy"]
terror _is_ all around.

###### v26
O daughter of my people,
gird yourself _with_ sackcloth,
and roll about in the ashes in mourning,
a mourning ceremony _as for_ an only child.
Make for yourself wailing of bitterness,
for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.

###### v27
"I have made you an assayer among my people, a fortification,
so that you may know and put to the test their ways. ^[Hebrew "way"]

###### v28
All of them _are_ stubborn rebels,
going about _talking_ slander.
_They are_ bronze and iron,
they _are_ all behaving corruptly.

###### v29
_The_ bellows ^[Hebrew "bellow"] are burned up,
lead is consumed by fire.
_In vain_ ^[Literally "To the vanity"] _he keeps on refining_, ^[Literally "he refines refining"]
but _the_ wicked are not torn apart.

###### v30
_They are called_ ^[Literally "They call to them"] rejected silver,
For Yahweh has rejected them."
