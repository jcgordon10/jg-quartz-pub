###### v1
The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Stand in the gate of the house of Yahweh and proclaim there this word, and say, 'Hear the word of Yahweh, all of Judah, _those who_ enter through these gates to bow in worship to Yahweh.

###### v3
Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, "Make your ways and your deeds good and let me dwell with you in this place.

###### v4
Do not trust in _the deceitful words_, ^[Literally "the words of the deception"] _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'The temple of Yahweh, the temple of Yahweh, they _are_ the temple of Yahweh.'

###### v5
For if you truly make your ways and your deeds good, if you truly do justice between a man and his neighbor,

###### v6
you do not oppress _the_ alien, _the_ orphan, and _the_ widow, you do not shed innocent blood in this place, and you do not go after other gods _to your harm_, ^[Literally "to harm to you"]

###### v7
then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] _forever and ever_. ^[Literally "from eternity and until eternity"]

###### v8
Look, you _are_ relying for yourselves on _deceitful words_ ^[Literally "the words of the deception"] without benefiting.

###### v9
Will you steal? Will you murder? And will you commit adultery? And will you swear _falsely_? ^[Literally "to the lie"] And will you make a smoke offering to the Baal? And will you go after other gods whom you have not known?

###### v10
And then you come and you stand _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] me in this house, which is called _by my name_, ^[Literally "my name over it"] and you say, 'we are safe _to go on doing_ ^[Literally "for the sake of the doing of"] all of these detestable things.'

###### v11
Has this house, which is called _by my name_, ^[Literally "my name over it"] become a cave of robbers in your eyes? Look, I, even I, have seen _it_,"  ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v12
"For go now to my place that _was_ in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell in the beginning, and see what I did to it _because of_ ^[Literally "from face"] the wickedness of my people Israel.

###### v13
And now, because of your doing all these things," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "and _I have spoken to you over and over again_, ^[Literally "I spoke to you doing early and speaking"] and you have not listened, and I called you, and you have not answered,

###### v14
therefore I will do to the house that is called _by my name_, ^[Literally "my name over it"] in which you _are_ trusting, and to the place that I gave to you and to your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] _what_ ^[Literally "as that"] I did to Shiloh.

###### v15
And I will cast you _out of my sight_ ^[Literally "from at my face"] just as I cast out all of your blood relatives, ^[Or "brothers"] all of the offspring of Ephraim."'

###### v16
"And you, you must not pray for this people, and you must not lift up for them a cry of entreaty or a prayer, and you must not plead with me, for I _will_ not hear you.

###### v17
_Do_ you not see what they _are_ doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

###### v18
The children _are_ gathering wood, and the fathers _are_ kindling the fire, and the women _are_ kneading dough to make sacrificial cakes for the queen of heaven, and they pour out libations to other gods for the sake of provoking me to anger.

###### v19
_Are_ they provoking me to anger? " _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "_Is it_ not themselves _they hurt_, for the sake of the shame of their faces?"

###### v20
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says the Lord Yahweh, "Look, my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, on the humankind, and on the animal, and on the tree of the field, and on the fruit of the ground, and it will not be extinguished."

###### v21
Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, "Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat _the_ flesh.

###### v22
For I did not speak with your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] nor did I command them in the day of bringing them out from the land of Egypt, concerning the matter of burnt offering and sacrifice.

###### v23
But I only commanded them this word, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Obey my voice, and I will be to you God, and you will be to me people, and you must walk in all of the way that I command you, so that it goes well with you.'

###### v24
Yet they did not obey, and they did not incline their ear, but they walked in _their own_ plans, in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and _they became worse instead of better_. ^[Literally "they were to backward and not to face"]

###### v25
From the day that your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] came out from the land of Egypt until this day I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, day after day, _sending again and again_. ^[Literally "doing early and sending"]

###### v26
Yet they have not listened to me and they have not inclined their ear, but they have hardened their neck, they did more evil than their ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v27
So you shall speak to them all these words, but they will not listen to you, and you shall call to them, but they will not answer you.

###### v28
"And you shall say to them, 'This _is_ the nation that has not obeyed the voice of Yahweh their God, and they have not accepted discipline. The truth has perished, and it is cut off from their mouths. ^[Hebrew "mouth"]

###### v29
Shear your hair and throw _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] away, and lift up a lament on the barren heights, for Yahweh has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.'

###### v30
For the people  ^[Or "children"] of Judah have done evil in my eyes," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "They have set their abominations in the house that is called _by my name_, ^[Literally "my name over it"] to defile it.

###### v31
And they built the high place of Topheth, which _is_ in _the_ Valley of Ben Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I have not commanded, and it did not come into my mind. ^[Or "heart"]

###### v32
Therefore look, days _are_ about to come," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "and it will no longer be called Topheth or _the_ Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of the Slaughter, and they will bury in Topheth _until there is no more place_. ^[Literally "from there is no place"]

###### v33
And the dead bodies ^[Hebrew "body"] of this people _will be_ as food for the birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of the heavens, ^[Or "sky"] and for the animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] of the earth, without anyone to scare _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] away.

###### v34
And I will cause to disappear from the towns of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem _the_ sound of jubilation, and _the_ sound of joy, _the_ voice of _the_ bridegroom, and _the_ voice of _the_ bride, for the land will become a site of ruins.
