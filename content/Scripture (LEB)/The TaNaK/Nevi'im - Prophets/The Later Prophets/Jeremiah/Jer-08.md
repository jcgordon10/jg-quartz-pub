###### v1
"At that time," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of its officials, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Judah from their graves.

###### v2
And they shall spread them out before the sun, and before the moon, and before all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and which they have gone after, and which they have inquired about, and to which they have bowed in worship. They shall not be gathered, and they shall not be buried; they will be like dung on the surface of the ground.

###### v3
And death will be preferred to life by all the remaining of this evil clan ^[Or "family"] in all the remaining places where I have driven them away," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v4
"And you shall say to them, 'Thus asks ^[Or "says"] Yahweh:
"Do men fall and not stand up?
If one turns away does he not return?

###### v5
Why has this people, Jerusalem, turned away _in_ enduring apostasy?
They have kept hold of deceit, they have refused to return. ^[Or "repent"]

###### v6
I have listened attentively,
and I have listened.
They do not speak honestly,
there is no man _who_ regrets his wickedness, saying, 'What have I done?'
All of them _are_ turning to their ways of running,
like a horse plunging into battle.

###### v7
Even _the_ stork in heaven knows its appointed time,
and _the_ turtledove, and _the_ swallow, and _the_ song bird,
they observe the time of their coming.
But my people do not know the ordinance ^[Or "law"] of Yahweh.

###### v8
How can you say, 'We _are_ wise and the law of Yahweh _is_ with us'?
Look, surely _the lying stylus of the scribes_ ^[Literally "stylus of lie of scribes"] has made it a lie.

###### v9
_The_ wise will be put to shame,
they will be dismayed,
and they will get taken.
Look, they have rejected the word of Yahweh,
and what _is_ wisdom to them?

###### v10
Therefore I will give their wives to others,
their fields to conquerors,
because from _the_ smallest to _the_ greatest,
all of them make profit _for_ unlawful gain,
from prophet to priest,
all of them practice deceit.

###### v11
And they have treated the wound of the daughter of my people lightly,
_saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Peace, peace,' but there is no peace.

###### v12
Were they ashamed, for they had committed a detestable thing?
What's worse, ^[Or "also"] they were not ashamed at all,
and they did not know to feel humiliated.
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] they will fall among _those who_ fall;
at the time of their punishment they will stumble," says Yahweh.

###### v13
"_I will take away their harvest_," ^[Literally "I will take away, I will make an end _to_ them"] _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.
"There are no grapes on the vine,
and there are no figs on the fig tree,
and the leaves wither,
and _what_ I gave to them passed over them."'"

###### v14
Why _are_ we sitting?
Gather, and let us go into the fortified cities,
and let us perish there,
for Yahweh our God has caused us to perish,
and has provided drink for us, water of poison,
because we have sinned against Yahweh.

###### v15
_We_ hope for peace,
but there is no good,
for a time of healing,
but there is terror.

###### v16
"From Dan is heard the snorting of their horses,
from the sound of the neighing of their stallions all the land quakes,
for they come and devour the land,
and that which fills _the_ city,
and _those who_ live in it.

###### v17
For look, I _am_ letting loose among you snakes,
adders for which there is no incantation,
and they will bite you," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v18
"My comfort _is gone_ from me,
sorrow _is_ on me,
my heart _is_ sick.

###### v19
Look, the sound of the cry for help of the daughter of my people
from a distant land,
'Is Yahweh not in Zion?
Is her king not in her?'
Why have they provoked me to anger with their images,
with idols of a foreign land?"

###### v20
_The_ harvest has passed,
_the_ summer has come to an end,
and we have not received help. ^[Or "been saved"]

###### v21
"Because of the wound of the daughter of my people I am broken down,
I mourn, horror has seized me.

###### v22
Is there no balm in Gilead?
Is there no healer there?
Why, then, has the healing of the daughter of my people not been restored?
