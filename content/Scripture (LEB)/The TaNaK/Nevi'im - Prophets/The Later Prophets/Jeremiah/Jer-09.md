###### v1
 ^[[[Jer-09|Jeremiah 9:1–26]] in the English Bible is 8:23–9:25 in the Hebrew Bible] _Oh that my head were waters_, ^[Literally "Who he gives my head waters"]
and my eyes a fountain of tears,
so that I might weep day and night,
_for_ the slain of the daughter of my people.

###### v2
_Oh that I had_ ^[Literally "Who he gives me"] in the desert a place of overnight lodging for travelers,
that I may leave my people and go from them,
for all of them _are_ adulterers,
a band of traitors.

###### v3
And they bend their tongue _like_ their bow,
_for_ falsehood and not truth is superior in the land,
for they go forth ^[Or "proceed"] from evil to evil,
and they do not know me," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v4
"Let everyone be on your guard against his neighbor,
and you must not trust in any brother,
for everyone surely betrays,
and every neighbor goes about _with_ slander.

###### v5
And everyone deceives his neighbor,
and they do not speak _the_ truth,
they have taught their tongues ^[Hebrew "tongue"] to speak lies, ^[Hebrew "lie"]
they are tired _from_ going astray.

###### v6
Your dwelling _is_ in the midst of deceit,
upon ^[Or "through"] deceit they refuse to know me," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v7
Therefore, thus says Yahweh of hosts:
"Look, I _am_ about to refine them,
and I will test them,
for what else can I do,
because of the _presence_ ^[Literally "faces"] of the daughter of my people?

###### v8
Their tongue _is_ a murderous arrow,
it speaks deceit.
With his mouth he speaks peace with his neighbor,
but in his inner parts he sets up his ambush.

###### v9
Because of these _things_ shall I not punish them?" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"On a nation that _is_ like this shall I not take revenge?

###### v10
For the mountains I lift up weeping and wailing,
and for _the_ pastures of _the_ desert a lament,
because they are laid waste so that no man passes through.
And _the_ sounds ^[Hebrew "sound"] of cattle are not heard,
from _the_ birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of heaven to _the_ animals ^[Hebrew "animal"]
they have fled, they are gone.

###### v11
And I will make Jerusalem as heaps _of ruins_, a lair of jackals,
and the towns of Judah I will make a desolation, _without inhabitants_. ^[Literally "from no inhabitant"]

###### v12
Who _is_ the wise man that can understand this?
And to whom has the mouth of Yahweh spoken, so that he may declare it?
Why is the land destroyed?
It is laid waste like the desert ^[Or "wilderness"] so that no one passes through."

###### v13
And Yahweh said, "Because of their forsaking my law that I set _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] them, and they have not obeyed my voice, and have not walked in it,

###### v14
but they went after the stubbornness of their heart, and after the Baals, which their ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] taught them."

###### v15
Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, "Look, I _am_ feeding this people wormwood, and providing drink for them, water of poison,

###### v16
and I will scatter them among the nations that they have not known, they and their ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] and I will send the sword after them until I bring them to an end."

###### v17
Thus says Yahweh of hosts:
"Consider closely, and call for the wailing women, so that they come,
and for the skillful women, so that they come.

###### v18
And let them hasten,
and let them lift up wailing over us,
so that our eyes may melt _with_ tears,
and our eyelids may flow _with_ water.

###### v19
For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion,
'How we are devastated!
We are very ashamed because we have left the land,
because they have overthrown our dwelling places.'

###### v20
For hear, _O_ women, the word of Yahweh,
and let your ear receive the word of his mouth,
and teach your daughters a lamentation,
and each woman her neighbor a lament.

###### v21
For death has come into our windows,
it has entered into our fortresses,
to cut off _the_ children ^[Hebrew "child"] from _the_ streets, ^[Hebrew "street"]
_the_ young men from _the_ public squares.

###### v22
Speak, 'thus _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh:
"The dead body of the human will fall
like dung upon the surface of the field,
and like cut grain behind the reaper,
and there is no _one who_ gathers."'"

###### v23
Thus says Yahweh,
"_The_ wise man must not boast in his wisdom,
and the warrior must not boast in his might,
_the_ wealthy man must not boast in his wealth.

###### v24
_But only_ ^[Literally "But it"] in this must the one who boasts boast,
_that_ he has insight,
and _that_ he knows me,
that I _am_ Yahweh,
showing loyal love, justice, and righteousness on the earth,
for in these _things_ I delight," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v25
"Look, days _are_ coming," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "and I will call into account all those who are circumcised in _the_ foreskin:

###### v26
Egypt, Judah, and Edom, and the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] and Moab, and all those who are trimmed to _the_ side, those who live in the desert, ^[Or "wilderness"] for all the nations _are_ uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel _are_ uncircumcised of heart."
