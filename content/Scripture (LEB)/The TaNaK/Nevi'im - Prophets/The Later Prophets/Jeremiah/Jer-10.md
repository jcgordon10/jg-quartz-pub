###### v1
Hear the word that Yahweh speaks to you, _O_ house of Israel.

###### v2
Thus says Yahweh:
"You must not learn the way of the nations,
and you must not be dismayed by the signs of the heavens,
for the nations are dismayed by them.

###### v3
For the statutes of the peoples _are_ vanity,
for it _is_ a tree cut down from _the_ forest,
_the_ work of _the_ hands of a craftsman with the tool.

###### v4
He decorates it with silver and gold,
they strengthen it with nails and hammers,
so that it does not stagger.

###### v5
They _are_ like scarecrows ^[Hebrew "scarecrow"] in a cucumber field,
they cannot speak.
Indeed, they must be carried,
for they cannot march.
You must not be afraid of them,
for they cannot do evil;
furthermore, to do good _is_ not in them."

###### v6
There is none like you, _O_ Yahweh,
you _are_ great and your name _is_ great in might.

###### v7
Who would not revere you, O king of the nations?
For you it is fitting.
For among all the wise men of the nations,
and in all their kingdoms, ^[Hebrew "kingdom"]
there is none like you.

###### v8
_At the same time_ ^[Literally "And in one"] they are stupid and foolish,
_in the_ instruction of idols, it _is_ wood.

###### v9
Silver beaten from Tarshish is brought,
and gold from Uphaz,
the work of _the_ craftsman and _the_ hands of the goldsmith.
Blue and purple _are_ their clothing,
all of them _are_ the work of skillful people.

###### v10
But Yahweh _is_ the true God,
he _is_ the living God,
and _an everlasting king_. ^[Literally "a king of eternity"]
Because of his wrath the earth quakes,
and _the_ nations cannot endure his anger.

###### v11
"_Thus_ ^[Literally "Like this"] you shall say to them,
'Gods who did not make the heavens and the earth
will perish from the earth and from under these heavens.

###### v12
_He is_ the maker of _the_ earth by his power,
_who_ created the world by his wisdom,
and by his understanding he stretched out heaven.

###### v13
_When he utters his voice_ ^[Literally "At the voice of his giving"] _there is_ a noise of water in the heavens,
and he causes _the_ mist to rise from _the_ ends ^[Hebrew "end"] of the earth.
He makes lightning for the rain,
and he causes _the_ wind to go out from his storehouses.

###### v14
_Everyone_ ^[Literally "All humankind"] is stupid, _without knowledge_, ^[Literally "from knowledge"]
every goldsmith is ashamed by _his_ divine image,
for his cast image _is_ an illusion,
and _there is_ no breath in them.

###### v15
They _are_ vanity, a work of mockery,
at the time of their punishment, they will perish.

###### v16
The portion of Jacob _is_ not like these,
for he _is_ the creator of everything,
and Israel _is_ the tribe of his inheritance,
Yahweh of hosts _is_ his name.

###### v17
Gather your bundle from _the_ ground,
you who live under the siege.'"

###### v18
For thus says Yahweh,
"Look, I _am_ about to sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time,
and I will bring distress to them, so that they may feel it."

###### v19
Woe to me, because of my wound.
My wound _is_ incurable.
But I said, "Surely this _is my_ sickness,
and I must bear it."

###### v20
My tent is devastated,
and all my tent cords are torn.
My children have gone out _from_ me,
and they are not.
There is no _one who_ pitches my tent again,
or _one who_ puts up my tent curtains.

###### v21
For the shepherds have become stupid,
they do not seek Yahweh.
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "Unto thus"] they do not have insight,
and all of their flock are scattered.

###### v22
Listen, news: ^[Or "a report"]
Look, _it is_ coming,
a great roar from _the_ land of _the_ north,
to make the cities of Judah a desolation,
a lair of jackals.

###### v23
I know, _O_ Yahweh, that to the human _is_ not his _own_ way,
nor to a person _is the_ walking and the directing of his _own_ step.

###### v24
Chastise ^[Or "Discipline"] me, _O_ Yahweh, but in moderation,
not in your anger, lest you eradicate me.

###### v25
Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you,
and on _the_ peoples that do not call on your name,
for they have devoured Jacob,
they have devoured and consumed him,
and they have caused his settlement to be desolate.
