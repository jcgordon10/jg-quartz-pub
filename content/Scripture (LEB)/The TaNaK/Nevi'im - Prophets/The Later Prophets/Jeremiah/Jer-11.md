###### v1
The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the _people_ ^[Literally "man"] of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,

###### v3
and say to them, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: "The man is cursed who does not obey the words of this covenant,

###### v4
which I commanded your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] in the day of my bringing them from the land of Egypt, from the furnace of iron, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Listen to my voice and do according to all that I command you, _so will you be my people, and I will be your God_.' ^[Literally "and you shall be to me as people and I will be to you as God"]

###### v5
in order to keep the oath that I swore to your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as _it is_ this day."'" Then I answered and said, "_Let it be so_, ^[Literally "Amen"] O Yahweh."

###### v6
And Yahweh said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Hear the words of this covenant and do them,

###### v7
for I solemnly admonished your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] in the day of my leading them out from the land of Egypt and up to this day, _admonishing persistently_, ^[Literally "do early and admonishing"] _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "Obey my voice."

###### v8
But they did not obey and they did not incline their ear. Instead each one walked in the stubbornness of his ^[Hebrew "their"] evil heart. Therefore, I brought on them all the words of this covenant which I commanded _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to do, and they did not _do it_.'" ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v9
And Yahweh said to me, "A conspiracy is found among the _people_ ^[Literally "man"] of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

###### v10
They have turned back to the iniquities of their former ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] who refused to obey my words, and they have gone after other gods, to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] with their ancestors." ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v11
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh, "I _am_ about to bring on them disaster from which they will not be able to escape. Though they cry out to me, yet I will not listen to them.

###### v12
Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods _to_ whom they _are_ making smoke offerings, but they will certainly not save them in the time of their trouble.

###### v13
For the number of your towns are your gods, _O_ Judah, and the number of the streets of Jerusalem _are the_ altars you have set up to the shameful things, to make smoke offerings to Baal.

###### v14
Therefore you must not pray for this people, and you must not lift up for them a cry of entreaty, or a prayer, for I _will_ not listen in the time of their calling to me, in the time of their trouble.

###### v15
_What rights has my beloved in my house_ ^[Literally "What for my beloved in my house"]
_when_ she has done many wicked things? ^[Hebrew "wicked thing"]
Can the flesh of holiness pass over you?
For _you engage in your wickedness_, ^[Literally "your wickedness"] then you exult.

###### v16
Yahweh called your name, 'A leafy olive tree, _beautiful with fine fruit_.' ^[Literally "beautiful of fruit of appearance"]
With the sound of a great storm he will set fire to it,
and its branches will be good for nothing.

###### v17
And Yahweh of hosts, the _one who_ planted you,
has spoken evil against you,
because of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah,
that they have done to themselves,
to provoke me to anger by making smoke offerings to Baal."

###### v18
Moreover, Yahweh let _it be_ made known to me, and I knew.
Then you showed me their deeds.

###### v19
And I _was_ like a gentle ram-lamb that is brought to slaughter,
and I did not know that they planned plans against me, _saying_,
"Let us destroy the tree with its fruit,
and let us cut him off from _the_ land of _the_ living,
so that his name will no longer be remembered."

###### v20
But _O_ Yahweh of hosts, who judges _in_ righteousness,
who tests _the_ _inmost being_, ^[Literally "kidney"] and _the_ _mind_, ^[Literally "heart"]
let me see your retribution upon them,
for to you I have revealed my legal case.

###### v21
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh concerning the people ^[Or "men"] of Anathoth who seek your life, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "You shall not prophesy in the name of Yahweh _or_ ^[Literally "and not"] you will die by our hand."

###### v22
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh of hosts: "Look, I _am about to_ punish them. The young men will die by the sword. Their sons and their daughters will die by the famine.

###### v23
And a remnant will not be _left_ for them, for I will bring disaster to the people ^[Or "men"] of Anathoth, the year of their punishment."
