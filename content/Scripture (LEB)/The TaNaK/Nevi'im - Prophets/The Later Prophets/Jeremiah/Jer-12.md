###### v1
You _will be_ in the right, _O_ Yahweh, when I complain to you.
Even so, let me speak _my_ claims with you.
Why does _the_ way of _the_ wicked succeed?
All those who deal treacherously with treachery are at ease.

###### v2
Not only do you plant them, they take root.
They grow, but also they produce fruit.
You _are_ near in their mouths,
but far from their _inmost beings_. ^[Literally "kidneys"]

###### v3
But you, _O_ Yahweh, you know me,
you see me, and you test _that_ my heart _is_ with you.
Tear them apart like sheep for _the_ slaughtering,
and set them apart for _the_ day of slaughter.

###### v4
_How long_ ^[Literally "Until when"] will the land mourn, and the vegetation of every field dry up,
because of the wickedness of those who live in it?
_The_ animals and _the_ birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] are swept away,
because they have said, "He does not see our future."

###### v5
"If you run with foot soldiers and they have made you weary,
then how will you compete with horses?
If you have fallen in _a peaceful land_, ^[Literally "a land of peace"]
then how will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?

###### v6
For even your relatives, and the house of your father,
even they have dealt treacherously with you,
even they call _loudly_ ^[Literally "full"] after you.
You must not trust in them, though they speak kindly to you.

###### v7
I have forsaken my house, I have abandoned my inheritance.
I have given the beloved one of my _heart_ ^[Literally "soul"] into the hand of her enemies.

###### v8
My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest.
She has lifted up against me her voice; _therefore_ ^[Literally "unto thus"] I hate her.

###### v9
The lair of _the_ hyena _is_ my inheritance to me,
the birds of prey ^[Hebrew "bird of prey"] _are_ all around her.
Go, gather all of the animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] of the field,
bring _them_ _to come and devour_. ^[Literally "to food"]

###### v10
Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard,
they have trampled down my plot of land.
They have made _my pleasant field_ ^[Literally "the plot of land of my desire"]
like the desert ^[Or "wilderness"] of desolation.

###### v11
They have made it a desolation.
Desolate, it mourns to me.
All the land is made desolate,
but there is no person taking _it_ to heart.

###### v12
Upon all _the_ barren heights in the desert ^[Or "wilderness"] destroyers have come,
for _the_ sword of Yahweh devours,
from _one_ end of _the_ land to the _other_ end of the land,
there is no peace for all flesh.

###### v13
They have sown wheat and they have reaped thorns.
They are exhausted, they do not profit.
And they will be ashamed of your produce,
because of _the burning anger_ ^[Literally "the blaze of the nose"] of Yahweh."

###### v14
Thus says Yahweh concerning all of the evil neighbors who touch the inheritance that I gave as an inheritance _to_ my people Israel: "Look, I _am_ about to drive them out from their land, and the house of Judah I will drive out from among them.

###### v15
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] after my driving them out, I will once again have compassion on them, and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance, and each one to his land.

###### v16
_And then_, ^[Literally "And it will happen"] if they diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, '_as Yahweh lives_,' ^[Literally "the life of Yahweh"] even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will live in the midst of my people.

###### v17
But if they do not listen, then _I will completely uproot and destroy that nation_." ^[Literally "I will drive out the nation that driving out and destroying"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh.
