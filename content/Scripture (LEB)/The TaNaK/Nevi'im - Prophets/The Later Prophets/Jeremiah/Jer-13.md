###### v1
Thus Yahweh said to me: "Go and buy for yourself a loincloth of linen and put it on your loins, but you must not _place_ ^[Literally "bring"] it in water."

###### v2
So I bought the loincloth according to the word of Yahweh and I put _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] on my loins.

###### v3
Now the word of Yahweh came to me a second _time_, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v4
"Take the loincloth that you bought, that _is_ on your loins, and stand up, go _to the_ Euphrates and hide it there in the cleft of the rock."

###### v5
So I went and hid it by _the_ Euphrates just as Yahweh had commanded me.

###### v6
_And then_, ^[Literally "And it happened"] _after a long time_, ^[Literally "from the end of many days"] then Yahweh said to me, "Stand up, go _to the_ Euphrates and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there."

###### v7
Then I went _to the_ Euphrates and I dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it, and look, the loincloth was ruined; it was not good for anything.

###### v8
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it happened"] the word of Yahweh came to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v9
"Thus says Yahweh: 'So I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.

###### v10
This evil people, who refuse to listen to my words, who go ^[Or "walk"] in the stubbornness of their hearts, ^[Hebrew "heart"] and have gone after other gods, to serve them, and to bow in worship to them, let them be like this loincloth which is not good for anything.

###### v11
For as the loincloth clings to _the_ loins of a person, so I caused to cling to me all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'to be for me a people, and a name, and a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.'

###### v12
"Therefore, you shall say to them this word, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: "Every jar must be filled with wine."' And they will say to you, 'Do we not certainly know that every jar should be filled with wine?'

###### v13
Then you shall say to them, 'Thus says Yahweh: "Look, I _am_ about to fill all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings who sit on David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem _with_ drunkenness.

###### v14
And I will smash them, each one against his brother, and the fathers and the sons together," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh. "I will not have compassion, and I will not take pity, and I will not show compassion from destroying them."'"

###### v15
Listen, and pay attention,
you must not be haughty, for Yahweh has spoken.

###### v16
Give glory to Yahweh your God _before_ ^[Literally "at not yet"] he brings darkness,
and _before_ ^[Literally "at not yet"] your feet stumble on the mountains at twilight.
And you will hope for light, but he makes it as gloom,
he makes _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] as thick darkness.

###### v17
But if you will not listen to it,
my inner self ^[Or "soul"] will weep in secret places,
because of _the presence of_ ^[Literally "the face of"] _your_ pride.
And my eyes ^[Hebrew "eye"] will weep bitterly,
and they will melt _in_ tears,
because the flock of Yahweh has been taken captive.

###### v18
"Say to the king and to the queen mother, '_Take a lower seat_, ^[Literally "Bring low sit"]
for _your beautiful crown_ ^[Literally "the crown of your beauty"] has come down from your head.' ^[Or "at the head of you"]

###### v19
The towns of the Negev are shut up,
and there is no _one who_ opens _them_. ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]
All of Judah is deported;
it is deported _in_ completeness.

###### v20
Lift up your eyes
and see those coming from _the_ north.
Where _is_ the flock that was given to you,
_your magnificent flock_? ^[Literally "the flock of your splendor"]

###### v21
What will you say when he sets over you--
and you have taught them--allies as head over you?
Will not labor pains take hold of you,
like a woman giving birth?

###### v22
And if you say in your heart,
'Why have these _things_ happened to me?'
Because of the greatness of your iniquity your skirts are uncovered;
your heels have endured violence.

###### v23
Can a Cushite change his skin,
or a leopard his spots?
_Then_ you also will be able to do good,
_who_ are accustomed to doing evil.

###### v24
And I will scatter them
like stubble scattered by _the_ wind of _the_ desert. ^[Or "wilderness"]

###### v25
This _is_ your lot,
the portion of your measure from me," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"because you have forgotten me,
and you have trusted in the lie.

###### v26
So in turn I will bare your skirts over your face,
and your shame will become visible.

###### v27
Your adulteries, and your neighings,
the shameful behavior of your fornications
on _the_ hills in the countryside,
I have seen your abominations.
Woe to you, _O_ Jerusalem!
_How long will you continue to be unclean_? ^[Literally "Not you are clean after how long still"]"
