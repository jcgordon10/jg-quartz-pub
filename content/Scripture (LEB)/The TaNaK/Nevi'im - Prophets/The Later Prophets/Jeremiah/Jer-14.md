###### v1
_That_ which came _as_ the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah concerning the matter ^[Hebrew "matters"] of the severe drought.

###### v2
"Judah mourns, and her gates languish,
they are in mourning on the ground,
and the cry of lament of Jerusalem goes up.

###### v3
And their nobles send their servants for water.
They come to _the_ pits, they find no water.
They return _with_ their vessels _empty_. ^[Literally "without success"]
They are ashamed, and they are confounded,
and they cover their heads. ^[Hebrew "head"]

###### v4
Because of the ground, _which_ is cracked
because there was no rain on the ground.
_The_ farmers are ashamed,
they cover their heads. ^[Hebrew "head"]

###### v5
For even _the_ doe in the field gives birth and forsakes _her young_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]
because there is no green growth.

###### v6
And wild asses stand on _the_ barren heights,
they gasp _for_ breath like the jackals.
Their eyes fail
because there is no vegetation."

###### v7
Although our iniquities testify against us, _O_ Yahweh,
act for the sake of your name.
Yes, our apostasies are many;
we have sinned against you.

###### v8
_You are_ the hope of Israel,
its savior in time of distress.
Why should you be like an alien in the land,
or like a traveler who spreads out _his tent_  ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] to spend the night?

###### v9
Why should you be like a confused man,
like a warrior _who_ is not able to help?
Yet you _are_ in our midst, _O_ Yahweh,
and your name is called upon us.
You must not leave us!

###### v10
Thus says Yahweh concerning this people:
"They have loved so much to wander,
they have not spared their feet.
Therefore Yahweh is not favorable to them,
now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins."

###### v11
So Yahweh said to me, "You must not pray for this people, for _their_ happiness. ^[Or "good"]

###### v12
Although they fast, I _am_ not listening to their cry of entreaty. And although they present burnt offering and grain offering, I _am_ not favorable to them. But by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague, I _am_ about to destroy them."

###### v13
Then I said, "Ah, Lord Yahweh, look, the prophets _are_ saying to them, 'You will not see _the_ sword, and famine will not be yours, but reliable peace I will give to you in this place.'"

###### v14
And Yahweh said to me, "The prophets _are_ prophesying lies ^[Hebrew "lie"] in my name. I have not sent them, and I have not commanded them, and I have not spoken to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, and a divination, worthless, and the deceitfulness of their _minds_." ^[Literally "heart"]

###### v15
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who prophecy in my name though I have not sent them, yet they _are_ saying, "Sword and famine will not be in this land." "By the sword and by the famine those prophets will perish.

###### v16
And the people _to_ whom they _are_ prophesying will be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem _because of_ ^[Literally "from the face of"] the famine and the sword. And there will be no _one who_ buries them, their wives, or their sons, or their daughters. And I will pour out on them their wickedness.

###### v17
"And you shall say to them this word,
'Let my eyes melt _with_ tears night and day,
and let them not cease,
for _with_ a great wound the virgin daughter of my people is broken,
_with_ a very incurable wound.

###### v18
If I go out _into_ the field,
then look, those slain by _the_ sword.
And if I enter the city,
then look, the sickness of _the_ famine.
For both prophet and priest wander around through the land,
_they do not know what is going on_.'" ^[Literally "and not they know"]

###### v19
Have you completely rejected Judah?
Or has your soul ^[Or "inner self"] loathed Zion?
Why have you struck us
so that there is no healing for us?
We hope for peace, but there is no good,
and for a time of healing, but look, there is terror.

###### v20
We know, _O_ Yahweh, our wickedness,
the iniquity of our ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"]
for we have sinned against you.

###### v21
You must not spurn _us_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] for the sake of your name,
you must not dishonor _your glorious throne_. ^[Literally "the throne of your glory"]
Remember _us_! ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]
You must not break your covenant with us.

###### v22
Are there _any_ among the idols of the nation _who_ cause rain to pour?
Or can the heavens give showers?
_Is_ it not you, _O_ Yahweh our God?
Therefore, we hope in you, for you do all these _things_.
