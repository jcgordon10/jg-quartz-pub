###### v2
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] if they say to you, 'Where shall we go?' Then you shall say to them, 'Thus says Yahweh,

and _those_ who _are destined_ for the famine, to the famine,
and _those_ who _are destined_ for the captivity, to the captivity."'

Their widows ^[Hebrew "widow"] will be more numerous before me than _the_ sand of _the_ seas.

I will suddenly drop on her anguish and horror. ^[Hebrew "horrors"]

###### v9
She who gave birth to seven has withered away.
She gasps her breath.
Her sun _set_ ^[Literally "came"] while still day.
She has been put to shame and disgraced.

_before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] their enemies," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v10
Woe to me, _O_ my mother, that you gave birth to me,
a man of contention and quarreling _to the whole land_. ^[Literally "to all of the land"]

"_Surely_ ^[Literally "If not"] I will set you free _to be good_ ^[Literally "for good"] for you,

You must take me away.

###### v16

and your words became to me as jubilation,
even as the joy of my heart,
for your name is called on me, _O_ Yahweh God of hosts.

###### v17

Because of the _presence_ ^[Literally "face"] of your hand I sat alone,
for you filled me _with_ indignation.

"If you turn back, then I will take you back.
You will stand _before me_. ^[Literally "to the face of me"]
