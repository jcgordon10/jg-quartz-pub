###### v1
And the word of Yahweh came to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"You shall not take for yourself a wife, there shall not be for you sons and daughters in this place."

###### v3
For thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning the daughters born in this place, and concerning their mothers who gave birth to them, and concerning their fathers who fathered them in this land:

###### v4
"They will die by diseases, they will not be mourned, and they will not be buried. They will be as dung on the face of the earth. And they will perish by the sword and they will perish by the famine. And their dead bodies ^[Hebrew "dead body"] will become food for the birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of the air, and for the wild animals ^[Hebrew "wild animal"] of the earth."

###### v5
For thus says Yahweh, "You must not enter _the_ house of _the_ funeral meal, and you must not go to lament, and you must not show sympathy for them, for I have taken away my peace from this people," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "the loyal love and the compassion.

###### v6
Both the great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried, and they will not mourn for them, and no one will cut himself with a blade, and no one will shave himself for them.

###### v7
And they will not break bread for _the_ mourning ceremony for them, to comfort him because of _the_ dead. And they will not give drink to them, _the_ cup of desolation, for their fathers, ^[Hebrew "father"] or for their mothers. ^[Hebrew "mother"]

###### v8
And you shall not enter _the_ house of _the_ banquet, to sit with them, to eat and drink."

###### v9
For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, "Look, I _am_ about to cause to disappear from this place, before your eyes and in your days, _the_ voice of jubilation, and _the_ voice of joy, and _the_ voice of _the_ bridegroom, and _the_ voice of _the_ bride.

###### v10
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] when you tell this people all these words and they ask you, '_Why_ ^[Literally "On what"] has Yahweh pronounced against us all this great evil, and what _is_ our iniquity, and what _is_ our sin that we have sinned against Yahweh our God?'

###### v11
Then you shall say to them, '_Because_ ^[Literally "On that"] your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] have forsaken me,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'and they have gone after other gods, and they have served them, and they have bowed down in worship to them, and they have forsaken me, and they have not kept my laws.

###### v12
And _you have behaved badly_ ^[Literally "you have done evil to do"] more than your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] and look, you _are_ going each one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, without listening to me.

###### v13
So I will throw you from this land to the land that you have not known, you or your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will not show you favor.

###### v14
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] look, days _are_ coming,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'and it will no longer be said, "_As Yahweh lives_, ^[Literally "The life of Yahweh"] who led up the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] from the land of Egypt,"

###### v15
_but only_ ^[Literally "but if"] "_As Yahweh lives_, ^[Literally "The life of Yahweh"] who led up the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] from _the_ land of _the_ north, and from all the lands where he had driven them," for I will bring them back to their ground that I gave to their ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v16
Look, I _am_ sending for many fishermen,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'and they will fish them out, and _afterward_ ^[Literally "after thus"] I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and from the clefts of the cliffs.

###### v17
For my eyes _are_ on all their ways, they are not hidden _from before me_, ^[Literally "from to the face of me"] and their iniquity is not concealed from before my eyes.

###### v18
And _I will first doubly repay_ ^[Literally "I will reward first second"] their iniquity and their sin because of their profaning my land with the dead bodies ^[Hebrew "dead body"] of their abhorrences, and _with_ their abominations they have filled up my inheritance.'"

###### v19
_O_ Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold,
and my refuge in _the_ day of distress,
to you _the_ nations will come from the ends of _the_ earth,
and they will say, "Our ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] have inherited only lies, ^[Hebrew "lie"]
vanity, and there is no profit in them.

###### v20
Can a human make for himself gods?
Yet they _are_ not gods!"

###### v21
"_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] look, I _am_ about to let them know,
this time I am going to let them know
my _power_ ^[Literally "hand"] and my might,
and they will know that my name _is_ Yahweh."
