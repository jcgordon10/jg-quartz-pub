###### v1
"The sin of Judah _is_ written with an iron stylus,
with a point of diamond _it is_ engraved
on the tablet of their heart,
and on the horns of their altars.

###### v2
As the remembering of their children,
_so is the remembering of_ their altars
and their poles of Asherah worship
beside _the_ leafy trees ^[Hebrew "tree"] on _the_ high hills.

###### v3
_O_ my mountain in the open country,
I will give your wealth, all your treasures, for spoil,
your high places, because of _your_ sin,
throughout all your territories.

###### v4
And _you will let go your hand from your inheritance_ ^[Literally "you shall loose and in you from your inheritance"]
that I gave to you,
and I will make you serve your enemies
in the land that you do not know,
for you kindled a fire in my anger,
until eternity it will be kindled."

###### v5
Thus says Yahweh,
"Cursed _is_ the person who trusts in humankind
and makes flesh his _strength_, ^[Literally "arm"]
and turns aside his heart from Yahweh.

###### v6
And he will be like a juniper in the wilderness, ^[Or "Arabah"]
and he will not see when good comes,
and he will dwell _in the_ parched places in the desert, ^[Or "wilderness"]
_in_ a land of salt flats, ^[Hebrew "salt flat"] where no one lives.

###### v7
Blessed be the person who trusts in Yahweh,
and Yahweh is his trust.

###### v8
For he will be like a tree planted by water,
and to _the_ stream it sends its roots,
and it will not fear when heat comes,
and its leaves ^[Hebrew "leaf"] will be luxuriant,
and in _the_ year of drought it will not be anxious,
and it will not cease from the bearing of fruit.

###### v9
The heart _is_ deceitful more than anything else,
and it _is_ disastrous. Who can understand it?

###### v10
I, Yahweh, examine _the_ _mind_, ^[Literally "heart"]
_I_ test _the_ _heart_, ^[Literally "kidneys"]
and give to each one according to his way,
according to the fruit of his deeds.

###### v11
_Like_ a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay
_is_ one who amasses wealth without justice.
In the middle of his days it will leave him,
and at his end he will _prove to_ be a fool."

###### v12
A lofty throne of glory from the beginning
_is_ the place of our sanctuary.

###### v13
_O_ Yahweh, the hope of Israel,
all _those who_ forsake you will be put to shame,
and _those who_ turn aside from you in the earth will be recorded,
for they have forsaken the fountain of living water, Yahweh.

###### v14
Heal me, _O_ Yahweh, and I will be healed,
save me, and I will be saved,
for you _are_ my praise.

###### v15
Look, they _are_ saying to me,
"Where _is_ the word of Yahweh?
Please let it come."

###### v16
But I, I have not run away from being a shepherd _who follows you_, ^[Literally "after you"]
and I have not desired the disastrous day.
You, you know the pronouncement of my lips,
it was before your face.

###### v17
You must not become to me a terror,
you _are_ my refuge in _the_ day of disaster.

###### v18
Let my persecutors be put to shame,
_but as for me_, ^[Literally "I"] _do_ not let me be put to shame.
Let them be dismayed,
_but as for me_, ^[Literally "I"] _do_ not let me be dismayed.
Bring on them the day of disaster,
and _with_ double destruction, destroy them.

###### v19
Thus said Yahweh to me, "Go, and you must stand in the _People's Gate_ ^[Literally "gate of the sons/children of the people"] through which the kings of Judah enter, and through which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem.

###### v20
And you must say to them, 'Hear the word of Yahweh, kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem who enter through these gates.

###### v21
Thus says Yahweh, "Be on your guard for the sake of yourselves, that you must not carry a burden on the day of the Sabbath, and you must _not_ bring _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] through the gates of Jerusalem.

###### v22
And you must not carry a burden from your houses on the day of the Sabbath, and you must not do any work. But you must declare holy the day of Sabbath, just as I commanded your ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v23
Yet they did not listen, and they did not incline their ear, and they hardened their neck _so as_ to not hear, nor to receive discipline.

###### v24
"And it will happen, if you carefully listen to me," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "to bring no burden through the gates of this city on the day of the Sabbath, but to declare holy the day of Sabbath, not to do on it any work,

###### v25
then kings and officials who sit on the throne of David will enter through the gates of this city riding in chariots ^[Hebrew "chariot"] and on horses, they, and their officials, the people of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited _forever_. ^[Literally "to eternity"]

###### v26
And they will come from the towns of Judah, and from all around Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the Shephelah, and from the hill country, and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings, ^[Hebrew "burnt offering"] and sacrifices, ^[Hebrew "sacrifice"] and grain offerings, ^[Hebrew "grain offering"] and frankincense, and bringing thank offerings ^[Hebrew "thank offering"] _to_ the house of Yahweh.

###### v27
But if you do not listen to me, to declare holy the day of the Sabbath, and to not carry a burden and enter through the gates of Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it will not be quenched."'"
