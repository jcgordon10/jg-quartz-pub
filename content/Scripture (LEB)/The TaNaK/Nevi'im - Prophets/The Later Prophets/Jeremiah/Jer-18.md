###### v1
The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Stand up and go down _to_ the house of the potter, and there I will let you hear my words."

###### v3
So I went down _to_ the house of the potter and look, there he was doing work at the potter's wheels.

###### v4
And the vessel that he _was_ making with the clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter, so _he made again_ ^[Literally "he turned back and he made it"] another vessel, as it was right in the eyes of the potter to make.

###### v5
And the word of Yahweh came to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v6
"Like this potter, am I not able to do to you, O house of Israel?" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh. "Look, like the clay in the hand of the potter, so _are_ you in my hand, O house of Israel.

###### v7
One moment I speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom, to uproot, and to tear down, and to destroy _it_. ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v8
But _if_ that nation turns back from its evil that I have threatened against it, then I will relent concerning the disaster that I planned to do to it.

###### v9
And the _next_ moment I speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom, to build, and to plant _it_. ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v10
But _if_ it does evil in my sight, to not listen to my voice, then I will relent concerning the good that I said I would do _to_ it.

###### v11
"So now then, say, please, to the _people_ ^[Literally "man"] of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Thus says Yahweh, "Look, I _am_ preparing evil against you, and _I am_ planning a plan against you. Please turn back, each one from his evil way, and walk rightly _in_ your ways and your deeds."'

###### v12
But they will say, '_It is_ hopeless, for we will go after our _own_ plans, and each one of us will act _according to_ the stubbornness of his evil heart.'

###### v13
"Therefore thus says Yahweh,
'Please ask among the nations, "Who has heard _the like of this_?" ^[Literally "like these"]
The virgin of Israel has done something very horrible.

###### v14
Does the snow of Lebanon leave from _the_ crags ^[Hebrew "crag"] of Sirion?
Or are _the_ cold waters flowing from distant mountains dried up?

###### v15
But my people have forgotten me.
They make smoke offerings to the idols, ^[Hebrew "idol"]
and they caused them to stumble in their ways, _the_ ancient ways,
to go _into_ _bypaths_, ^[Literally "paths of way"] not _one that_ is built up.

###### v16
To make their land a horror,
_an object of_ whistling for eternity.
All _who_ pass by it will be appalled,
and he will shake his head.

###### v17
Like the wind from the east
I will scatter them _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] _the_ enemy.
I will show them _my_ back and not _my_ face
in the day of their disaster.'"

###### v18
Then they said, "Come and let us plan plans against Jeremiah, for instruction will not be lost from _the_ priest, nor advice from _the_ wise man, nor _the_ word from _the_ prophet. Come and _let us bring charges against him_, ^[Literally "let us strike him with the tongue"] and let us not listen attentively to any of his words."

###### v19
Listen attentively to me, _O_ Yahweh,
and listen to _the_ voice of my opponents.

###### v20
Should good be repaid in place of evil?
Yet they have dug a pit for me.
Remember my standing _before you_ ^[Literally "to the face of you"] to speak good for them,
to avert your wrath from them.

###### v21
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] give their children to the famine,
and hand them over to _the_ _power_ ^[Literally "hand"] of _the_ sword,
and let their wives be bereaved and widows,
and let their men be killed by death,
their young men struck dead
_by the_ sword in the battle.

###### v22
Let a cry for help be heard from their houses
when you suddenly bring upon them _the_ raiding band,
for they have dug a pit to catch me,
and they have fixed secretly a trap for my feet.

###### v23
But you, _O_ Yahweh, you know
_all their plans of assassination against me_. ^[Literally "all of their plan against me to the death"]
You must not make atonement for their iniquity,
and you must not cause their sin to be blotted out from _before you_. ^[Literally "to the face of you"]
But let them be overthrown _before you_. ^[Literally "to the face of you"]
Deal with them in the time of your anger.
