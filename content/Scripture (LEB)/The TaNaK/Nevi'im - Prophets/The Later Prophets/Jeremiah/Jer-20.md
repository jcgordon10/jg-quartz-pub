###### v1
Now Pashhur, the son of Immer, the priest _who was_ officer in charge in the temple of Yahweh, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.

###### v2
Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that _were_ in the upper Gate of Benjamin, which _was_ by the temple of Yahweh.

###### v3
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it was"] on the next day, when Pashhur brought Jeremiah out from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, "Yahweh will not call your name Pashhur, _but_ ^[Literally "but if"] Terror From All Around.

###### v4
For thus says Yahweh, 'Look, I _am_ making you a terror to yourself and to all your friends, and they will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes _will be_ seeing _it_. ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] And all Judah I will give into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will deport them _to_ Babylon, and he will strike them with the sword.

###### v5
And I will give all the wealth of this city, and all its acquisitions, and all its precious items, and all of the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies, and they will plunder them, and they will seize them, and they will bring them _to_ Babylon.

###### v6
And you, Pashhur, and all _those who_ live _in_ your house will go into captivity, and you will go _to_ Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried, you, and all your friends to whom you have prophesied _falsely_. ^[Literally "in the lie"]'"

###### v7
You have persuaded me, _O_ Yahweh, and I was persuaded.
You have overpowered me, and you have prevailed.
I have become a laughingstock all day _long_.
_Everyone_ ^[Literally "All of him"] _is_ mocking me.

###### v8
For _as often as_ ^[Literally "from enough"] I speak,
I must cry out violence and destruction.
I must shout, for the word of Yahweh has become for me
a disgrace and derision all day _long_.

###### v9
But _if_ I say, "I will not mention him
and I will no longer speak in his name,"
then it becomes in my heart like a fire burning,
locked up in my bones,
and I struggle to contain _it_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]
and I am not able.

###### v10
For I hear the rumor of many,
"Terror _is_ from all around, denounce _him_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]
yes, let us denounce him!"
_All my close friends_ ^[Literally "All the human being of my peace"] _are_ watchers of my stumbling,
_saying_, "perhaps he can be persuaded,
and we can prevail over him,
and we can take our revenge on him."

###### v11
But Yahweh _is_ with me like a powerful warrior.
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "Unto thus"] my persecutors will stumble and will not prevail.
They will be very ashamed, for they will not achieve success.
_Their_ _everlasting insult_ ^[Literally "insult of eternity"] will not be forgotten.

###### v12
Yet, _O_ Yahweh of hosts, who tests _the_ righteous,
who sees _the_ _heart_ ^[Literally "kidneys"] and _the_ _mind_, ^[Literally "heart"]
let me see your retribution upon them,
for to you I have revealed my legal case.

###### v13
Sing to Yahweh, praise Yahweh,
for he has delivered _the_ life of _the_ poor from _the_ hand of evildoers.

###### v14
Cursed be _the_ day _on_ which I was born,
let not the day _on_ which my mother gave birth to me be blessed.

###### v15
Cursed be the man who brought the news _to_ my father,
_saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "A child is born to you, a son!"
and he made him very glad.

###### v16
And let that man be like the cities
that Yahweh demolished without regret,
and let him hear a cry for help in the morning,
and an alarm at the time of noon.

###### v17
Because he did not kill me in _the_ womb,
so that my mother would have been for me my grave,
and _her_ womb _would be_ pregnant forever.

###### v18
_Why_ ^[Literally "To what this"] did I come out from _the_ womb,
to see toil, and sorrow, and _to_ _end my days in shame_? ^[Literally "my days will come to an end in shame"]
