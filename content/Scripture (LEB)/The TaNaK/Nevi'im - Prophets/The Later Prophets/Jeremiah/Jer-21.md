###### v1
The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur, the son of Malchiah, and Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Please inquire _of_ Yahweh on behalf of us, for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon _is_ fighting against us. Perhaps Yahweh will do with us according to all his miraculous acts, so that he may go up from against us."

###### v3
Then Jeremiah said to them, "Thus you shall say to Zedekiah:

###### v4
'Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: "Look, I _am_ about to turn back the weapons of war that _are_ in your hands, ^[Hebrew "hand"] _with_ which you _are_ fighting against them, the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are laying siege to you from outside the wall, and I will gather them into the center of this city.

###### v5
And I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand, and with strong arm, and in _anger_, ^[Literally "nose"] and in fury, and in great wrath.

###### v6
And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both humankind and animal; by a great plague they will die.

###### v7
And _afterward_," ^[Literally "after thus"] _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "I will give Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and those who remain in this city from the plague, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their lives, and he will strike them with _the_ _edge_ ^[Literally "mouth"] of _the_ sword. He will not take pity on them, and he will not have compassion, nor will he show compassion."'

###### v8
"And to this people you shall say, 'Thus says Yahweh, "Look, I _am_ setting _before you_ ^[Literally "to the face of you"] the way of life and the way of death.

###### v9
He who stays in this city will die by the sword, or by the famine, or by the plague. And he who goes out and goes over to the Chaldeans who are laying siege to you will live, and his life will be to him as booty.

###### v10
For I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh. It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire."'

###### v11
"And to the house of the king of Judah, 'Hear the word of Yahweh,

###### v12
O house of David, thus says Yahweh,
"Execute judgment in the morning, justice,
and deliver _the_ one who has been seized
from _the_ hand of _the_ oppressor,
lest my wrath goes forth like the fire and it burns,
and there is no _one who_ quenches _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]
because of the evil of your deeds.

###### v13
Look, I _am_ against you,
O inhabitants ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"] of the valley,
O rock of the plain," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh;
"you who say, 'Who can descend against us,
or who can enter into our hiding place?'

###### v14
And I will punish you
according to the fruit of your deeds," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"And I will kindle a fire in its forest,
and it will devour all its surroundings."'"
