###### v1
Thus says Yahweh: "Go down _to_ the house of the king of Judah and you must speak this word there.

###### v2
And you must say, 'Hear the word of Yahweh, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter through these gates.

###### v3
Thus says Yahweh, "Act _with_ justice and righteousness, and deliver _the_ one who has been seized from the hand of _the_ oppressor. And you must not oppress _the_ immigrant, _the_ orphan, and _the_ widow. And you must not shed innocent blood in this place.

###### v4
And if you indeed obey this word, then kings who sit for David on his throne will enter through the gates of this house, riding in chariots ^[Hebrew "chariot"] and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.

###### v5
But if you do not obey these words, I swear by myself," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "that this house will become a site of ruins."'"

###### v6
For thus says Yahweh concerning the house of the king of Judah,
"You _are like_ Gilead to me,
_like_ the head of the Lebanon.
_Surely_ ^[Literally "If not"] I will make you a desert, ^[Or "wilderness"]
_like_ cities _that_ are not inhabited.

###### v7
And I will consecrate against you destroyers,
everyone with his weapons,
and they will cut down _your choicest cedars_, ^[Literally "the choicest thing of your cedars"]
and cast _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] on the fire.

###### v8
And many nations will pass by this city and they will say each one to his neighbor, '_Why_ ^[Literally "Over what"] has Yahweh done in this manner to this great city?'

###### v9
Then they will answer, 'Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God, and bowed down in worship to other gods, and served them.'"

###### v10
You must not weep for _the_ dead person,
and you must not show sympathy for him.
Weep bitterly for the one who goes away,
for he will not return, or see the land of his birth again.

###### v11
For thus says Yahweh concerning Shallum, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, who reigned as king in place of Josiah his father, who went out from this place: "He will not return here again.

###### v12
But in _the_ place where they have deported him, there he will die, and he will not see this land again.

###### v13
Woe _to the one who_ builds his house without righteousness,
and his upper rooms without justice.
His fellow countryman, he works for nothing,
and he does not give to him his wages. ^[Hebrew "wage"]

###### v14
Who says 'I will build for myself
a spacious house with large upper rooms,'
and he cuts windows for it,
and _it is_ ^[Here the subject is supplied from context in the English translation] paneled with cedar,
and he paints _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] with vermilion.

###### v15
Do you reign as king because you _are_ competing in cedar?
Did not your father eat and drink,
and he did justice and righteousness,
then it was well with him?

###### v16
He judged _the_ legal cause of _the_ needy and _the_ poor,
_and_ then it was well.
_Is that not what it means to know me_? ^[Literally "Not that the knowledge me"]" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v17
"But there is nothing _in_ your eyes and your heart
_except_ ^[Literally "but if"] your unlawful gain,
and on shedding the blood of the innocent,
and on committing oppression and extortion."

###### v18
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah:
"They will not lament for him,
'Alas, my brother,' or 'Alas, sister.'
They will not lament for him,
'Alas, lord,' or 'alas, his majesty.'

###### v19
He will be buried _with_ the burial of a donkey.
_He will be_ ^[Here the subject is supplied from context in the English translation] dragged away and thrown _outside_ ^[Literally "from beyond"] the gates of Jerusalem.

###### v20
Go up _to_ Lebanon and cry out,
and in Bashan lift up your voice,
and cry out from Abarim,
for all your lovers are shattered.

###### v21
I spoke to you _in the times you were secure_, ^[Literally "in your security"]
_and_ you said, 'I will not listen!'
This _was_ your way from your youth,
for you have not obeyed my voice.

###### v22
All your shepherds will shepherd _the_ wind,
and your lovers will go into captivity.
Yes, then you will be ashamed and humiliated
because of all your wickedness.

###### v23
Inhabitants ^[Hebrew "Inhabitant"] of Lebanon,
nestled among the cedars,
how you will groan when labor pains come to you,
fear and pain as the _woman who_ gives birth.

###### v24
"As I live," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "surely if Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were _the_ seal on my right hand, surely from there I would wrench you off.

###### v25
And I would give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of those from whom you _are_ frightened by their presence, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.

###### v26
And I will throw you and your mother who gave birth to you to another country where you were not born, and there you will die.

###### v27
As for the land to which they are _longing_ ^[Literally "lifting their inner self"] to return, they will not return.

###### v28
_Is_ this man Coniah a despised, shattered vessel?
Or a vessel _in which_ there is no delight?
Why are he and his offspring thrown far,
and cast away to the land that they do not know?"

###### v29
_O_ land, land, land, hear the word of Yahweh.

###### v30
Thus says Yahweh:
"Record this man _as_ childless,
a man _who_ will not succeed in his days,
for no man from his offspring will succeed _him_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]
sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah."
