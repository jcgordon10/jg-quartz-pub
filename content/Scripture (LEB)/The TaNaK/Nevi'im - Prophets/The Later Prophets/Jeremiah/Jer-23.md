"Woe _to the_ shepherds who destroy and scatter the flock of my pasture," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v2
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people, "You yourselves have scattered my flock, and you have driven them away, and you do not attend to them. Look, I _will_ punish you _for_ the evil of your deeds," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v3
"Then I myself will gather together the remnant of my flock from all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their grazing place, and they will be fruitful, and they will become numerous.

###### v4
And I will raise up over them shepherds, and they will shepherd them, and they will no longer fear, and they will not be dismayed, and they will not be missing," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v5
"Look, days _are_ coming," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"when I will raise up for David a righteous branch,
and he will reign _as_ king, and he will achieve success,
and he will do justice and righteousness in the land.

###### v6
In his days Judah will be saved,
and Israel will dwell _in safety_, ^[Literally "with confidence"]
and this _is_ his name _by_ which he will be called:
'Yahweh _is_ our righteousness.'

###### v7
"_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] look, days _are_ coming," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "when they will no longer say, '_As Yahweh lives_, ^[Literally "the life of Yahweh"] who led up the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] from the land of Egypt,'

###### v8
but '_As Yahweh lives_, ^[Literally "the life of Yahweh"] who led up, and who brought the offspring of the house of Israel from _the_ land _of the_ north and from all the lands where he had driven them.' Then they will live in their land."

###### v9
Concerning the prophets:
My heart is broken in my midst.
All my bones tremble.
I have become like a drunken man,
even like a man over whom wine has passed,
because of Yahweh,
and because of _his holy words_. ^[Literally "words of his holiness"]

###### v10
For the land is full _of_ adulterers;
for the land mourns because of a curse.
_The_ pastures of _the_ desert ^[Or "wilderness"] are dry,
and their evil has been their way of running,
and their power _is_ not right.

###### v11
"For both prophet as well as priest are godless,
even in my temple I have found their wickedness," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v12
"_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] their way will be to them like the slippery places,
they will be pushed in the darkness,
and they will fall into it,
for I will bring disaster on them _in_ the year of their punishment," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v13
"Now in the prophets of Samaria I saw a disgusting thing.
They prophesied by Baal and they caused my people Israel to err.

###### v14
And in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible.
They commit adultery, and they walk in lies, ^[Hebrew "the lie"]
and they make strong _the_ hands of evildoers,
_so_ that they have not turned back each from his wickedness.
All of them have become to me like Sodom,
and its inhabitants like Gomorrah."

###### v15
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets,
"Look, I _am_ going to let them eat wormwood
and I will give them water of poison to drink,
for from the prophets of Jerusalem
went out ungodliness to all the land."

###### v16
Thus says Yahweh of hosts,
"You must not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you.
They _are_ deluding you _with_ visions of their _mind_, ^[Literally "heart"]
They do not speak from the mouth of Yahweh.

###### v17
_They are_ ^[Here the subject and verb are supplied from context in the English translation] continually saying to those who disregard the word of Yahweh,
'Peace it will be to you,'
and _to_ _each one_ ^[Literally "all"] who walks in the stubbornness of his heart they say,
'Calamity will not come upon you.'

###### v18
For who has stood in the council of Yahweh,
that he has seen and heard his word?
Who has listened attentively _to_ his word
and heard _it_? ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v19
Look, the storm of Yahweh has gone forth _in_ wrath,
even a whirling tempest.
It will whirl upon _the_ head of _the_ wicked.

###### v20
The _anger_ ^[Literally "nose"] of Yahweh will not turn back
until his doing and until his keeping the plans of his _mind_. ^[Literally "heart"]
_In latter days_ ^[Literally "In the last of the days"] you will look closely at it _with_ understanding.

###### v21
I have not sent the prophets, yet they ran.
I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.

###### v22
But if they had stood in my council,
then they would have proclaimed my words _to_ my people,
and they would have caused them to turn from their evil way,
and from the evil of their deeds.

###### v23
_Am_ I a God from near," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and not a God from far?

###### v24
Or can a person hide himself in secret places
and I cannot see him?" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.
"_Do_ I not fill up the heaven and the earth?" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v25
"I have heard what the prophets who prophesy lies ^[Hebrew "lie"] have said in my name, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'I have dreamed! I have dreamed!'

###### v26
_How long_ ^[Literally "Until when"] _will_ this be in the hearts ^[Hebrew "heart"] of the prophets who prophesy lies, ^[Hebrew "the lie"] even the prophets of the deceitfulness of their hearts, ^[Hebrew "heart"]

###### v27
who plan to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell each one to his neighbor, just as their ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] forgot my name through Baal?

###### v28
The prophet who _has_ with him a dream, let him tell _the_ dream. But _the prophet_ ^[Here the subject is supplied from context in the English translation] who _has_ my word with him, let him speak my word faithfully. _What is straw compared to wheat_?" ^[Literally "What to the straw in comparison with the wheat"] _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v29
"_Is_ not my word like fire?" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "and like a blacksmith's hammer _that_ breaks a rock into pieces?

###### v30
"_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] look, I _am_ against the prophets," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "who steal my words each one from his neighbor.

###### v31
Look, I _am_ against the prophets," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "who take their tongues ^[Hebrew "tongue"] and declare as prophets, '_Yahweh_ _declares_.' ^[Literally "a declaration of"]

###### v32
Look, I _am_ against those who prophesy dreams of lies," ^[Hebrew "lie"] _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "and tell them, and they caused my people to err through their lies, and in their recklessness, when I myself have not sent them nor commanded them, so they profit not this people at all," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v33
"Now when this people, or a prophet, or a priest, ask you, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'What _is_ the burden ^[Or "oracle"] of Yahweh?' then you shall say to them, '_You are the burden_, ^[Literally "What burden"] and I will forsake you,'" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v34
"And the prophet, and the priest, and the people who say, 'The burden ^[Or "oracle"] of Yahweh,' I will punish that man and his house.

###### v35
Thus you shall say, each one to his neighbor and each one to his brother: 'What has Yahweh answered?' or, 'What has Yahweh spoken?'

###### v36
But you shall not mention the burden ^[Or "oracle"] of Yahweh, for the burden ^[Or "oracle"] is to each one his word, and so you twist the words of _the_ living God, Yahweh of hosts, our God.

###### v37
Thus you shall say to that prophet, 'What has Yahweh answered you?' or, 'What has Yahweh spoken?'

###### v38
But if you say, 'The burden ^[Or "oracle"] of Yahweh,' _therefore_ ^[Literally "to thus"] thus says Yahweh, 'because of your saying these words, ^[Hebrew "word"] "The burden ^[Or "oracle"] of Yahweh," then I will send to you, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "You shall not say, 'The burden ^[Or "oracle"] of Yahweh.'"'

###### v39
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] look, here I am, and I will surely lift you up and forsake you and the city that I gave to you and to your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] from _my presence_ ^[Literally "my face"],

###### v40
and I will bring upon you _an everlasting disgrace_ ^[Literally "a disgrace of eternity"] and _an everlasting shame_ ^[Literally "a shame of eternity"] that will not be forgotten."
