[[Jer-23|Previous Chapter]] | [[Jer-25|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Yahweh showed me, and look, there were two baskets of figs placed _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the temple of Yahweh--after Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had deported Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, with the officials of Judah, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, ^[Hebrew "smith"] from Jerusalem and had brought them _to_ Babylon.

###### v2
The one basket _had_ very good figs, like _early figs_, ^[Literally "the figs of the early ripened fruit"] and the other basket _had_ very bad figs that could not be eaten because of _their_ bad quality.

###### v3
And Yahweh asked me, "What _are_ you seeing, Jeremiah?" And I said, "Figs--the good figs, very good, and the bad _figs_, very bad, that cannot be eaten because of _their_ bad quality."

###### v4
Then the word of Yahweh came to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v5
"Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles ^[Hebrew "exile"] of Judah whom I have sent away from this place _to the_ land of _the_ Chaldeans.

###### v6
For I will set my eyes ^[Hebrew "eye"] on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. And I will build them and not annihilate _them_, and I will plant them and not uproot _them_.

###### v7
And I will give to them a heart to know me, that I _am_ Yahweh, and _they will be my people_, ^[Literally "they shall be for me as a people"] and _I will be their God_, ^[Literally "I will be for them as God"] for they will return to me with the whole of their heart.

###### v8
But like the bad figs that cannot be eaten because of _their_ bad quality--for thus says Yahweh--so I will treat Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who live in the land of Egypt.

###### v9
And I will make them as a terror, an evil to all the kingdoms of the earth, as a disgrace and a proverb, as a taunt and a curse, in all the places where I will drive them.

###### v10
And I will send among them the sword, the famine, and the plague, until they perish from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.'" ^[Or "fathers"]
