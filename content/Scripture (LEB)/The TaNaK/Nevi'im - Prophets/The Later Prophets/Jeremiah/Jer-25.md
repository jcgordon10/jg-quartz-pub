###### v1
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, that _was_ the first year of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,

###### v2
which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v3
"From _the_ thirteenth year of Josiah, the son of Amon, the king of Judah, even up to this day, these twenty-three years ^[Hebrew "year"] the word of Yahweh has come to me, and _I have spoken to you over and over again_, ^[Literally "I have spoken to you doing early and speaking"] but you have not listened.

###### v4
And _though_ Yahweh has sent all his servants the prophets to you _over and over again_ ^[Literally "do early and sending"] you have not listened, and you have not inclined your ear to hear,

###### v5
_saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Turn back please, each one from his evil way, and from the evil of your deeds, and live on the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] from a long time back and until forever,

###### v6
and you must not go after other gods to serve them, and to bow in worship to them, and you must not provoke me to anger with the work of your hands, then I will not do something bad to you.'

###### v7
'Yet you have not listened to me,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'so that you ^[Hebrew "they"] have provoked me to anger with the work of your hands for your own harm.'

###### v8
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh of hosts, 'Because you have not obeyed my words,

###### v9
look, I _am_ going to send and take all _the_ clans ^[Or "families"] of _the_ north,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'and _I will send_ ^[Here the subject and verb are supplied from context in the English translation] to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations all around, and I will destroy them, and I will make them a horror, and _an object of_ hissing, and _everlasting ruins_. ^[Literally "sites of ruins of eternity"]

###### v10
And I will exterminate from them the sound of jubilation, and the sound of joy, _the_ voice of _the_ bridegroom, and _the_ voice of _the_ bride, _the_ sound of _the_ millstones, and _the_ light of _the_ lamp.

###### v11
And all this land will become a site of ruins, a desolation, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years. ^[Hebrew "year"]

###### v12
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] when _the_ seventy years ^[Hebrew "year"] _are_ fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'for their iniquity, and _the_ land of _the_ Chaldeans, and I will make it _an everlasting waste_. ^[Literally "a waste of eternity"]

###### v13
And I will bring upon that land all my words that I have spoken against it, everything that is written in this scroll which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.

###### v14
For many nations and great kings will let them work, even them, and I will repay them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.'"

###### v15
For thus said Yahweh, the God of Israel, to me, "Take this cup of the wine _of_ wrath from my hand, and you must give it _to_ all the nations to whom I _am_ sending you to drink.

###### v16
And they will drink, and they will stagger, and they will act like madmen because of the _presence_ ^[Literally "face"] of the sword that I _am_ sending among them."

###### v17
So I took the cup from the hand of Yahweh and I gave _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] _to_ all the nations to whom Yahweh sent me to drink:

###### v18
Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, and its kings, _and_ its officials, to make them a site of ruins, a horror, an _object of_ hissing, and a curse, as _it is_ this day;

###### v19
Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and his servants, and his officials, and all his people;

###### v20
and all the other ^[Or "foreign"] people; and all the kings of the land of Uz; and all the kings of the land of _the_ Philistines-- ^[Hebrew "Philistine"]Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;

###### v21
Edom, and Moab, and the _Ammonites_; ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"]

###### v22
and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastland that _is_ across the sea;

###### v23
and Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all those who are trimmed to _the_ side;

###### v24
and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the other ^[Or "foreign"] people who dwell in the desert; ^[Or "wilderness"]

###### v25
and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;

###### v26
and all the kings of the north, near and far, each one to his brother, and all the kingdoms of the world that _are_ on the face of the earth; and the king of Sheshach, he will drink after them.

###### v27
"And you shall say to them, 'Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, "Drink and become drunk, and vomit, and fall, and you must not rise because of the _presence_ ^[Literally "face"] of the sword that I _am_ sending among you."'

###### v28
And it will happen, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, 'Thus says Yahweh of hosts, "You must certainly drink!

###### v29
For look, on the city that is called _by_ ^[Literally "on it"] my name I _am_ beginning to inflict harm, and you indeed, will you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I _am_ summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts.'

###### v30
And you yourself shall prophesy against them all these words, and you shall say to them:
'Yahweh will roar from _on_ high,
and from _his holy dwelling place_ ^[Literally "the dwelling place of his holiness"] he will give his voice.
He will roar mightily against his settlement,
a jubilant shout like those who tread _grapes_,
he will answer against all the inhabitants of the earth.

###### v31
_The_ rage of battle will resound to the end of the earth,
for _there is_ a lawsuit of Yahweh against the nations.
He _is_ entering into judgment with all wicked flesh,
he will give them to the sword,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh."

###### v32
Thus says Yahweh of hosts,
"Look, disaster _is_ going out from nation to nation,
and a great tempest is stirred up from the farthest parts of _the_ earth.

###### v33
And the slain _ones_ of Yahweh will be on that day
from _one_ end of the earth to the _other_ end of the earth,
and they will not be mourned,
and they will not be gathered,
and they will not be buried.
They will become like dung on the _surface_ ^[Literally "face"] of the ground.

###### v34
Wail, you shepherds, and cry out.
And roll about in mourning _in the dust_, O leaders ^[Or "nobles"] of the flock.
For your days of slaughter and your dispersions have arrived,
and you will fall like a vessel of desire.

###### v35
And flight will perish from the shepherds,
and escape from the leaders ^[Or "nobles"] of the flock.

###### v36
A sound, the cry of distress of the shepherds
and the wailing of the leaders ^[Or "nobles"] of the flock,
for Yahweh _is_ despoiling their pasture.

###### v37
And the _peaceful settlements_ ^[Literally "settlements of the peace"] are devastated
because of _the burning anger of Yahweh_. ^[Literally "the blaze of the nose of Yahweh"]

###### v38
He has left his den like a lion,
for their land has become a horror,
because of the anger of the oppressors,
and because of _his burning anger_." ^[Literally "the blaze of his nose"]
