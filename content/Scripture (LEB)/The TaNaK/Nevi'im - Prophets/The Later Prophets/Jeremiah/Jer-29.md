###### v1
And these _are_ the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remainder of the exiles, ^[Hebrew "exile"] and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had deported from Jerusalem _to_ Babylon,

###### v2
after the going out of Jeconiah the king, and the queen mother, and the court officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, and the artisans, ^[Hebrew "artisan"] and the smiths ^[Hebrew "smith"] from Jerusalem,

###### v3
by the hand of Elasah, the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah, the king of Judah, sent to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, _to_ Babylon, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v4
"Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles ^[Hebrew "exile"] whom I have deported from Jerusalem _to_ Babylon,

###### v5
'Build houses and live _in them_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and plant gardens and eat their fruit.

###### v6
Take wives and father sons and daughters, and take for your sons wives, and give your daughters to men that they may bear sons and daughters, and multiply there, and you must not be few.

###### v7
And seek the prosperity of the city where I have deported you, and pray on behalf of it to Yahweh, for in its prosperity you will have prosperity.'

###### v8
For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Do not let your prophets who _are_ in your midst, and your diviners, deceive you, and you must not listen to your dreams that you _are_ causing _them_ to dream.

###### v9
For they _are_ prophesying _falsely_ ^[Literally "in a lie"] to you in my name; I have not sent them,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v10
For thus says Yahweh, '_As soon as the time has passed_, ^[Literally "When to the mouth of being full"] seventy years ^[Hebrew "year"] for Babylon, I will attend to you, and I will fulfill my good word to you, to bring you back to this place.

###### v11
For I know the plans that I _am_ planning concerning you,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'plans for prosperity and not for harm, to give to you a future and a hope.

###### v12
Then _when_ you call me, and you come and pray to me, then I will listen to you.

###### v13
When you search for me, then you will find _me_, if you seek me with all your heart.

###### v14
And I will let myself be found by you,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'and I will restore your fortunes, ^[Hebrew "fortune"] and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places to which I have driven you,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'and I will bring you back to the place from which I deported you.'

###### v15
Because you have said, 'Yahweh has raised up prophets for us _in_ Babylon'--

###### v16
for thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne of David and concerning all the people who live in this city, your fellow kinsmen who did not go with you into the exile--

###### v17
thus says Yahweh of hosts, 'Look, I _am_ going to send among them the sword, the famine, and the plague, and I will make them like rotten figs that cannot be eaten because of _their_ bad quality.

###### v18
And I will pursue them with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague, and I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, and a horror, and _an object of_ hissing, and a disgrace among all the nations to which I have driven them,

###### v19
because they did not listen to my words,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'when I sent to them my servants the prophets, _sending over and over again_, ^[Literally "doing early and sending"] and they would not listen,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v20
And you, hear the word of Yahweh, all _you_ exiles ^[Hebrew "exile"] whom I sent away from Jerusalem _to_ Babylon.

###### v21
Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab, the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah, the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you in my name a lie, 'Look, I _am_ going to give them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and he will strike them before your eyes.

###### v22
And a curse will be taken _up_ because of them by all the exiles ^[Hebrew "exile"] of Judah who _are_ in Babylon, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "May Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,"

###### v23
because they have done a disgraceful thing in Israel, and they have committed adultery with the wives of their neighbors, and they have spoken words ^[Hebrew "word"] in my name, lies ^[Hebrew "lie"] that I have not commanded them, and I _am_ he who knows, and _I am_ a witness,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh."

###### v24
And to Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall say, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v25
"Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Because you yourself sent _a_ letter ^[Hebrew "letters"] in your name to all the people who _are_ in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v26
"Yahweh made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, so that there are overseers _in_ the house of Yahweh over any mad man _who_ exhibits the behavior of a prophet, and you must put him into the stocks and into the neck iron,

###### v27
and so then why have you not rebuked Jeremiah the Anathothite who exhibits the behavior of a prophet for you?

###### v28
_Because_ ^[Literally "Seeing that unto thus"] he has sent to us _in_ Babylon, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'It _will be_ a long time, build houses and live _in them_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and plant gardens and eat their fruit.'"'"

###### v29
And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the _hearing_ ^[Literally "ears"] of Jeremiah the prophet.

###### v30
And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v31
"Send to all the exiles, ^[Hebrew "exile"] _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: "Because Shemaiah prophesied to you, though I have not sent him, and he has made you trust in a lie,"

###### v32
_therefore_ ^[Literally "to thus"] thus says Yahweh, "Look, I _am_ going to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his offspring. There will not be for him a man who lives in the midst of this people, and he will not see the good that I _am_ going to do to my people," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "For he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh."'"
