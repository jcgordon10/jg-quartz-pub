The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Write for yourself all the words that I have spoken to you in a scroll.

###### v3
For look, days _are_ coming,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'when I will restore the fortunes ^[Hebrew "fortune"] of my people Israel and Judah,' says Yahweh, 'and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] and they will take possession of it.'"

###### v4
Now these _are_ the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.

###### v5
"For thus says Yahweh:
'We have heard a sound of trembling,
terror, and there is no peace.

###### v6
Ask please and see whether a male can bear a child.
Why _do_ I see every strong man
_with_ his hands on his loins like a woman giving birth?
And _why_ are all _their_ faces changed to paleness?

###### v7
Alas! For that day _is_ great,
_there is none like it_. ^[Literally "from none like it"]
And it _is_ a time of distress for Jacob,
yet from it he will be delivered.

###### v8
And it will happen on that day,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts,
'I will break his yoke from your neck
and your bonds I will tear to pieces.
And strangers will no longer let him work as a slave.

###### v9
But they will serve Yahweh their God,
and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.

###### v10
But you must not fear, my servant Jacob,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
'and you must not be dismayed, Israel,
for look, I _am_ going to save you from far,
and your offspring from the land of their captivity.
And Jacob will return,
and he will be at rest,
and he will be at ease,
and there will be no _one who_ makes _him_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] afraid.

###### v11
For I am with you,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'to save you.
For I will make a complete destruction
of all the nations to which I scattered you,
but you I will not make a complete destruction.
And I will chastise you to the measure,
and I will not leave you entirely unpunished.'

###### v12
For thus says Yahweh,
'Your injury _is_ incurable,
your wound _is_ overcome by sickness.

###### v13
There is no _one who_ pleads your cause,
for _your_ boil there is no healing for you.

###### v14
All your lovers have forgotten you,
they do not care for you.
I have struck you _with the_ blow of an enemy,
_the_ punishment of _the_ cruel,
because of the greatness of your guilt,
your sins are numerous.

###### v15
Why do you cry because of your wound?
Your pain _is_ incurable.
Because of the greatness of your guilt--your sins are vast--
I have done these _things_ to you.

###### v16
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] all _those who_ devour you will be devoured,
and all your foes, all of them will go into captivity,
and _those who_ plunder you will be as plunder,
and all _those who_ plunder you I will make as plunder.

###### v17
For I will present healing to you,
and I will heal you of your wounds,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.
'Because they have called you an outcast, _saying_,
"It is Zion, there is no _one who_ cares for her."'

###### v18
Thus says Yahweh:
'Look, I _will_ restore the fortunes ^[Hebrew "fortune"] of the tents of Jacob,
and I will have compassion on his dwellings,
and _the_ city will be rebuilt upon its mound,
and _the_ citadel fortress will stand on its rightful site.

###### v19
And thanksgiving and _the_ sound of merrymakers
will come out from them,
and I will make them numerous,
and they will not be few.
And I will make them honored,
and they will not be lowly.

###### v20
And their children will be as of old,
and their community will be established _before me_. ^[Literally "to the face of me"]
And I will punish all their oppressors.

###### v21
    And their noble will be from them,
and their ruler will come out from their midst.
And I will bring him near and he will approach me.
For who _is_ he that would pledge his heart to approach me?' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v22
'And you will be to me a people,
and I will be to you God.'"

###### v23
Look, the storm of Yahweh!
Wrath has gone forth,
a whirling tempest.
It will whirl upon _the_ head of _the_ wicked.

###### v24
_The burning anger of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "The blaze of the nose of Yahweh"] will not turn back until his doing,
and until his accomplishing the plans of his _mind_. ^[Literally "heart"]
In the last of the days you will understand it.
