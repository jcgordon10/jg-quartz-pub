###### v1
"At that time," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"I will be the God of all the clans ^[Or "families"] of Israel,
and they will be to me a people."

###### v2
Thus says Yahweh:
"_The_ people of _the_ survivors of the sword found grace in the desert; ^[Or "wilderness"]
Israel going to find their rest."

###### v3
From afar Yahweh appeared to me, _saying_,
"I have loved you _with_ an everlasting love.
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "Unto thus"] I have drawn you _with_ loyal love.

###### v4
I will again build you,
and you will be built, O virgin Israel.
You will again adorn yourself _with_ your tambourines,
and you will go forth in _the_ dancing in a ring of _the_ merrymakers.

###### v5
You will again plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria.
_The_ planters will plant, and they will enjoy _it_. ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v6
For there will be a day _when_ watchmen will call in the hill country of Ephraim,
'Stand up, and let us go up _to_ Zion, to Yahweh our God.'"

###### v7
For thus says Yahweh,
"Sing for joy for Jacob _with_ gladness,
and shout out for the head of the nations.
Proclaim, praise, and say,
'Save, _O_ Yahweh, your people, the remnant of Israel.'

###### v8
Look, I _am_ going to bring them from _the_ land of _the_ north,
and I will gather them from _the_ remotest part of _the_ earth.
Among them _the_ blind, and _the_ lame,
_those who are_ pregnant, and _those who_ give birth,
together, a great assembly,
they will return here.

###### v9
With weeping they will come,
and with pleas for mercy I will bring them;
I will let them walk by streams of water in a straight path.
They will not stumble in it,
for I have become to Israel a father,
and Ephraim, he _is_ my firstborn."

###### v10
Hear the word of Yahweh, _O_ nations,
and declare in the coastlands from afar, and say,
"The scatterer of Israel will gather him,
and he will keep him as a shepherd his flock.

###### v11
For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob,
and he has redeemed him from _the_ hand of _the_ person _stronger_ ^[Literally "strong"] than he.

###### v12
And they will come,
and they will sing for joy on the height of Zion,
and they will be radiant over the goodness of Yahweh,
over _the_ grain, and over _the_ wine, and over _the_ olive oil,
and over _the_ young ones of _the_ flock, and over _the_ cattle.
And their life will become like a well-watered garden,
and they will never languish again."

###### v13
"Then _the_ young woman will rejoice in _the_ dancing in a ring,
and _the_ young men and _the_ old men together.
And I will turn their mourning to jubilation,
and I will comfort them,
and I will gladden them from their sorrow.

###### v14
And I will saturate the appetite of the priests _with_ fatness,
and my people will be satisfied with my goodness," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v15
Thus says Yahweh,
"A voice _is_ heard in Ramah,
lamentation, _the_ weeping of bitterness.
Rachel _is_ weeping for her children;
she refuses to be comforted because of her children,
for they are no _more_."

###### v16
Thus says Yahweh:
"Restrain your voice from weeping,
and your eyes from tears,
for there is a reward for your work," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and they will return from _the_ land of _the_ enemy.

###### v17
And there is hope for your future," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and _your_ children will return to their territory.

###### v18
Indeed I heard Ephraim pitying themselves,
'You disciplined me, and I was disciplined,
like a calf that is not trained.
Bring me back and let me return,
for you _are_ Yahweh my God.

###### v19
For after my turning back I repented,
and after coming to understand I struck _my_ thigh.
I was ashamed and also humiliated,
because I bore the disgrace of my youth.'

###### v20
_Is_ Ephraim my dear son,
or _the_ child of _my_ delight?
For _as often as_ ^[Literally "from enough"] I have earnestly spoken against him,
I still remember him.
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "Unto thus"] my bowels are turbulent for him,
surely I will have compassion on him," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v21
"Set up for yourself road markers,
make for yourself signposts,
set your _mind_ ^[Literally "heart"] to the main road,
_the_ road _by which_ you went.
Return, O virgin of Israel,
return to these your cities.

###### v22
_How long_ ^[Literally "Until when"] will you waver, O unfaithful daughter?
For Yahweh has created a new _thing_ on the earth,
a woman, she shelters a man."

###### v23
Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, "They will again say these words ^[Hebrew "word"] in the land of Judah and in its towns at my restoring their fortunes, ^[Hebrew "fortune"]
'Yahweh bless you, _O_ settlement of righteousness,
O hill of holiness.'

###### v24
And Judah and all of its towns together will live in it,
farmers and those who travel with the flocks. ^[Hebrew "flock"]

###### v25
For I will saturate _the_ thirst of _the_ weary,
and every person _who_ languishes I will replenish."

###### v26
At this I awoke and looked,
and my sleep was pleasant to me.

###### v27
"Look, _the_ days _are_ coming," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "and I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah _with the_ seed of humankind, and _with the_ seed of animals. ^[Hebrew "animal"]

###### v28
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] as I have watched over them to pull up, and to tear down, and to annihilate, and to destroy, and to do evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v29
"In those days they will say no longer, '_Parents_ ^[Literally "Fathers"] have eaten unripe fruit, and _the_ teeth of _the_ children _are set on edge_ ^[Literally "have become blunt"].'

###### v30
_But_ ^[Literally "But if"] each will die because of his iniquity, _everyone_ ^[Literally "all of the humankind"] who eats the unripe fruit, their teeth will _be set on edge_. ^[Literally "become blunt"]

###### v31
Look, _the_ days _are_ coming," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "and I will _make_ ^[Literally "cut"] a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,

###### v32
not like the covenant that I _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] with their ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] on the day of my grasping _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] by their hand, bringing them out from the land of Egypt, my covenant that they themselves broke, though I myself was a master over them," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v33
"But this _is_ the covenant that I will _make_ ^[Literally "cut"] with the house of Israel after those days," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh: "I will put my law in their inward parts and on their hearts ^[Hebrew "heart"] I will write it, and I will be to them God, and they themselves will be to me people.

###### v34
And they will no longer teach each one his neighbor, or each one his brother, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Know Yahweh,' for all of them will know me, from their _smallest_ ^[Literally "small"] and up to their _greatest_," ^[Literally "great"] _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "for I will forgive their iniquity and their sin I will no longer remember."

###### v35
Thus says Yahweh, who gives _the_ sun for light by day, the regulations of _the_ moon and _the_ stars for light _by_ night, who stirs up the sea and its waves roar--Yahweh of hosts _is_ his name.

###### v36
"If these rules would cease from _before me_," ^[Literally "to the face of me"] _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "also the offspring of Israel would cease from being a nation _before me_ ^[Literally "to the face of me"] _forever_." ^[Literally "all the days"]

###### v37
Thus says Yahweh, "If _the_ heavens above can be measured, and _the_ foundations of _the_ earth below can be explored, also I will reject all the offspring of Israel because of all that they have done," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v38
"Look, days _are_ coming," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, "and the city will be rebuilt for Yahweh, from the Tower of Hananel _to_ the Corner Gate.

###### v39
And _the measuring line_ ^[Literally "the string of the measurement"] will still go out immediately in front _of_ it to the hill of Gareb, and it will turn _to_ Goah.

###### v40
And the whole of the valley _of_ the corpses, and the ashes, and all the cultivated fields up to the wadi of Kidron, up to the corner of the Gate of the Horses _toward the_ east _will be_ holy to Yahweh. It will not be uprooted, and it will not be overthrown again _forever_." ^[Literally "to eternity"]
