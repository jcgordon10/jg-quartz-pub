###### v1
The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah the king of Judah, that _was_ the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.

###### v2
Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon _was_ laying siege to Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard that _was in_ the palace of the king of Judah,

###### v3
where Zedekiah, the king of Judah, had confined him, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "Why _are_ you prophesying, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Thus says Yahweh, "Look, I _am_ going to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it,

###### v4
and Zedekiah, the king of Judah, will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but surely he will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and _he will speak face to face with him_ ^[Literally "his mouth shall speak with his mouth"] and _he will see him eye to eye_, ^[Literally "his eyes shall see his eyes"]

###### v5
and _to_ Babylon he will bring Zedekiah, and there he will be until my attending to him," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh. "If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not be successful"'?"

###### v6
And Jeremiah said, "The word of Yahweh came to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v7
'Look, Hanamel, the son of Shallum, your uncle, _is_ going to come to you, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "Buy for yourself my field that _is_ at Anathoth, for _you have_ ^[Literally "to you is"] the right of redemption to buy _it_."' ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v8
Then Hanamel, the son of my uncle, came to me, to the courtyard of the guard _according to_ ^[Literally "as"] the word of Yahweh, and he said to me, 'Please buy my field that _is_ at Anathoth, that _is_ in the land of Benjamin, for to you _is_ the claim of possession, and to you the redemption; buy _it_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] for yourself.' Then I knew that this _was_ the word of Yahweh.

###### v9
And I bought the field from Hanamel, the son of my uncle, that _was_ at Anathoth. And I weighed out to him the money, seventeen silver shekels.

###### v10
And I signed on the letter ^[Or "scroll"] and sealed _it_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and I called witnesses as witness, and I weighed out the money on a set of scales.

###### v11
Then I took the deed ^[Or "scroll"] of the purchase, the sealed _copy containing_ the commandments ^[Hebrew "commandment"] and the rules, together with the _one_ that was open.

###### v12
And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, _in the presence of_ ^[Literally "before the eyes of"] Hanamel, _the son of_ my uncle, and _in the presence of_ ^[Literally "before the eyes of"] the witnesses who signed the deed of the purchase, _in the presence of_ ^[Literally "before the eyes of"] the Judeans ^[Hebrew "Judean"] who were sitting in the courtyard of the guard.

###### v13
And I commanded Baruch _in their presence_, ^[Literally "before their eyes"] _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v14
'Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, "Take these deeds, ^[Or "scrolls"] this deed of the purchase, the sealed one, and this opened deed, and you must put them in an _earthenware jar_ ^[Literally "jar of earthenware"] so that they may be kept preserved many days."

###### v15
For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: "Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land."'

###### v16
And I prayed to Yahweh--after giving my deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah--_saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v17
'Ah Lord Yahweh! Look, you made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. _Nothing_ ^[Literally "Not all a thing"] is too difficult for you,

###### v18
showing loyal love to the thousands, and repaying the guilt of _parents_ ^[Literally "fathers"] into the laps ^[Hebrew "lap"] of their children after them. Powerful, great, mighty, his name _is_ Yahweh of hosts,

###### v19
great in counsel and great _in_ deed, whose eyes _are_ opened to all the ways of the children of humankind, to give to each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds,

###### v20
who accomplished signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, up to this day, and in Israel, and among humankind, and you have made for yourself a name, as _it is_ this day.

###### v21
And you brought out your people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an arm stretched out, and with great terror.

###### v22
And you gave to them this land, which you swore to their ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] to give to them, a land flowing with milk and honey.

###### v23
And they entered and took possession of it, but they did not listen to your voice, and they did not follow your law. They did nothing of all that you commanded to them to do, and you caused to happen _to_ them all this disaster.

###### v24
Look, the siege ramps have come up _to_ the city to capture it, and the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the plague, and what you spoke happened, and look, you _are_ seeing _it_. ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v25
Yet you have said to me, Lord Yahweh, "Buy for yourself the field with the money, and call witnesses as witness," though the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.'"

###### v26
And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v27
"Look, I _am_ Yahweh, _the_ God of all flesh; is _anything_ ^[Literally "all thing"] too difficult for me?"

###### v28
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh: "Look, I _am_ going to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.

###### v29
And the Chaldeans, who are fighting against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and they will burn it, and the houses where they have made smoke offerings on their roofs to Baal, and _where_ they have devoted libations to other gods, in order to provoke me to anger.

###### v30
For the people ^[Or "sons/children"] of Israel and the people ^[Or "sons/children"] of Judah were doing only evil in my eyes from their youth, for the people ^[Or "sons/children"] of Israel _were_ only provoking me to anger by the work of their hands," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v31
"For this city has been for me _a cause_ of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even until this day, _so I will_ remove it from my _sight_, ^[Literally "face"]

###### v32
because of all the evil of the people ^[Or "sons/children"] of Israel and the people ^[Or "sons/children"] of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger--they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets, and the men ^[Hebrew "man"] of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

###### v33
And they have turned to me _their_ backs ^[Hebrew "back"] and not _their_ faces, though _I have taught them over and over again_, ^[Literally "I have taught them doing early and teaching"] but they _were_ not listening to accept discipline.

###### v34
And they set up their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it.

###### v35
And they built the high places of Baal that _are_ in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to present as offerings their sons and their daughters to Molech, which I had not commanded them, and it had not come to my _mind_ ^[Literally "heart"] to do this detestable thing in order to cause Judah to sin."

###### v36
"So now _therefore_, ^[Literally "to thus"] thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning this city, _of_ which you _are_ saying, 'It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague':

###### v37
Look, I _am_ going to gather them from all the lands _to_ which I driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath, and I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell _in safety_. ^[Literally "with confidence"]

###### v38
And they will be for me a people, and I will be for them God.

###### v39
And I will give to them one heart and one way, to revere me _forever_, ^[Literally "all the days"] for good to them, and to their children after them.

###### v40
And I will _make_ ^[Literally "cut"] with them _an everlasting covenant_ ^[Literally "a covenant of eternity"] that I will not turn away from them, my doing good _to_ them, and my reverence I will put in their hearts ^[Hebrew "heart"] so that _they will_ not turn aside from me.

###### v41
And I will rejoice over them to do good _to_ them, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness with all my heart, and with all my inner self." ^[Or "soul"]

###### v42
"For thus says Yahweh, 'Just as I have brought to this people all this great disaster, so I _will_ bring upon them all the good that I promise to them.

###### v43
And the fields ^[Hebrew "field"] will be bought in this land _of_ which you _are_ saying, "It _is_ a desolation, _without humankind or animals_. ^[Literally "from there is not humankind and animal"] It has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans."

###### v44
They will buy fields with money, and they will sign the deeds, ^[Hebrew "scroll"] and they will seal _them_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and they will call witnesses as witness in the land of Benjamin, and in the surroundings of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negev, for I will restore their fortunes,' ^[Hebrew "fortune"] _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh."
