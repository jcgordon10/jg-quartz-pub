###### v1
And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah _a_ second _time_ while he _was_ still held back in the courtyard of the guard, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Thus says Yahweh who made _the earth_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] Yahweh who formed it to establish it, Yahweh _is_ his name:

###### v3
'Call to me, and I will answer you, and I will tell you great _things_ and inaccessible _things that_ you have not known.'

###### v4
For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, that were torn down _to make a defense_ against the siege ramps and against the sword:

###### v5
'_They are_ coming to fight against the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the corpses of the people whom I will strike in my anger and in my wrath, for whom I have hidden my face from this city because of all their wickedness.

###### v6
Look, I _am_ going to bring healing and health to it, and I will heal them, and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and reliability.

###### v7
And I will restore the fortunes ^[Hebrew "fortune"] of Judah and the fortunes ^[Hebrew "fortune"] of Israel, and I will rebuild them as in the beginning.

###### v8
And I will cleanse them from all their guilt that they sinned against me, and I will forgive all their iniquities that they sinned against me, and that they rebelled against me.

###### v9
And it will be to me a name of jubilation, a praise, and a glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear all the good that I _will_ do _for_ them, and they will fear, ^[Or "tremble"] and they will tremble because of all the good, and because of all the prosperity that I _will_ provide for it.'

###### v10
"Thus says Yahweh: 'Again will be heard in this place, _of_ which you _are_ saying, "It _is_ a waste, _without_ ^[Literally "from there is not"] people and _without_ ^[Literally "from there is not"] animals," ^[Hebrew "animal"] in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, _without_ ^[Literally "from there is not"] people and _without_ ^[Literally "from there is not"] inhabitants ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"] and _without_ ^[Literally "from there is not"] animals, ^[Hebrew "animal"]

###### v11
_the_ voice of jubilation, and _the_ voice of joy, _the_ voice of _the_ bridegroom, and _the_ voice of _the_ bride, _the_ voices ^[Hebrew "voice"] of _those who_ say, "Praise Yahweh of hosts, for Yahweh _is_ good, for his loyal love _is_ _forever_," ^[Literally "to eternity"] _the voices of those who_ bring thank offerings ^[Hebrew "thank offering"] _to_ the house of Yahweh, for I will restore the fortunes ^[Hebrew "fortune"] of the land as in the beginning,' says Yahweh.

###### v12
Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 'Again there will be in this waste place, _without_ ^[Literally "from there is not"] people and animals, ^[Hebrew "animal"] and in all its towns, pasture for shepherds allowing _their_ flock to lie down.

###### v13
In the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the Shephelah, and in the towns of the Negev, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the surroundings _of_ Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under _the_ hands of _the_ counter,' says Yahweh.

###### v14
'Look, days _are_ coming,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'and I will fulfill the good promise ^[Or "word"] that I promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.

###### v15
In those days and in that time I will make a branch of righteousness sprout for David, and he will execute justice and righteousness in the land.

###### v16
In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell _safely_, ^[Literally "with confidence"] and this _is_ what they shall call it: "Yahweh _is_ our righteousness."'

###### v17
For thus says Yahweh: 'A man who sits on the throne of the house of Israel will not be cut off for David.

###### v18
And for the priests, a man from the Levites _who_ offers burnt offerings ^[Hebrew "burnt offering"] and _who_ burns grain offerings ^[Hebrew "grain offering"] and _who_ brings sacrifices ^[Hebrew "sacrifice"] will not be cut off _before me_ ^[Literally "to the face of me"] _forever_.'" ^[Literally "all the days"]

###### v19
And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v20
"Thus says Yahweh: 'If you could break my covenant _with_ the day, and my covenant _with_ the night, so that day and night _would_ not come at their time,

###### v21
then my covenant could be broken with David my servant, from _having_ ^[Literally "being for him"] a son who could rule on his throne, and with the Levites, the priests, my ministers.

###### v22
As the host of heaven cannot be counted, and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will make numerous the offspring of David my servant and the Levites _who_ minister _to_ me.'"

###### v23
And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v24
"Have you not seen how these people speak, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'The two clans ^[Or "families"] whom Yahweh chose, he has also rejected them'? Thus they spurn my people from being a nation _before them_ ^[Literally "to the face of them"] _any_ longer.

###### v25
Thus says Yahweh: 'If my covenant _with_ day and _with_ night, _the_ regulations of heaven and earth, I had not established,

###### v26
then the offspring of Jacob and David my servant I would reject, from choosing rulers from his offspring over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will restore their fortunes ^[Hebrew "fortune"] and I will have compassion on them.'"
