###### v1
The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and all his army, with all _the_ kingdoms of _the_ earth _under_ the dominion of his hand, and all the peoples _were_ fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: 'Go and say to Zedekiah the king of Judah, now you must say to him, "Thus says Yahweh: 'Look, I _am_ going to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.

###### v3
And you will not escape from his hand, but surely you will be captured, and into his hand you will be given, and _you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye_, ^[Literally "your eyes shall see with the eyes of the king of Babylon"] and _you will speak face to face with him_, ^[Literally "his mouth shall speak with your mouth"] and _to_ Babylon you will go.'

###### v4
However, hear the word of Yahweh, _O_ Zedekiah, the king of Judah. Thus says Yahweh concerning you: 'You will not die by the sword.

###### v5
In peace you will die, and as _there was_ burning for your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] the former kings who were _before you_, ^[Literally "to the face of you"] so they will burn for you, and they will lament for you, "Alas, lord!" For _the_ word I have spoken,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh."'"

###### v6
Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Zedekiah the king of Judah all these words in Jerusalem

###### v7
when the army of the king of Babylon _was_ fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left over--Lachish and Azekah, for these remained among the cities of Judah, the cities of fortification.

###### v8
The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after king Zedekiah _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] a covenant with all the people who _were_ in Jerusalem to proclaim release to them,

###### v9
to let go each one his _male_ slave and each one his female slave, the Hebrew and the free Hebrew, _so that_ no one among the Judeans ^[Hebrew "Judean"] _should_ enslave his fellow countryman.

###### v10
And all the officials and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant to let go each one his _male_ slave and each one his female slave, not enslaving them again, and they obeyed and they let _them_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] go.

###### v11
But _afterward_ ^[Literally "after thus"] they turned back and they brought back the _male_ slaves and the female slaves whom they had let go free, and they subdued them as _male_ slaves and female slaves.

###### v12
And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v13
"Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: 'I _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] a covenant with your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] on the day of my bringing them out from the land of Egypt, from _the_ house of slaves, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v14
"At _the_ end of seven years you must let go each one his fellow countryman, the Hebrew who has been sold to you and who has served you six years, and you must let him go free from you." But your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] did not listen to me, and they did not incline their ears. ^[Hebrew "ear"]

###### v15
And you turned back _recently_ ^[Literally "the day"] and you did right in my eyes, to proclaim release each one to his neighbor, and you _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] a covenant _before me_ ^[Literally "to the face of me"] in the house that is called _by_ ^[Literally "on it"] my name.

###### v16
But you turned back and you profaned my name when you brought back each one his _male_ slave and each one his female slave, whom you had let go free according to their desire, and you subdued them to be to you as _male_ slaves and as female slaves.'

###### v17
"_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh, 'You have not listened to me to proclaim release each one to his fellow countryman and each one to his neighbor. Look, I _am_ going to proclaim to you a release,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'to the sword, to the plague, and to the famine, and I will make you a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth.

###### v18
And I will make the men who transgressed my covenant, who have not kept the words of the covenant that they _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] _before me_, ^[Literally "to the face of me"] _like_ the calf which they cut in two and they passed between its parts--

###### v19
the officials of Judah, and the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf--

###### v20
and I will give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of the seekers of their lives, and their dead bodies ^[Hebrew "dead body"] will become as food for the birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of the heavens ^[Or "sky"] and for the animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] of the earth.

###### v21
And Zedekiah the king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of the seekers of their lives, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, who retreated from you.

###### v22
Look, I _am_ going to command,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'and I will bring them back to this city, and they will fight against it, and they will capture it, and they will burn it with fire, and the towns of Judah I will make a desolation _without_ ^[Literally "from there is not"] an inhabitant.'"
