###### v1
Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah _was_ saying to all the people, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Thus says Yahweh, 'The _one who_ stays in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague. But the _one who_ goes out to the Chaldeans will live. And his life will be for him as booty, and he will live.'

###### v3
Thus says Yahweh, 'Surely this city will be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.'"

###### v4
Then the officials said to the king, "Please, this man must be killed, _because_ ^[Literally "unto thus"] he _is_ making slack the hands of _the soldiers_ ^[Literally "the men of the war"] who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking to them words like these, for this man _is_ not seeking for welfare ^[Or "peace"] to this people, _but only_ ^[Literally "but if"] for harm."

###### v5
And Zedekiah the king said, "Look, he _is_ in your hand, for the king is not able _to do_ a thing against you."

###### v6
So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the pit ^[Or "cistern"] _of_ Malchiah, the son of the king, which _was_ in the courtyard of the guard. And they let Jeremiah down by ropes. Now in the pit ^[Or "cistern"] there was no water, ^[Hebrew "waters"] _but only_ ^[Literally "but if"] mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.

###### v7
When Ebed-melech the Cushite, _a eunuch_ ^[Literally "a man of a eunuch"] who _was_ in the house of the king, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the pit ^[Or "cistern"]--now the king _was_ sitting at the Gate of Benjamin--

###### v8
Ebed-melech went out from the house of the king and spoke to the king, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v9
"My lord the king, these men have done evil _in_ all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, _in_ that they have thrown _him_ into the pit, ^[Or "cistern"] and he will die _there_ ^[Literally "in it"] _because of_ ^[Literally "from the face of"] starvation, for there is no longer any bread in the city."

###### v10
Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "Take _with you_ ^[Literally "in your hand"] these thirty men and pull Jeremiah the prophet up from the pit ^[Or "cistern"] _before_ ^[Literally "at not yet"] he dies."

###### v11
So Ebed-melech took the men _with him_ ^[Literally "in his hand"] and went _to_ the palace of the king, to _a place_ beneath the storehouse, and he took from there _rags_ ^[Literally "the rags of rags"] and _worn-out clothes_. ^[Literally "rags of ragged clothes"] And he let them down into the pit ^[Or "cistern"] by ropes to Jeremiah.

###### v12
Then Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, "Please put _the rags_ ^[Literally "rags of the rags"] and _worn-out clothes_ ^[Literally "ragged clothes"] under the joints of your arms under the ropes," and Jeremiah did so.

###### v13
And they pulled Jeremiah by the ropes and brought him up from the pit. ^[Or "cistern"] And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard.

###### v14
And Zedekiah the king sent and made someone bring Jeremiah the prophet to him, to _the_ third entrance that _was_ at the _temple_ ^[Literally "house"] of Yahweh. And the king said to Jeremiah, "I _am_ asking you _something_, ^[Literally "a thing"] you must not hide _anything_ ^[Literally "a thing"] from me."

###### v15
And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, will you not surely kill me? _Besides_, ^[Literally "And"] if I advise you, you will not listen to me.

###### v16
So Zedekiah the king swore to Jeremiah in secret, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "_As Yahweh lives_, ^[Literally "Life of Yahweh"] who has made for us this life, I will not kill you and I will not give you into the hand of these men who are seeking your life."

###### v17
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, 'If only you will go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then _you_ ^[Literally "your life" or "your soul"] will live, and this city will not be burned with fire, and you will live, you and your house.

###### v18
But if you _do_ not go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape from their hand.'"

###### v19
And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, "I _am_ afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they give me into their hand and they abuse me."

###### v20
And Jeremiah said, "They will not give _you over_. Please obey the voice of Yahweh with regard to what I _am_ saying to you, and it will go well with you, and _you_ ^[Literally "your life" or "your soul"] will live.

###### v21
But if you _are_ refusing to surrender, this _is_ the thing that Yahweh has shown me.

###### v22
Now look, all the women who remain in the house of the king of Judah _are_ being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon. And look, _they are_ saying,
'_Your trusted friends_ ^[Literally "The men of your peace"] have misled you,
and they have prevailed against you.
Your feet are stuck in the mud,
_so_ they turned backward.'

###### v23
And all your wives and your children _will be_ led out to the Chaldeans, and you will not escape from their hand, but by the hand of the king of Babylon you will be seized, and this city will burn with fire."

###### v24
And Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "No man must know about these words so that you will not die.

###### v25
And if the officials hear that I have spoken with you, and they come to you and say to you, 'Please tell us what you said to the king. You must not conceal _it_ from us so that we will not kill you. And what did the king say to you?'

###### v26
Then you shall say to them, 'I _was_ presenting my plea _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the king, to not cause me to return _to_ the house of Jonathan to die there.'"

###### v27
And all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, and he informed them like all these words that the king commanded. So they fell silent, for the _conversation_ ^[Literally "word"] was not heard.

###### v28
And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard until _the_ day that Jerusalem was captured. And it happened that Jerusalem was captured. ^[[[Jer-38#v28|Jeremiah 38:28b]] in the Hebrew Bible is 39:1a in the English Bible]
