###### v1
The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after Nebuzaradan, _the_ captain of _the_ guard, ^[Hebrew "guards"] had let him go from Ramah, _where he had been taken_ ^[Literally "at his taking him] bound in chains in the midst of all the exiles ^[Hebrew "exile"] of Jerusalem and Judah who were being deported _to_ Babylon.

###### v2
And _the_ captain of _the_ guard ^[Hebrew "guards"] took Jeremiah and said to him, "Yahweh your God threatened this disaster to this place,

###### v3
and _now_ he has brought _it about_, ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and Yahweh has done _just as_ ^[Literally "as that"] he threatened. Because you sinned against Yahweh and did not listen to his voice, so this thing _has_ happened to you.

###### v4
And so then look, I have released you _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] from the chains that _were_ on your hands. ^[Hebrew "hand"] If it is good in your eyes to come with me _to_ Babylon, _then_ come, and _I will take care of you_. ^[Literally "I will place my eye on you"] But if it is bad in your eyes to come with me _to_ Babylon, _then_ refrain. Look, the whole land _is_ _before you_. ^[Literally "to the face of you"] To _wherever it is_ good and right in your eyes to go, _then_ go there."

###### v5
While he still had not turned back, _Nebuzaradan_ added, "Return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed _in an official position_ over the towns of Judah, and stay with him in the midst of the people. Or to _wherever it is_ right in your eyes to go, _then_ go _there_." ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] Then _the_ captain of _the_ guard ^[Hebrew "guards"] gave him an allowance of provisions and a present, and let him go.

###### v6
So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, _at_ Mizpah and stayed with him in the midst of the people who were left in the land.

###### v7
When all the commanders of the armies who _were_ in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam _in an official position_ in the land, and that _he had put him in charge of_ ^[Literally "he had appointed to him"] men, and women, and little children, and of the poor of the land, of _all those_ who had not been deported _to_ Babylon,

###### v8
then they went to Gedaliah _at_ Mizpah--Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan, and Jehonathan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.

###### v9
And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "You must not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.

###### v10
_As for me_, ^[Literally "And I"] look, I _am_ staying at Mizpah to represent _you_ _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the Chaldeans who come to us. But you, gather wine and summer fruit and oil, and put _them_ in your vessels, and live in your towns that you have seized."

###### v11
And also all the Judeans who _were_ in Moab, and among the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] and in Edom, and who _were_ in all the lands, _when_ they heard that the king of Babylon had given a remnant to Judah and that he had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, _in an official position_ over them,

###### v12
then all the Judeans returned from all the places _to_ which they were scattered. And they came _to_ the land of Judah, to Gedaliah _at_ Mizpah, and they gathered wine and summer fruit that yielded _in great abundance_. ^[Literally "very numerous"]

###### v13
And Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who _were_ in the open country came to Gedaliah _at_ Mizpah

###### v14
and said to him, "_Are you at all aware_ ^[Literally "know you know"] that Baalis, the king of the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, to kill you?" But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them.

###### v15
Then Johanan the son of Kareah said to Gedaliah in secrecy at Mizpah, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "Please let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and _nobody_ ^[Literally "not a man"] will know. Why should he kill you, so that all of Judah who are gathered to you will be scattered, and the remnant of Judah will perish?"

###### v16
But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, "You must not do this thing, for you _are_ telling a lie about Ishmael."
