_And then_ ^[Literally "And it was"] in the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, from the offspring of the kingship, and _one of_ the chief officers of the king, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam _at_ Mizpah, _along with_ ^[Literally "and"] ten men.

###### v6
And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out to meet them from Mizpah, _weeping as he came_. ^[Literally "coming he came and weeping"] _And then_ ^[Literally "And it was"] as _he was_ meeting them, he said to them, "Come to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam."

_And then_, ^[Literally "And it was"] the moment of their coming to the middle of the city, then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, _along with_ ^[Literally "and"] the men who _were_ with him, slaughtered ^[The Hebrew verb is singular] them _and threw them_ to the middle of the pit. ^[Or "cistern"]

###### v8
But ten men were found among them, and they said to Ishmael, "You must not kill us, for _we have_ ^[Literally "there is to us"] hidden treasures in the field, wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey. So he refrained and he did not kill them in the midst of their fellow countrymen.

###### v9
Now the pit ^[Or "cistern"] _into_ which Ishmael threw all the corpses of the men whom he had killed _along with_ ^[Literally "by the hand of"] Gedaliah _was the same one_ that King Asa had made because of Baasha the king of Israel, _who was_ against him.

###### v10
Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who _were_ in Mizpah, the daughters of the king and all the people who were left at Mizpah, _over_ whom Nebuzaradan, _the_ captain of _the_ guard, ^[Hebrew "guards"] had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. And Ishmael took them captive and set out to cross over to the _Ammonites_. ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"]

###### v11
When Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who _were_ with him, heard ^[The Hebrew verb is singular] all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,

###### v13
_And then_, ^[Literally "And it was"] the moment that all the people who _were_ with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who _were_ with him, they were glad.
