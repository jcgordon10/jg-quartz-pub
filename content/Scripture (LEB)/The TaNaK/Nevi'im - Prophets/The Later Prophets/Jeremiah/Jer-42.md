###### v1
Then all the commanders of the armies, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from _the_ smallest to _the_ greatest, approached

###### v2
and said to Jeremiah the prophet, "May our plea please fall _before you_, ^[Literally "to the face of you"] and pray for us to Yahweh your God, for all this remnant, for we are left _but_ a few of many, as your eyes _are_ seeing us.

###### v3
And let Yahweh your God inform us the way in which we should go and the thing that we should do."

###### v4
And Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard. Look, I _am_ going to pray to Yahweh your God according to your words, _and then_ ^[Literally "and it will happen"] all the words ^[Hebrew "word"] that Yahweh answers you I will tell you; I will not withhold from you a word."

###### v5
Then they said to Jeremiah, "May Yahweh be against us as _a true and faithful witness_ ^[Literally "a witness of faithfulness and trustworthy"] if we do not do according to all the words ^[Hebrew "word"] that Yahweh sends you for us.

###### v6
Whether good or bad, we will listen to the voice of Yahweh our God, _to_ whom we _are_ sending you, so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of Yahweh our God."

###### v7
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it was"] at _the_ end of ten days the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah.

###### v8
And he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the armies who _were_ with him, and all the people from _the_ smallest to _the_ greatest,

###### v9
and said to them, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to cause your plea to fall _before him_: ^[Literally "to the face of him"]

###### v10
'If only you will stay in this land, then I will build you and I will not tear _you_ down, and I will plant you and I will not pluck _you_ up, for I relent of the disaster that I have brought to you.

###### v11
You must not be afraid _of_ ^[Literally "from the face of"] the king of Babylon whom you _are_ _afraid of_. ^[Literally "in fear from the presence of him"] You must not be afraid of him,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'for I _am_ with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand.

###### v12
And I will show you compassion, and he will have compassion on you and will restore you to your soil.

###### v13
But if you _are_ saying, "We will not stay in this land," _so as to_ not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,

###### v14
saying, "No, for we will go _to_ the land of Egypt where we will not see war, and we will not hear _the_ sound of a horn, and we will not be hungry for bread, and there we will stay,"

###### v15
then _therefore_ ^[Literally "to thus"] hear the word of Yahweh, O remnant of Judah. Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: "_If you are determined_ ^[Literally "If you indeed set your face"] to go _to_ Egypt, and you go to dwell as aliens there,

###### v16
then it will be _that_ the sword that you _are_ in fear of will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine that you _are_ anxious of will pursue after you there _into_ Egypt, and there you will die.

###### v17
So all the people who _are determined_ ^[Literally "have set their faces"] to go _to_ Egypt to dwell as aliens there will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague, and there will not be for them an escapee or a survivor from the disaster that I _am_ bringing upon them."

###### v18
For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: "As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will pour out on you at your going _to_ Egypt, and you will become a curse, and a horror, and a curse _formula_, and a disgrace, and you will no longer see this place."'

###### v19
Yahweh has spoken to you, O remnant of Judah, 'You must not go _to_ Egypt.' You must certainly know that I have warned you _today_ ^[Literally "the day"]

###### v20
that _you have made a fatal mistake_, ^[Literally "you have caused them to err for your lives"] for you sent me to Yahweh your God, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Pray for us to Yahweh our God, and all that Yahweh our God says, so tell us and we will do _it_.' ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation]

###### v21
So I have told you _today_, ^[Literally "the day"] and you have not listened to the voice of Yahweh your God, or of _anything_ ^[Literally "all"] that he sent me for you.

###### v22
Now then, certainly you must know that by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague you will die in the place where you desire to go, to dwell as aliens there."
