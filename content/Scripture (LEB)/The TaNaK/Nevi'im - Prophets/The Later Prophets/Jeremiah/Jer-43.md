Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the insolent men spoke, ^[The Hebrew verb is singular] saying to Jeremiah, "You _are_ telling a lie! Yahweh our God did not send you, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'You must not go _to_ Egypt to dwell as aliens there.'

and say to them, 'Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: "Look, I _am_ going to send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden. And he will spread out his canopy over them.

And he will come and ravage the land of Egypt, _and deliver those_ who _are appointed_ for the plague, to the plague, and _those_ who _are appointed_ for the captivity, to the captivity, and _those_ who _are appointed_ for the sword, to the sword.

###### v12
Then he will kindle a fire in the _temples_ ^[Literally "houses"] of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and take them captive. And he will wrap up the land of Egypt just as the shepherd wraps up his cloak. And he will go forth from there in peace.

###### v13
And he will break the stone pillars of Heliopolis, which _is_ in the land of Egypt. And he will burn the _temples_ ^[Literally "houses"] of the gods of Egypt with fire."'"
