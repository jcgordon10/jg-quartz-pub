###### v1
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who were living in the land of Egypt, who were living at Migdol, and Tahpanhes, and Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v2
"Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: 'You yourselves have seen all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the towns of Judah. And look, they _are_ a site of ruins this day, and there is not in them an inhabitant,

###### v3
_because of_ ^[Literally "from the face of"] their wickedness that they committed to provoke me to anger by going to make smoke offerings, serving other gods whom they had not known, _neither_ they, you, or your ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v4
And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, _sending over and over again_, ^[Literally "doing early and sending"] _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "Please, you must not do this detestable thing that I hate."

###### v5
But they did not listen and they did not incline their ears ^[Hebrew "ear"] to turn back from their wickedness, to not make smoke offerings to other gods.

###### v6
So my wrath and my anger were poured out ^[The Hebrew verb is singular] and burned ^[The Hebrew verb is singular] in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became as a site of ruins, as a desolation, as _they are_ this day.'

###### v7
So then, thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Why _are_ you doing great harm to _yourselves_, ^[Literally "your lives"] to cut off for yourselves man and woman, child and suckling, from the midst of Judah, to not leave over for yourselves a remnant,

###### v8
provoking me to anger with the works of your hands, to make smoke offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you _have_ come to dwell as aliens, so as to cut off yourselves, and so that you are becoming as a curse, and as a disgrace among all the nations of the earth?

###### v9
Have you forgotten the wicked things of your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] and the wicked things of the kings of Judah, and the wicked things of their wives, and your wicked things, and the wicked things of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

###### v10
They have not shown contrition up to this day, and they have not shown reverence, and they have not walked in my law and in my statutes that I set _before you_ ^[Literally "to the face of you"] and _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] your ancestors.' ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v11
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: 'Look, _I am determined to bring disaster on you_, ^[Literally "I _am_ setting my face against you for disaster"] even to exterminate all Judah.

###### v12
And I will take _away_ the remnant of Judah _who are determined_ ^[Literally "who set their faces"] to come _to_ the land of Egypt to dwell as aliens there, and everyone will perish. They will fall in the land of Egypt by the sword; they will perish by the famine, from _the_ smallest to _the_ greatest. By the sword and by the famine they will die and become as a curse, as a horror, and as a curse, and as a disgrace.

###### v13
So I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt just as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague.

###### v14
And there will not be a survivor or an escapee of the remnant of Judah, those who have come to dwell as an alien there in the land of Egypt, to return _to_ the land of Judah where they _are_ _longing_ ^[Literally "lifting up their soul"] to return to dwell there, for they will not turn back, _but only_ ^[Literally "but if"] _some_ survivors.'"

###### v15
Then all the men who knew that their wives _were_ making smoke offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood _by_, a great assembly, and all the people who lived in the land of Egypt in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v16
"_Concerning_ the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yahweh, we _are_ not going to listen to you!

###### v17
But certainly we will do _everything_ ^[Literally "all the word"] that went out from our mouths, ^[Hebrew "mouth"] to make smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out to her libations just as we did, we, and our ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] our kings, and our officials, in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, _for_ then _we had enough to eat_, ^[Literally "we satisfied ourselves with food"] and we were well-off, and we did not see disaster.

###### v18
But _since_ ^[Literally "from"] we stopped making smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything, and by the sword and by the famine we have perished.

###### v19
And indeed, _when_ we _were_ making smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and _pouring out_ ^[Literally "to pour out"] to her libations, _was it not_ _with the consent of_ ^[Literally "from apart from"] our husbands _that_ we made for her sacrificial cakes _marked with her image_, ^[Literally "to the copying of her"] and we poured out to her libations?"

###### v20
Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and to the women, and to all the people who answered him a word, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v21
"The offering that you made, smoke offerings in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you, and your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] your kings, and your officials, and the people of the land, _did_ not Yahweh remember them, and _did_ it _not_ come to his _mind_? ^[Literally "heart"]

###### v22
And Yahweh was no longer able to bear ^[Or "endure"] _it_, _because of_ ^[Literally "from the face of"] the evil of your deeds, _because of_ ^[Literally "from the face of"] the detestable things that you committed. Thus your land became as a site of ruins, and as a horror, and as a curse, _without_ ^[Literally "from there is not"] inhabitants, as _it is_ this day.

###### v23
_Because of_ ^[Literally "From the face of"] _the fact_ that you made smoke offerings, and that you sinned against Yahweh, and you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh, and you have not walked in his law, and in his statute, and in his legal provisions, _therefore_ ^[Literally "unto thus"] this disaster has happened to you, as _it is_ this day."

###### v24
Then Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, "Hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who _are_ in the land of Egypt.

###### v25
Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'You and your wives have promised with your mouths ^[Hebrew "mouth"] and with your hands ^[Hebrew "hand"] you have fulfilled, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "We certainly will carry out our vows that we vowed, to make smoke offerings to the queen of the heavens, ^[Hebrew "heaven"] and to pour out to her libations." You must certainly keep your vows and you must certainly carry out your vows.'

###### v26
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah, those who live in the land of Egypt: 'Look, I hereby swear by my great name,' says Yahweh, 'surely my name will no longer be called in the mouth of any man of Judah, saying, "_as the Lord Yahweh lives_," ^[Literally "the life of Lord Yahweh"] in all the land of Egypt.

###### v27
Look, I _am_ going to watch over them for harm and not for good, and all people ^[Or "men"] of Judah who _are_ in the land of Egypt will perish by the sword and by the famine until their perishing.

###### v28
And _the_ survivors of _the_ sword will return from the land of Egypt _to_ the land of Judah _few in number_. ^[Literally "males of number"] And all the remnant of Judah who have come to the land of Egypt to dwell as aliens there will know whose word will endure, from me or from them.

###### v29
And this _will be_ to you the sign,' _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, 'that I _am_ going to punish you in this place, so that you may know that surely my words will endure against you for evil.'

###### v30
Thus says Yahweh: 'Look, I _am_ going to give Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave Zedekiah the king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, his enemy and the one who sought his life.'"
