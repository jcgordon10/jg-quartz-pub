[[Jer-46|Previous Chapter]] | [[Jer-48|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning _the_ Philistines _before_ ^[Literally "at not yet"] Pharaoh attacked Gaza.

###### v2
Thus says Yahweh:
"Look, waters _are_ rising from _the_ north,
and they will become as a raging torrent,
and they will overflow _the_ land,
and that which fills it,
_the_ city and those who live in it.
And the people will cry out,
and every inhabitant of the land will wail,

###### v3
from the sound of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions,
from the clattering of his chariots, ^[Hebrew "chariot"]
the noise of their wheels.
Fathers do not turn to _their_ children
because of _the_ slackness of _their_ hands.

###### v4
Because of the day that is coming
to destroy all _the_ Philistines,
to cut off from Tyre and from Sidon
every survivor _who could_ help,
for Yahweh _is_ destroying _the_ Philistines,
the remnant of the coastland of Caphtor.

###### v5
Baldness has come upon Gaza,
Ashkelon is destroyed.
O remnant of their valley,
_how long_ ^[Literally "until when"] will you cut yourself with a blade?

###### v6
Ah, sword of Yahweh,
_how long_ ^[Literally "until when"] will you not be quiet?
Gather to your sheath,
keep quiet and stand still.

###### v7
How can you be quiet
when Yahweh has given an order to it?
Against Ashkelon and against the shore of the sea,
there he has appointed it."
