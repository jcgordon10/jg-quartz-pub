###### v1
Concerning Moab, thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel:
"Woe to Nebo,
for it is devastated.
It is ashamed,
Kiriathaim is captured.
Misgab is ashamed,
and it is filled with terror.

###### v2
The glory of Moab is no longer.
In Heshbon they planned evil against her.
Come and let us cut her off from _being_ a nation.
Also, Madmen, you will be silent.
After you will go _the_ sword.

###### v3
_The_ sound of a cry of distress _arises_ from Horonaim,
devastation and great destruction.

###### v4
Moab is broken,
her little ones _make heard_ ^[Literally "cause to hear"] a cry for help.

###### v5
For the ascent of Luhith,
in weeping they go weeping,
For on the slope of Horonaim they have heard
_the_ distresses of _the_ cry of distress of _the_ destruction.

###### v6
Flee! Save your life!
_For_ ^[Literally "And"] you must not be like the juniper tree in the desert.

###### v7
For because of your trusting in your works and in your treasures,
even you yourselves will be taken,
and Chemosh will go out into the exile,
his priests and his officials together.

###### v8
And _the_ destroyer will come to every town,
and a town will not escape.
And the valley will be destroyed,
and the plain will be destroyed, as Yahweh has spoken.

###### v9
Give salt for Moab,
for certainly she will go to ruin,
and her towns will become as a desolation,
_without_ ^[Literally "from there is not"] an inhabitant in them.

###### v10
_The one who_ does the work of Yahweh _with_ slackness _is_ cursed,
and _the one who_ keeps away blood from his sword _is_ cursed.

###### v11
Moab has been at ease from his youth,
and he has been quiet on his dregs,
and he has not been poured out from vessel to vessel,
and he has not gone into exile.
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "Unto thus"] his taste has remained unchanged,
and his fragrance has not changed.

###### v12
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] look, days _are_ coming," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and I will send to him _decanters_, ^[Literally "those who tilt"]
and they will decant him,
and his vessels they will empty out,
and their jars they will smash.

###### v13
Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,
just as the house of Israel were ashamed of Bethel, their trust.

###### v14
How can you say, 'we _are_ warriors,
and men of might for the battle.'

###### v15
Moab is destroyed,
and his towns have gone up,
and the choice of his young men have gone down to the slaughtering,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] the King, Yahweh of hosts _is_ his name.

###### v16
"The disaster of Moab _is_ near to come,
and his disaster _approaches very quickly_. ^[Literally "hastens greatly"]

###### v17
Mourn for him, all his surroundings,
and all those who knew his name.
Say, 'How _the_ staff of might is broken,
_the_ staff of glory.'

###### v18
Come down from glory and sit on the parched ground,
O inhabitant, daughter of Dibon,
for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you,
he has destroyed your fortifications.

###### v19
Stand by _the_ road and watch,
O inhabitant of Aroer.
Ask _the man who is_ fleeing and _the woman who is_ escaping,
say, 'What has happened?'

###### v20
Moab is ashamed,
for it is filled with terror.
Wail and cry out,
tell _it_ by Arnon that Moab is devastated.

###### v21
Judgment has also come to the land of the plain, to Holon, and to Jahaz, and on Mephaath,

###### v22
and on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth-diblathaim,

###### v23
and on Kiriathaim, and on Beth-gamul, and on Beth-meon,

###### v24
and on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the towns of the land of Moab, the far and the near.

###### v25
The horn of Moab is cut off and his arm is broken," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v26
"Make him drunk,
because he magnified himself against Yahweh,
and let Moab wallow in his vomit.
And he also will become a laughingstock.

###### v27
Now _was_ not Israel the laughingstock to you?
Or was he found among thieves?
For _as often as_ ^[Literally "from enough"] you spoke over him
you shook _your head_.

###### v28
Leave _the_ towns and dwell on the rock,
O inhabitants of Moab,
and be like _the_ dove,
it nests on _the_ sides of _the_ mouth of a ravine.

###### v29
We have heard _of_ the pride of Moab
--_he is_ very proud--
his height, and his pride, and his arrogance,
and the haughtiness of his heart.

###### v30
I know his insolence," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and his boastings _are_ _false_; ^[Literally "not right"]
they act _falsely_. ^[Literally "not right"]

###### v31
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "Unto thus"] over Moab I wail,
and for all of Moab I cry out,
for the people ^[Or "men"] of Kir-heres I moan.

###### v32
More than the weeping of Jazer
I weep for you, O vine Sibmah.
Your branches cross over _the_ sea,
up to the sea of Jazer they reach.
Upon your summer fruit and upon your vintage
_the_ destroyer has fallen.

###### v33
And joy and rejoicing have been taken away from _the_ fruitful land,
even from the land of Moab.
And _the_ wine from _the_ wine presses
I have caused to disappear.
He will not tread _with_ exuberant shouts. ^[Hebrew "exuberant shout"]
Exuberant shouts ^[Hebrew "Exuberant shout"] _will_ not _be_ exuberant shouts. ^[Hebrew "exuberant shout"]

###### v34
From the cry for help of Heshbon, up to Elealeh,
up to Jahaz, they give their voice,
from Zoar up to Horonaim, _up to_ Eglath-shelishiyah,
for even the waters of Nimrim have become as a desolation.

###### v35
And I will cause to disappear for Moab," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"_the_ one who presents a sacrifice _at_ a high place,
and _the one who_ burns a smoke offering to his gods.

###### v36
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "Unto thus"] my heart moans for Moab like the flute. ^[Hebrew "flutes"]
It moans for the people ^[Or "men"] of Kir-heres like the flute. ^[Hebrew "flutes"]
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "Unto thus"] _the_ wealth they gained has perished.

###### v37
For _on_ every head _is_ baldness,
and every beard is trimmed.
On all _the_ hands, slashes,
and on _the_ loins, sackcloth.

###### v38
On all the roofs of Moab, and in its public squares,
_there is_ wailing everywhere.
For I have broken Moab like a vessel,
there is no delight in it," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v39
"How it is filled with terror! _How_ they wail!
How Moab has turned _his_ back! He is disgraced!
So Moab has become as a derision,
and as a terror for all his surrounding _peoples_."

###### v40
For thus says Yahweh,
"Look, like an eagle he will swoop down,
and he will spread out his wings against Moab.

###### v41
Kerioth will be taken,
and the strongholds will be conquered,
and the hearts ^[Hebrew "heart"] of the warriors of Moab will be on that day
like _the_ heart of a woman _who_ is in labor.

###### v42
And Moab will be destroyed from _being_ a people,
because against Yahweh he magnified himself.

###### v43
Dread, and pit, and a trapping net _are_ against you,
O inhabitant of Moab," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v44
"He _who_ flees _before_ ^[Literally "from the face of"] the dread
will fall into the pit,
and the _one who_ climbs up from the pit
will be caught in the trapping net,
for I will bring on Moab
the year of their punishment," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v45
"In the shadow of Heshbon
fugitives stand without strength,
for a fire has gone out from Heshbon,
and a flame from Sihon.
And it has eaten the forehead of Moab,
and the skulls ^[Hebrew "skull"] of the people ^[Or "sons"] of tumult.

###### v46
Woe to you, Moab!
The people of Chemosh have perished.
For your sons have been taken into captivity,
and your daughters into captivity.

###### v47
Yet I will restore the fortunes ^[Hebrew "fortune"] of Moab
in the last of the days," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.
_Thus far_ ^[Literally "Up to here"] _is_ the judgment of Moab.
