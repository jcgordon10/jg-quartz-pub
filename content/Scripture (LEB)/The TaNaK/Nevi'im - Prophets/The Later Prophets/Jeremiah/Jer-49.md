###### v1
Concerning the _Ammonites_: ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] Thus says Yahweh,

Why has Milcom taken possession of Gad,
and his people dwelled in its towns?

###### v2
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] look, days _are_ coming," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and I will sound against Rabbah, the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"]
_the_ alarm of _the_ war,
and it will become as a mound of desolation,
and its daughters will burn in the fire.
Then Israel will dispossess his dispossessors," says Yahweh.

###### v3
"Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is devastated.
Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah, put on sackcloth.
Lament and run back and forth among the walls.
For Milcom will go into exile,
his priests and his officials together.

Though you make your nest high like the eagle,
from there I will bring you down," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

_everyone who passes by it_ ^[Literally "all _who_ passes by it"] will be appalled,

As the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah
and their neighbors," says Yahweh,
"_no one_ ^[Literally "not a man"] will live there,
and the son of humankind will not dwell as an alien in it.

###### v19
Look, like a lion he comes up from the thickets of the Jordan
to _a pastureland by a constantly flowing stream_. ^[Literally "a pasture of everflowing"]
So _I will chase him away hurriedly_ ^[Literally "I will do in an instant I will chase him away"] from it.

their grazing place.

A cry of distress! Their voice will be heard at _the Red Sea_. ^[Hebrew "Sea of Reeds"]
