###### v1
The word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of _the_ Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet:

###### v2
"Declare among the nations and proclaim,
and lift up a banner.
Proclaim, you must not conceal _it_.
Say, 'Babylon is captured,
Bel is ashamed,
Merodach is filled with terror,
her idols are ashamed,
her idols are filled with terror.

###### v3
For a nation will come up against her from _the_ north.
It will make her land as a horror,
and an inhabitant will not be in her.
From humans ^[Hebrew "human"] to animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] they _all_ will wander _off_.
They will go _away_.

###### v4
In those days and in that time,'" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"the people ^[Or "sons/children"] of Israel will come,
they and the people ^[Or "sons/children"] of Judah together.
_Weeping as they go_, ^[Literally "They shall go and weeping"] they will go,
and Yahweh their God they will seek.

###### v5
They will ask _the_ way _to_ Zion,
_turning_ their faces there.
They will come and join themselves to Yahweh
_by_ _an everlasting covenant_ ^[Literally "a covenant of eternity"] _that_ will not be forgotten.

###### v6
My people have become lost sheep,
their shepherds have caused them to go astray.
They led them away _to the_ mountains.
From mountain to hill they have gone,
they have forgotten their resting place.

###### v7
All _those who_ found them have devoured them.
And their foes have said, 'We are not guilty,
_because_ ^[Literally "under that"] they have sinned against Yahweh, the _true pasture_, ^[Literally "settlement of righteousness"]
even Yahweh, the hope of their ancestors.' ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v8
Flee from the midst of Babylon,
and from the land of _the_ Chaldeans.
Go out and be like he-goats
_before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] _the_ flock.

###### v9
For look, I _am_ going to stir up,
and I _am_ going to bring against Babylon
a contingent of great nations
from _the_ land of _the_ north.
And they will draw up a battle formation against her,
from there she will be captured.
Their arrows _are_ like a warrior _who has_ achieved success,
he does not return without success.

###### v10
And Chaldea will be as booty,
all _those who_ plunder her will be satisfied," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v11
"Though you rejoice, though you exult,
O plunderers of my inheritance,
though you frisk about like a heifer on the grass,
and you neigh like the powerful stallions,

###### v12
your mother will be very ashamed.
_She who_ gave birth _to_ you will be humiliated. ^[Or "ashamed"]
Look, _she will be the_ least of _the_ nations,
a desert, ^[Or "wilderness"] dry land, and wilderness. ^[Or "Arabah"]

###### v13
Because of the anger of Yahweh she will not be inhabited,
but she will be a wasteland, all of her.
Everyone _who_ passes by Babylon will be appalled
and will hiss because of all her wounds.

###### v14
Draw up a battle formation at Babylon all around,
all those who bend _the_ bow, shoot at her.
You must not spare arrows, ^[Hebrew "arrow"]
for she has sinned against Yahweh.

###### v15
Raise a war cry against her on all sides.
_She has surrendered_. ^[Literally "She has given her hand"]
Her towers have fallen,
her walls are ruined.
For this _is_ the vengeance of Yahweh.
Take revenge on her.
As she has done _to others_,
_so_ do to her.

###### v16
Cut off _the_ sower from Babylon,
and _the_ one who uses _the_ sickle in _the_ time of harvest.
_Because of_ ^[Literally "From the face of"] the sword of the oppressor
each one will turn to their people,
and each one will flee to their land.

###### v17
Israel _is_ a sheep scattered,
lions drove _them_ away.
_The_ first who devoured it _was_ the king of Assyria,
and now _at_ the end Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, gnawed its bones."

###### v18
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel,
"Look, I _am_ going to punish the king of Babylon and his land
just as I punished the king of Assyria.

###### v19
And I will restore Israel to its pasture,
and it will feed _on_ Carmel, and _in_ Bashan,
and on the hills ^[Hebrew "hill"] of Ephraim, and _in_ Gilead
its hunger will be satisfied.

###### v20
In those days and at that time," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"the guilt of Israel will be sought, but there _is_ none,
and the sins of Judah, but they will not be found,
for I will forgive those I left behind.

###### v21
To the land of Merathaim,
go up against her,
and against the inhabitants of Pekod,
massacre and destroy them," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and do according to all that I have commanded you.

###### v22
_The_ sound of battle _is_ in the land,
and great destruction.

###### v23
How the blacksmith's hammer of all the earth is cut down and broken!
How Babylon has become as a horror among the nations!

###### v24
I laid a bird snare for you, and you were caught, _O_ Babylon.
But you yourself _did_ not know.
You were discovered and seized,
because with Yahweh you measured yourself.

###### v25
Yahweh has opened his armory,
and he has brought out the weapons of his wrath,
for it _is_ a word for my Lord Yahweh of hosts
in the land of _the_ Chaldeans.

###### v26
Come against her from _the_ end,
open her granaries.
Pile her up like heaps and destroy her.
Let there be no remnant for her.

###### v27
Massacre all her bulls,
let them go down to the slaughtering.
Woe to them, for _their_ day has come,
the time of their punishment.

###### v28
_There is the_ sound of fugitives and survivors
from the land of Babylon,
to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God,
the vengeance for his temple.

###### v29
Summon archers against Babylon,
all those who bend _the_ bow.
Encamp all around her,
there must not be for her an escape.
Take revenge on her according to her deeds.
According to all that she has done, _so_ do to her.
For against Yahweh she has behaved insolently,
against the Holy One of Israel.

###### v30
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] her young men will fall in her public squares,
and all _her soldiers_ ^[Literally "her the men of war"] will perish on that day," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v31
"Look, I _am_ against you, _O_ arrogant _one_,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Lord Yahweh of hosts,
"for your day has come,
_the_ time _when_ I will punish you.

###### v32
And _the_ arrogant _one_ will stumble and fall,
and there is no _one who_ raises _him_ up.
And I will kindle a fire in his cities,
and it will devour everything around him."

###### v33
Thus says Yahweh of hosts:
"The people ^[Or "sons/children"] of Israel _are_ oppressed,
and the people ^[Or "sons/children"] of Judah likewise,
_for_ ^[Literally "and"] all their captors have seized them,
they refuse to let them go free.

###### v34
Their redeemer _is_ strong,
his name _is_ Yahweh of hosts.
Surely he will plead their case,
in order to make peace _for_ the earth,
but to cause unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.

###### v35
A sword against _the_ Chaldeans," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"and against the inhabitants of Babylon,
and against her officials,
and against her wise men.

###### v36
A sword against the oracle priests,
and they will become foolish.
A sword against her warriors,
and they will be filled with terror.

###### v37
A sword against his horses,
and against his chariots, ^[Hebrew "chariot"]
and against all the foreign troops who _are_ in the midst of her,
so that they may become as women.
A sword against her treasures,
so that they may be plundered.

###### v38
A drought _will come_ against her waters,
and they will dry up,
for it _is_ a land of images,
and because of the frightful _objects_, they act like madmen.

###### v39
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] desert creatures will live _there_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] with jackals,
and daughters of ostriches ^[Hebrew "ostrich"] will inhabit her.
And she will not be inhabited again _forever_, ^[Literally "to eternity"]
and she will not be dwelt in _for all generations_. ^[Literally "until generation and generation"]

###### v40
As _when_ God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah
and their neighbors," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"no one will live there,
and _the_ son of humankind will not dwell as an alien in her.

###### v41
Look, a people _is_ about to come
from _the_ north,
and a great nation and many kings are woken up
from _the_ remotest part of _the_ earth.

###### v42
They keep hold of bow and short sword.
They _are_ cruel and they have no mercy.
Their sound _is_ like the sea, it roars,
and upon horses they ride.
Drawn up for battle as a man for the battle,
against you, O daughter of Babylon.

###### v43
The king of Babylon heard their report
and his hands grew slack.
Anxiety has seized him,
fear and pain like the _woman who_ gives birth.

###### v44
Look, like a lion he comes up from the thickets ^[Hebrew "thicket"] of the Jordan
against _a pastureland by a constantly flowing stream_, ^[Literally "a pasture of ever-flowing"]
so _I will chase them away quickly_ ^[Literally "I will do in an instant I will cause them to run"] from her,
and I will appoint whoever _is_ chosen over her.
For who _is_ like me, and who can summon me,
and who _is_ this shepherd who can stand _before me_? ^[Literally "to the face of me"]

###### v45
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] hear the plan of Yahweh
that he has planned against Babylon,
and his plans
that he has planned against the land of _the_ Chaldeans.
_Surely_ ^[Literally "If not"] they will drag them away,
the little _ones_ of the flock.
_Surely_ ^[Literally "If not"] he will cause _their_ grazing place
to be desolate over them.

###### v46
At _the_ sound, 'Babylon has been captured,'
the earth will quake,
and a cry for help among the nations
will be heard."
