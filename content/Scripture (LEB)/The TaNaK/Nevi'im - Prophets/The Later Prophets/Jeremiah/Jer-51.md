###### v1
Thus says Yahweh:
"Look, I _am_ going to stir up against Babylon
and against the inhabitants of Leb-qamai a destructive wind.

###### v2
And I will send winnowers to Babylon,
and they will winnow her,
and they will lay waste her land,
for they will be against her from all sides on _the_ day of disaster.

###### v3
Let not him who bends the bow shoot his bow,
and let him not rise high in his body armor.
And you must not spare her young men;
destroy her whole army.

###### v4
And they will fall slain in the land of _the_ Chaldeans,
and pierced through in her streets.

###### v5
For neither Israel nor Judah _is_ a widower from their God,
from Yahweh of hosts,
though their land is full of guilt
against the Holy One of Israel."

###### v6
Flee from the midst of Babylon and save each one his life.
You must not perish because of her guilt.
For this _is the_ time of vengeance for Yahweh,
he _will_ repay her what is deserved.

###### v7
Babylon _was_ a cup of gold in the hand of Yahweh,
making drunk all the earth.
_The_ nations drank of her wine.
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "Unto thus"] _the_ nations acted like madmen.

###### v8
Suddenly Babylon has fallen and she is shattered.
Wail over her!
Take balm for her wounds,
perhaps she may be healed.

###### v9
We tried to heal Babylon, and she was not healed.
Forsake her and let us go each one to his country,
for her judgment has reached to the heavens,
and it has been lifted up to _the_ skies.

###### v10
Yahweh has brought forth our vindication.
Come and let us make known in Zion the work of Yahweh our God.

###### v11
Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers!
Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes.
Because his plan concerning Babylon _is_ to destroy it,
for that is the vengeance of Yahweh,
the vengeance for his temple.

###### v12
Against the walls of Babylon raise a banner;
_post a strong watch_, ^[Literally "make strong the guard"] post watchmen, prepare the ambushes,
for Yahweh has both planned as well as performed
what he has spoken concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.

###### v13
_O you who_ live by mighty waters, rich in treasures,
your end has come, _the measure of your life_. ^[Literally "the cubit of your severing"]

###### v14
Yahweh of hosts has sworn by himself,
"Surely I will fill you _with_ troops like the creeping locusts, ^[Hebrew "locust"]
and they will sing over you a war cry."

###### v15
_He is the one who_ made _the_ earth by his power,
_the one who_ created _the_ world by his wisdom,
and by his understanding he stretched out _the_ heavens.

###### v16
At the giving of his voice
_there is_ a roar of waters in the heavens,
and he causes _the_ patches of mist
to go up from _the_ end of _the_ earth.
He makes lightning for the rain,
and he brings out _the_ wind from his storehouses.

###### v17
All humankind turns out to be stupid,
without knowledge.
Every goldsmith is put to shame
by _the_ divine image.
For his cast image _is_ a lie,
and _there is_ no breath in them.

###### v18
They _are_ worthless,
a work of mockery.
At the time of their punishment,
they will perish.

###### v19
The portion of Jacob _is_ not like these,
for he _is_ the creator of _everything_, ^[Literally "the all"]
and the tribe of his inheritance.
Yahweh of hosts _is_ his name.

###### v20
_He says_, "You _are_ a war club for me,
a weapon of battle,
and I smash nations with you,
and I destroy kingdoms with you.

###### v21
And I smash _the_ horse with you,
and its rider,
and I smash _the_ chariot with you,
and its rider.

###### v22
And I smash man and woman with you,
and I smash _the_ old man and _the_ boy with you,
and I smash _the_ young man and _the_ young woman with you.

###### v23
And I smash _the_ shepherd and his flock with you,
and I smash _the_ farmer and his team with you,
and I smash _the_ governors and _the_ officials with you.

###### v24
And I will repay Babylon,
and all the inhabitants of Chaldea,
all their wickedness that they have done in Zion
before your eyes," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v25
"Look, I _am_ against you,
O mountain of the destruction," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"the _one_ that destroys the whole earth.
And I will stretch out my hand against you,
and I will roll you down from the cliffs,
and I will make you as a mountain burned away.

###### v26
They will not take from you
a stone for a corner,
and a stone for a foundation,
for you will be _an everlasting desolation_," ^[Literally "a desolation of everlasting"] _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v27
Raise a banner in the land;
blow a horn among the nations;
prepare for holy war against her;
summon _the_ nations against her,
the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz;
summon against her an official;
bring up horses ^[Hebrew "horse"] like bristling creeping locusts. ^[Hebrew "locust"]

###### v28
Prepare _the_ nations for holy war against her,
the kings of the Medes,
with their governors and all their officials,
and every land of their dominion.

for the plans of Yahweh against Babylon stand,
to make the land of Babylon as a horror,
_without_ ^[Literally "from there is not"] inhabitant.

###### v30
The warriors of Babylon have ceased to fight,
they remain in the strongholds,
their power has dried up,
they have become as women.
Her dwelling places are set on fire,
her bars are broken.

###### v31
_one_ runner runs to meet _another_ runner,
and _one_ messenger to meet _another_ messenger,
to tell the king of Babylon that his city has been captured,
_from end to end_. ^[Literally "from end"]

###### v32
And the fords have been seized,
and the reed marshes have been burned with fire,
and _the soldiers_ ^[Literally "the men of the war"] are horrified.

###### v33
For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel,
"The daughter of Babylon _is_ like a threshing floor
_at the_ time it _is_ trodden down,
_just a little while_ ^[Literally "still a little"]
and the time of the harvest will come for her."

###### v34
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
has devoured me _and_ sucked me dry;
he has made me an empty vessel;
he has swallowed me like the sea monster;
he has filled his belly with my delicacies;
he has rinsed me.

###### v35
"_May_ the violence done to me and to my flesh _be_ on Babylon,"
the inhabitants ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"] of Zion will say;
and "My blood _be_ upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,"
Jerusalem will say.

###### v36
_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] thus says Yahweh,
"Look, I _am_ going to contend your case,
and I will avenge your vengeance,
and I will cause her sea to dry up,
and I will cause her fountain to dry up.

a lair of jackals,
_an object of_ horror, and _an object of_ hissing,

they will growl like the cubs of lions.

At their becoming hot I will set their banquets,
and I will make them drunk,
so that they will fall into a swoon,
and they will sleep _an everlasting sleep_, ^[Literally "a sleep of eternity"]
and they will not wake up," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v40
"I will bring them down like young rams to slaughter,
like rams and goats.

###### v41
How Sheshach is captured,
and the glory of all the earth is seized!
How Babylon has become as an _object of_ horror
among the nations!

###### v42
The sea has risen over Babylon,
she has been covered by the roar of its waves.

###### v43
Her cities have become as an _object of_ horror,
a dry land and a wilderness, ^[Or "Arabah"]
a land in which no person lives,
nor does a son of humankind pass through it.

###### v44
And I will punish Bel in Babylon,
and I will wrench out from his mouth _what he has swallowed_. ^[Literally "what has been swallowed by him"]

Come out from her midst, my people,
and save each one his life
from _the burning anger of_ ^[Literally "the blazing of the nose of"] Yahweh.

###### v46
Now _so that you are not fainthearted_, ^[Literally "so that your heart is not timid"]
and you are afraid at the rumors ^[Hebrew "rumor"] that are heard in the land--
and in the year the rumor comes,
and in the year after it the rumor,
and violence _is_ in the land,
with ruler against ruler--

###### v47
_therefore_ ^[Literally "to thus"] look, days _are_ coming,
and I will punish the images of Babylon,
and all her land will be put to shame,
and all her slain ones will fall in the midst of her.

Then _the_ heaven and _the_ earth and all that _is_ in them
will shout for joy over Babylon,
for from _the_ north
the destroyers will come to it," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v49
Babylon must fall not only _because of_ the slain ones of Israel,
but also because of Babylon the slain ones of all the earth have fallen.

###### v50
Survivors of _the_ sword, go!
You must not linger!
Remember Yahweh from far _away_,
and let Jerusalem come to your _mind_. ^[Literally "heart"]

We are ashamed,
for we have heard taunts, ^[Hebrew "taunt"]
disgrace covers our faces,
for strangers have come to the holy places of the house of Yahweh.

###### v52
"_Therefore_ ^[Literally "To thus"] look, days _are_ coming," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,

and though she fortifies the high place of her strength,
from me destroyers will come to her," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.

_The_ sound of a cry for help from Babylon,
and a great collapse from the land of _the_ Chaldeans.

Their waves roar like mighty waters,
the roar of their voices ^[Hebrew "voice"] resounds.

For a destroyer _is_ coming against her, against Babylon,
and her warriors are captured.
Their bows are broken;
for Yahweh _is_ a God of recompense,
certainly he will repay.

"And I will make drunk her officials, and her wise men,
her governors, and her officials, and her warriors,

###### v58
Thus says Yahweh of hosts:
"The broad walls of Babylon will be utterly demolished,
and her high gates will burn with fire,

and they will grow weary."

###### v59
The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah, the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, at his going with Zedekiah, the king of Judah, _to_ Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah _was the_ _quartermaster_. ^[Literally "official of _the_ resting place"]

###### v60
And Jeremiah wrote all the disasters ^[Hebrew "disaster"] that would come on Babylon in one scroll, all these words that are written concerning Babylon.

###### v61
And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, "At your coming _to_ Babylon, then you must see _that_ you read aloud all these words.

###### v62
And you must say, 'Yahweh, you yourself spoke against this place, to destroy it, so that _there will_ not be in it _anything_ living, from humankind to animals, ^[Hebrew "animal"] for it will be _an everlasting desolation_.' ^[Literally "a desolation of eternity"]

###### v63
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] when you finish reading aloud this scroll, you must tie a stone on it, and you must throw it into the middle of _the_ Euphrates.

###### v64
And you must say, 'Babylon will sink, and she will not rise, _because of_ ^[Literally "from"] the face of the disasters ^[Hebrew "disaster"] that I _am_ bringing on her, and they will grow weary.'" _Thus far_ ^[Literally "Up to here"] the words of Jeremiah.
