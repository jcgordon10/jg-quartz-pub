Hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you, O people of Israel, against the whole clan that I brought up from the land of Egypt: ^[Hebrew "Egypt, saying"]

###### v3
Do two walk together unless they have met?

###### v4

###### v5
Does a bird fall into a trapping net on the earth when there is no snare for it? Does a trapping net spring up from the ground unless it has certainly caught something?

Therefore, thus says my Lord Yahweh, "A foe shall surround the land and bring down your strongholds, and your citadel fortresses shall be plundered."

###### v12
Thus says Yahweh, "Just as the shepherd rescues two legs or a piece of an ear from the mouth of the lion, so shall the _people_ ^[Literally "children"] of Israel who dwell in Samaria, with the corner of a couch and the damask of a bed."

###### v13
"Listen and testify against the house of Jacob," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] my Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts.

I will ruin the winter house as well as the summer house, and the houses of ivory will perish and the great houses shall come to an end," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh.
