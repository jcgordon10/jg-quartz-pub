###### v1
Hear this word that I _am_ going to intone over you _as_ a lament, O house of Israel!

###### v2
Virgin Israel has fallen and will not rise again. She is deserted on her land; there is no one to raise her up.

###### v3
For thus says my Lord Yahweh, "The city that marches out _with_ a thousand will _only_ have a hundred left. And the one that marches out _with_ a hundred will _only_ have ten left for the house of Israel."

###### v4
For thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel, "Seek me so that you may live."

###### v5
But do not seek Bethel or go _to_ Gilgal or cross over to Beersheba, for Gilgal will certainly go into exile and Bethel will come to disaster."

###### v6
Seek Yahweh so that you may live, so that he will not break out like a fire _against_ the house of Joseph! And it will devour, _with none to quench_ ^[Literally "and there is not one to quench"] _it_ for Bethel.

###### v7
_Ah,_ you who turn justice into wormwood and hurl righteousness to the ground!

###### v8
The one who made the Pleiades and Orion and who turns deep darkness into the morning and darkens day _into_ night, the one who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the surface of the earth, Yahweh _is_ his name!

###### v9
The one who makes destruction flash upon _the_ fierce, _so that_ ^[Literally "and"] destruction comes upon _the_ fortification.

###### v10
They hate the one who reproves in the gate and they abhor the one who speaks honestly.

###### v11
Therefore, because you trample on _the_ poor and you take a grain tax from them, you built houses of dressed stone, but you will not live in them. You built vineyards of delightfulness, but you will not drink their wine.

###### v12
For I know your transgressions _are_ many and your sins _are_ numerous, _you_ foes of _the_ righteous, those who take a bribe, and _those who_ ^[Literally "they"] push aside _the_ poor _ones_ in the gate!

###### v13
Therefore, whoever has insight will keep silent in that time, for it _is_ a time of evil.

###### v14
Seek good and not bad in order that you may live, and so Yahweh, the God of hosts, will be with you, as you have said.

###### v15
Hate evil and love good and establish justice in the gate; perhaps Yahweh, the God of hosts, will be gracious _to_ the remnant of Joseph.

###### v16
Therefore, thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, my Lord, "In all _of_ the public squares _there will be_ wailing, and in all _of_ the streets _they will say_, 'Alas, alas, alas!' They shall call _the_ farmers to mourning and _to_ wailing, to those who are skilled _in_ lamentation.

###### v17
And in all _of the_ vineyards _there will be_ wailing, because I will pass in your midst," says Yahweh.

###### v18
Alas, those who desire the day of Yahweh, why _is_ this for you the day of Yahweh? It _will be_ darkness and not light!

###### v19
_It will be_ as _if_ a man fled from a lion and a bear met him; or he went _into_ the house and leaned his hand against the wall and a snake bit him.

###### v20
_Is_ not the day of Yahweh darkness and not light, and pitch dark with no brightness in it?

###### v21
"I hate, I despise your festivals, and I take no delight in your assemblies.

###### v22
Yes, _even_ if you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept _them_, and I will not look at the fellowship offerings of your fattened animals.

###### v23
Remove from me the noise of your songs, and I do not want to hear the melody of your harps!

###### v24
But let justice roll on like the water, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.

###### v25
Did you bring to me sacrifices and offering_s_ those forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?

###### v26
And you will take up Sikkuth, your king, and Kaiwan, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves.

###### v27
And I will deport you beyond Damascus," says Yahweh--the God of hosts _is_ his name.
