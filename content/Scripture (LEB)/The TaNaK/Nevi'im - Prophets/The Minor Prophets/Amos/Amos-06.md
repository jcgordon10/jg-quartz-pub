[[Amos-05|Previous Chapter]] | [[Amos-07|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Alas _for_ those being at ease in Zion, and those who feel secure on Mount Samaria, the notables of the best of the nations! The house of Israel resorts to them.

###### v2
Cross over _to_ Calneh and see, and go from there _to_ Hamath Rabbah and go down _to_ Gath of the Philistines. _Are_ you better than these kingdoms, or is their territory greater than your territory?

###### v3
You that put off the day of disaster and bring near a reign of violence!

###### v4
_Alas for_ those who lie on beds of ivory and lounge on their couches, and those eating young rams from _the_ sheep and goats, and bull-calves from the middle of _the_ animal stall.

###### v5
_Alas for those_ who sing to the tune of the harp; like David they improvise on instruments of music.

###### v6
_Alas for those_ who drink from sprinkling bowls of wine and anoint themselves with the best of olive oils and are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph.

###### v7
Therefore, they shall now go into exile at the head of the exiles and the feast of lounging shall pass away.

###### v8
My Lord Yahweh has sworn by himself, _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, the God of hosts: "I abhor the pride of Jacob and I hate his citadel fortresses and I will deliver _the_ city and its fullness!"

###### v9
And then if ten people remain in one house, they too will die.

###### v10
And _if_ one's relative, who burns _the body_, lifts it up and brings the body out of the house and he will say to someone in the innermost part of the house, "_Are there_ any more with you?" and he will say, "None," then he will say, "Silence," because _we_ must not invoke the name of Yahweh.

###### v11
Look, Yahweh _is_ going to command and the great house will be destroyed _to_ bits and the little house _to_ pieces.

###### v12
Do horses run on rocks, or does one plow the sea with oxen? ^[Or "does one plow them with oxen"] But you have turned justice into poison and _the_ fruit of righteousness into wormwood!

###### v13
_You_ who rejoice over Lo-Debar, who say, "Have we not taken Karnaim for ourselves by our strength?"

###### v14
Indeed, I _am_ going to raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh, the God of hosts. And they shall oppress you from Lebo-hamath up to the wadi of the Arabah.
