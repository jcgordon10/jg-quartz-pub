###### v1
This is what my Lord Yahweh showed me, and look, _he_ is going to form locusts at the beginning of the sprouting of the second crop, and look, after the mowings of the king.

###### v2
And then when they ^[Hebrew "he/it"] finished eating the vegetation of the land, I said, "O Lord Yahweh, please forgive! How can Jacob stand, because he _is_ small?"

###### v3
Yahweh relented concerning this. "It will not be," said Yahweh.

###### v4
This is what my Lord Yahweh showed me, and look, my Lord Yahweh was going to call for a legal case with fire, and it devoured the great deep and it ate up the plots of ground.

###### v5
Then I said, "_O_ Lord Yahweh, please stop! How can Jacob stand, because he _is_ small?"

###### v6
Yahweh also relented concerning this. "This also will not be," said my Lord Yahweh.

###### v7
This is what he showed me: Behold, my Lord _was_ standing beside a wall _built with_ a plummet, and a plummet _was_ in his hand.

###### v8
And Yahweh said to me, "What do you see?" And I said, "A plummet." And my Lord said, "Look, I _am_ going to set a plummet in the midst of my people, Israel. I will not pass them by again.

###### v9
The high places of Isaac shall become desolate and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste. And I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword."

###### v10
Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam the king of Israel, saying, "Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to endure all of his words.

###### v11
For this Amos has said, 'Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly go into exile _away_ from his land.'"

###### v12
And Amaziah said to Amos, "_O_ seer, go, flee to the land of Judah and earn food there and prophesy there!"

###### v13
But do not prophesy again at Bethel, because this _is_ a sanctuary of a king and this _is_ a temple of a kingdom."

###### v14
And Amos answered and said to Amaziah, "I am not a prophet and I _am_ not a son of a prophet, but I _am_ a herdsman and I am one taking care of sycamore trees.

###### v15
And Yahweh took me from _following_ behind the sheep and goats and Yahweh said to me, "Go, prophesy to my people Israel!

###### v16
And so then, hear the word of Yahweh! You are saying, 'You must not prophesy against Israel and you must not preach against the house of Isaac!'

###### v17
Therefore, thus says Yahweh, 'Your wife will become a prostitute in the city and your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword and your land will be divided with a line, and you ^[Emphatic second person pronoun] will die in an unclean land and Israel will surely go into exile from this land.'"
