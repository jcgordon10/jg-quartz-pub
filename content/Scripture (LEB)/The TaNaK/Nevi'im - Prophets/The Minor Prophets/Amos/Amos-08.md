###### v4
Hear this, those who trample on _the_ poor and who annihilate the afflicted of _the_ land,

###### v5
saying, "When will the new moon be over, so that we can sell grain? And the Sabbath, so that we can open the grain bins, that we can make _the_ ephah small and make _the_ shekel large, and can practice deceit _with_ a set of scales of deceit?

###### v6
_That we can_ ^[Literally "to buy"] buy _the_ powerless with silver and _the_ poor for the sake of a pair of sandals, and we can sell the waste of the grain?"

###### v11
Look, the days are coming," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] my Lord Yahweh, "when I will send a famine in the land, not a famine for bread and not a thirst for water, but _of hearing_ ^[Literally "but if to hear"] the words of Yahweh!

###### v12
And they will wander from sea to sea and from _the_ north and to _the_ east. They will roam about to seek the word of Yahweh, but they will not find _it_!

###### v14
