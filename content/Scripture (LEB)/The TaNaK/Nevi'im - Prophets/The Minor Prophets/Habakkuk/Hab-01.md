[[Hab-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.

###### v2
O Yahweh, how long shall I cry for help
and you will not listen?
_How long_ will I cry out to you, "Violence!"
and you will not save?

###### v3
Why do you cause me to see evil
_while_ you look at trouble?
Destruction and violence happen before me;
contention and strife arise.

###### v4
Therefore the law is paralyzed,
and justice does not go forth perpetually. ^[Or "forever"]
For the wicked surround the righteous;
therefore justice goes forth perverted.

###### v5
"Look among the nations and see;
be astonished and astounded.
For a work _is about to_ be done in your days
that you will not believe if it is told.

###### v6
For look! I am raising up the Chaldeans,
the bitter and impetuous nation,
the one who walks through the spacious places of earth
to take possession of dwellings not belonging to it. ^[Or "him"]

###### v7
They ^[Hebrew "He"] _are_ dreadful and awesome;
their ^[Hebrew "his"] justice and their ^[Hebrew "his"] dignity proceed from themselves. ^[Hebrew "him"]

###### v8
Their ^[Hebrew "His"] horses _are_ more swift than leopards;
they are more menacing than wolves _at_ dusk.
Their ^[Hebrew "His"] horsemen gallop; their ^[Hebrew "his"] horsemen come from afar;
they fly like an eagle _that is_ swift to devour.

###### v9
All of them ^[Hebrew "him"] come for violence,
their faces pressing forward.
They gather captives like the sand.

###### v10
And they themselves scoff at kings
and rulers _are_ a joke to them.
They laugh at every fortification,
and they heap up earth and take it.

###### v11
Then they sweep _like the_ wind and pass on;
they become guilty, whose might _is_ their ^[Hebrew "his"] god!"

###### v12
Are you not from of old,
O Yahweh my God, my Holy One?
You ^[Hebrew "we shall not die," considered a deliberate scribal change of the text to avoid offensive language toward Yahweh] shall not die.
O Yahweh, you have marked them ^[Hebrew "him"] for judgment;
O Rock, you have established them ^[Hebrew "him"] for reproof.

###### v13
Your eyes _are_ too pure to see evil,
and you are not able to look at wrongdoing. ^[Or "trouble"]
Why do you look at the treacherous?
_Why_ are you silent when the wicked swallows up
_someone_ more righteous than him?

###### v14
You make humankind like fish of the sea,
like crawling creatures that have no ruler among them.

###### v15
He brings up all of them with a fishhook;
he drags them up with a fishnet;
he gathers them in his dragnet.
Therefore, he rejoices and exults.

###### v16
Therefore he sacrifices to his fishnet
and makes offerings to his dragnet,
for by them _he makes a good living_ ^[Literally "his portion is fat"]
and his food _is_ rich.

###### v17
Will he therefore empty his fishnet
and continually kill nations without showing mercy?
