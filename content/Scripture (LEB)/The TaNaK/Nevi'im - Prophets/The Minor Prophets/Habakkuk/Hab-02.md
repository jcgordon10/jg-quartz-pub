###### v1
I will stand at my post,
and station myself on _the_ rampart.
And I will keep watch to see what he will say to me,
and what he will answer concerning my complaint.

###### v2
Then Yahweh answered me and said,
"Write _the_ vision and make _it_ plain on the tablet
so that _it might be read quickly_. ^[Literally "it might run reading upon it"]

###### v3
For _there is_ yet a vision for the appointed time;
it will give witness to the end, and it will not lie.
If it tarries, wait for it,
for it will surely come and not delay.

###### v4
Look! His spirit within him is puffed up;
it is not upright.
But the righteous shall live by his faithfulness.

###### v5
_How much less_ ^[Literally "And moreover because"] the defiant; ^["Defiant" follows the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QpHab)]
_the_ arrogant, treacherous man?
He who broadens his throat like Sheol,
and who, like death, is not satisfied,
and who gathers to himself all the nations,
and harvested for himself all the peoples,
will not succeed.

###### v6
Shall not all of these take up a taunt against him,
with ridicule and riddles against him, saying,
'Woe to him who heaps up what is not his'?
_For_ how long?
And, '_Woe to him_ who makes himself heavy with pledges'?

###### v7
Will not your creditors suddenly rise up
and awaken those who make you tremble?
Then you shall be as plunder for them.

###### v8
Because you plundered many nations,
all the remaining nations will plunder you
on account of the blood of humanity
and violence _against the_ land,
_and against_ cities and all who live in them.

###### v9
Woe to _him who_ obtains profit _from_ evil gain for his house,
to set his nest on high,
to be saved from the hand of misfortune!

###### v10
You have plotted shame for your house,
cutting off many peoples
and sinning against your life.

###### v11
For the stone will cry out from the wall,
and _the_ plaster from _the_ wood will answer it.

###### v12
Woe to _him who_ builds a city by bloodguilt,
and _who_ founds a city by wickedness!

###### v13
Look! _Is it_ not from Yahweh of hosts
that people labor for mere fire,
and nations exhaust themselves for mere vanity?

###### v14
For the earth will be filled
with the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh,
like the waters covering the sea.

###### v15
Woe to _him who_ gives a drink to his neighbors,
pouring out your wrath and also making _them_ drunk
in order to see their nakedness!

###### v16
You will be sated with shame rather than glory.
Drink also yourself, and expose yourself!
The cup of the right hand of Yahweh
will come around upon you
and disgrace upon your glory.

###### v17
For _the_ violence of Lebanon will cover you,
and _the_ destruction of wild animals will shatter them
on account of the blood of humanity,
and _the_ violence _against the_ land,
_against_ a city and all the inhabitants in it.

###### v18
What value _is_ an idol
when its carver has fashioned it,
a molten idol, a teacher of lies?
For _he who_ fashioned his creation trusts in it,
_though_ making mute idols!

###### v19
Woe to _him who_ says to the wood, 'Wake up!'
_And_ to a lifeless stone, 'Arise!'
Can he teach?
Look, it is covered _with_ gold and silver,
and there is no breath within it.

###### v20
But Yahweh _is_ in his holy temple.
Let all the earth be silent before him."
