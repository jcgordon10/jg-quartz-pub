[[Hab-02|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.

###### v2
O Yahweh, I have heard the report of you;
O Yahweh, I stand in awe of your works.
In the midst of the years, revive it!
In the midst of the years, make _it_ known!
In wrath, may you remember to show compassion.

###### v3
God came from Teman;
the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah
His splendor covers the heavens,
and his praise fills the earth.

###### v4
And his brightness was like _the_ light;
flashing rays _came_ from his hand for him;
And there _is_ the covering of his strength.

###### v5
Before him went Disease, ^[The Hebrew term is also the name of a Canaanite deity]
and Pestilence ^[The Hebrew term is also the name of a Canaanite deity] went out at his feet.

###### v6
He stood and measured the earth;
he looked and made the nations tremble.
Then the mountains of old were shattered;
the hills of old collapsed.
The ways of old belong to him.

###### v7
Under affliction I saw the tents of Cushan;
the tent curtains of the land of Midian trembled.

###### v8
Was the anger of Yahweh against the rivers?
Was your wrath against the rivers,
or your fury against the sea,
when you mounted upon your horses,
upon your victory chariot?

###### v9
You laid bare the nakedness of your bow,
swearing oaths _with the_ arrows of _your_ word.
You split the earth _with_ rivers.

###### v10
_When the_ mountains saw you they writhed;
a torrent of waters swept by;
the deep gave its voice;
it raised its hands on high.

###### v11
Sun _and_ moon stood still in _their_ place;
at the light of your arrows they moved about;
at the gleam of the flashing of your spear.

###### v12
In fury you marched through _the_ earth;
in anger you trampled the nations.

###### v13
You went forth for the salvation of your people,
for the salvation of your anointed.
You crushed the head of the house of wickedness,
laying bare _from the_ foundation to the top. ^[Or "to the neck"]

###### v14
You pierced the head of his warriors with his own arrows;
they came like a whirlwind to scatter me,
their exultation like _one who_ devours the afflicted in ambush.

###### v15
You trampled upon the sea _with_ your horses,
the churning of many waters.

###### v16
I hear and my stomach shakes;
my lips quiver at the sound;
infection enters my bones;
that which _is_ beneath me trembles;
I wait quietly for the day of trouble
to come upon the people attacking us.

###### v17
Though the fig tree _does_ not blossom,
nor there be fruit on the vines;
the yield of _the_ olive tree fails,
and the cultivated fields do not yield food;
_the_ flock is cut off from the animal pen,
and there is no cattle in the stalls,

###### v18
Yet I will rejoice in Yahweh;
I will exult in the God of my salvation.

###### v19
Yahweh, my Lord, _is_ my strength;
he makes my feet like the deer;
he causes me to walk on my high places.
To the choirmaster with stringed instruments.
