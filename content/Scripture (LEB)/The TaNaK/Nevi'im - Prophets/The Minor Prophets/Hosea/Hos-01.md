[[Hos-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.

###### v2
_At the beginning when Yahweh spoke_ ^[Literally "_At_ the beginning of the talking of Yahweh"] through Hosea,
Yahweh said to Hosea,
"Go, take for yourself a wife and children of whoredom,
because the land commits great whoredom
_forsaking Yahweh_." ^[Literally "from behind Yahweh"]

###### v3
So he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim,
and she conceived and bore him a son.

###### v4
And Yahweh said to him,
"_Name him_ ^[Literally "Call his name"] Jezreel; ^[Jezreel means "God sows"]
because in a little while _I will punish_ ^[Literally "I will visit sin upon"] the house of Jehu ^[Or "the dynasty of Jehu"]
for the blood ^[Or "bloodshed"] of Jezreel, ^[Jezreel means "God sows"]
and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. ^[Or "the dynasty of Israel"]

###### v5
_On that day_ ^[Literally "And it will happen on that day"]
I will break the bow of Israel
in the Valley of Jezreel."

###### v6
And she conceived again and bore a daughter, and he ^[Yahweh] said to him,
"_Name her_ ^[Literally "Call her name"] Lo-ruhamah, ^[Lo-ruhamah means "Not pitied"]
for I will no longer have pity
on the house of Israel
or _forgive them_. ^[Literally "raise them up"]

###### v7
But I will have pity _on_ the house of Judah
and I will save them by Yahweh their God,
and will not deliver them
by bow, sword, war,
horses, or horsemen.

###### v8
And when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, ^[Lo-ruhamah means "Not pitied"] she conceived and bore a son.

###### v9
And he ^[Yahweh] said, "_Name him_ ^[Literally "Call his name"] Lo-ammi, ^[Lo-ammi means "not my people"]
for you _are_ not my people
and I am not your _God_. ^[Hebrew "not yours"]

###### v10
 ^[[[Hos-01#v10|Hosea 1:10–2:23]] in the English Bible is 2:1–25 in the Hebrew Bible] The number of the children of Israel
will be like the sand of the sea
that cannot be measured or counted;
and in the place where it is said to them,
"You are not my people,"
it will be said to them,
"Children of _the_ living God."

###### v11
Then the children of Judah
and Israel will be gathered together,
and they will appoint for themselves
one head;
and _they will take possession of_ ^[Literally "they will go up from"] the land,
for great _is_ the day of Jezreel. ^[Jezreel means "God sows"]
