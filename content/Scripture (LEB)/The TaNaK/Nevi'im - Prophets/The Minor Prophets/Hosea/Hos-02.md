[[Hos-01|Previous Chapter]] | [[Hos-03|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Say to your brother, ^[Hebrew "brothers"] "Ammi," ^[Ammi means "My people"]
and to your sister, ^[Hebrew "sisters"] "Ruhamah." ^[Ruhamah means "Pitied"]

###### v2
Plead with your mother, plead--
because she _is_ not my wife,
and I _am_ not her husband.
Let her put away her whoring _from before her_, ^[Literally "from her face"]
and her adultery from between her breasts.

###### v3
Lest I strip her naked
and expose her like the day when she was born;
I will make her like the desert
and turn her into parched land;
I will kill her with thirst.

###### v4
And I will not have pity on her children,
because _they are_ children of whoredom.

###### v5
        Because their mother was unfaithful; ^[Or "their mother played the whore"]
she who conceived them has acted shamefully,
for she said:
"I will go after my lovers,
the ones who give _me_ my bread, my water,
my wool, and my flax,
my oil, and my drink."

###### v6
Therefore, Look!
I _am_ going to hedge her path ^[Hebrew "your path"] _with thorns_, ^[Literally "with the thorns"]
and I will build a stone wall, a stone wall _against_ her,
and she will not find her paths.

###### v7
Then she will pursue _her lovers_, ^[Literally "the ones who love her"]
but she will not overtake them;
she will seek them and not find _them_;
and she will say, "I will go
and return to my first husband
because _it was_ better for me then than now."

###### v8
But she did not know
that _it was_ I who gave her
grain, new wine, and oil,
and who gave her silver in abundance,
and gold which they made into a Baal.

###### v9
Therefore I will take again
my grain in its time,
and my wine in its season;
and I will take away my wool and my flax,
_which were_ to cover her nakedness.

###### v10
And now I will uncover her nakedness
before the eyes of her lovers,
and no one will rescue her from my hand.

###### v11
And I will put an end to all her mirth,
her festivals, ^[Hebrew "festival"] her new moons, ^[Hebrew "new moon"] and her Sabbaths, ^[Hebrew "Sabbath"]
and all her appointed festivals; ^[Hebrew "festival"]

###### v12
and I will lay waste to her vines ^[Hebrew "vine"] and her fig trees, ^[Hebrew "fig tree"]
of which she said,
"They _are_ my payment for prostitution,
which my lovers gave to me."
I will make them a forest,
and the wild animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] of the field will devour them.

###### v13
_I will punish her_ ^[Literally "To visit sins upon her;" see 1:4] _for_ the days of the Baals,
to whom she burns incense,
and she decked herself _with_ her ornamental ring and jewelry,
and she went after her lovers, and forgot me
--a declaration of Yahweh.

###### v14
Therefore, Look! I _am_ going to allure her
and bring her _into_ the desert,
and _I will speak tenderly to her_. ^[Literally "I will speak to her heart"]

###### v15
From there I will give her
her vineyards,
and the Valley of Achor as a doorway of hope.
And there she will respond,
as _in_ the days of her youth,
just as _in_ the day of her coming out of
the land of Egypt.

###### v16
_And on that day_-- ^[Literally, "And it will happen on that day"]
a declaration of Yahweh--
you will call me, "My husband;" ^[Hebrew "Ishi"]
you will no longer call me, "My Baal." ^[Hebrew "Baali"]

###### v17
I will remove the names
of the Baals from her mouth,
and they will no longer be mentioned by their name.

###### v18
I will make a covenant for them on that day,
with the animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] of the field,
with the birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of the heaven, and
_with_ the creeping things ^[Hebrew "creeping thing"] of the ground;
_the_ bow, _the_ sword, and _the_ war I will abolish from the land, and I will let them lie down in safety.

###### v19
And I will take you as my wife forever;
I will take you as a wife for myself in righteousness and in justice,
in steadfast love and in mercy.

###### v20
_I will take you as my wife_ ^[Literally "I will take you as a wife to me"] in faithfulness,
and you will know Yahweh.

###### v21
On that day I will answer, _declares Yahweh_, ^[Literally "a declaration of Yahweh]
I will answer the heavens,
and they will answer the earth.

###### v22
And the earth will answer
the grain, the wine, and the oil,
and they will answer Jezreel. ^[Jezreel means "God sows"]

###### v23
    I will sow her for myself in the land;
I will have pity on Lo-ruhama; ^[Lo-ruhama means "Not pitied"]
I will say to Lo-ammi, ^[Lo-ammi means "Not my people"]
"You are my people,"
and he himself will say, "_you are_ my God."
