###### v1
And Yahweh said to me again,
"Go, love a woman
_who has a lover_ ^[Literally "_who is_ beloved of a friend"] and _is_ committing adultery,
just like the love of Yahweh _for_ the children of Israel,
but they _are_ turning to other gods
and love raisin cakes."

###### v2
So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver
and a homer of barely and a measure of wine. ^[Hebrew "a measure of barley"; the LXX has "a nebel of wine," although some modern translations, e.g. NASB, have "a homer and a half of barley"]

###### v3
And I said to her,
"_You must remain as mine_ ^[Literally "You must sit _at home_ for me"] for many days,
and you will not play the whore;
_you will not belong_ ^[Literally "you will not be"] to a man,
and I _will_ belong to you."

###### v4
The children of Israel will remain for many days
without a king and prince,
without sacrifice and stone pillar, ephod and teraphim.

###### v5
Afterward the children of Israel will return
and seek Yahweh their God and David their king.
They will come in fear to Yahweh
and to his goodness at the end of days.
