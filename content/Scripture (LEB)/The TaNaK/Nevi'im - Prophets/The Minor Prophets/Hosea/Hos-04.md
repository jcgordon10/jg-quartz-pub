###### v1
Hear the word of Yahweh, _O_ children of Israel,
for Yahweh has an indictment against the inhabitants of the land.
There is no faithfulness or loyalty,
there is no knowledge of God in the land.

###### v2
Swearing and lying,
murdering and stealing,
and adultery break out, ^[The LXX adds "and adultery breaks out in the land"]
and bloodshed follows bloodshed.

###### v3
Therefore the land mourns,
and all _those_ living in it languish
with the animals of the field,
and the birds of the heaven,
and even the fish of the sea
are being swept away.

###### v4
Yet, let no one contend,
and let no one accuse,
for with you, O priest, _is my_ contention. ^[The Hebrew is unclear; the NASB translates "For your people are like those who contend with the priest"]

###### v5
You will stumble _by_ day,
and the priest also will stumble
with you at night.
And I will destroy your mother;

###### v6
    My people are destroyed
for lack of knowledge;
because you have rejected knowledge,
I reject you from acting as a priest for me. ^[Or "to me"]
And since you have forgotten the law of your God,
I will also forget your children. ^[Hebrew "sons"]

###### v7
When they became many, their sin increased against me;
they changed ^[Hebrew uncertain; MT "I will exchange"] their glory into shame.

###### v8
_They feed on the sin of my people_, ^[Literally "They eat the sins of my people"]
_they are greedy_ ^[Literally "they lift up their throat"] for their iniquity.

###### v9
And it will be like people, like priest;
I will punish them ^[Hebrew "him"] _for_ their ^[Hebrew "his"] ways,
and I will requite them ^[Hebrew "him"] for their ^[Hebrew "his"] deeds.

###### v10
They will eat and not be satisfied;
they will play the whore and not multiply,
because they have forsaken Yahweh _to devote themselves to_
_

###### v11
    whoredom_. ^[Literally "to watch over whoredom"]
Wine and new wine _take away the understanding_. ^[Literally "take away heart"]

###### v12
    My people,
consult _their wooden idols_, ^[Literally "their wood"]
and their divining rod gives them oracles;
because a spirit of whoredom led _them_ astray,
and they played the whore from under their God. ^[That is, "they played the whore forsaking their God"; See [[Ezek-23#v5|Ezek 23:5]]]

###### v13
On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice,
and on the hills they make offerings,
under oak, poplar, and terebinth,
because their ^[Hebrew "its"] shade is good.
Therefore your daughters play the whore,
and all your daughters-in-law ^[Or "brides"] commit adultery.

###### v14
_I will not punish your daughters_ ^[Literally "I will not visit sins upon your daughters"] when they play the whore,
or your daughters-in-law ^[Or "brides"] when they commit adultery;
because they go aside with whores,
and they sacrifice with temple prostitutes,
a people that does not understand comes to ruin.

###### v15
Even though you, _O_ Israel, _are_ playing the whore,
do not let Judah become guilty;
do not enter Gilgal,
or go up _to_ Beth-aven;
and do not swear,
"_As Yahweh lives_!" ^[Literally "the life of Yahweh"]

###### v16
Indeed, like a stubborn heifer,
Israel is stubborn;
Now Yahweh will feed them,
like a lamb in broad pasture. ^[Or "Can Yahweh feed them, like a lamb in broad pasture?"]

###### v17
Ephraim is joined to idols;
let him alone.

###### v18
When their drinking has ended,
they surely indulge in sexual orgies.
They love lewdness more than their ^[Hebrew "her"] glory.

###### v19
A wind has wrapped them ^[Hebrew "her"] in its wings,
and they will be ashamed because of their altars.
