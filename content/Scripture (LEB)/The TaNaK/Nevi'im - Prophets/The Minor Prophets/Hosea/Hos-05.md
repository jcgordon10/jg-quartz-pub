###### v1
Hear this, _O_ priests!
Give heed, _O_ house of Israel!
Listen, _O_ house of the king!
Because the judgment _applies_ to you;
because you have been a snare for Mizpah,
and a net spread out on Tabor;

###### v2
they dug a deep pit ^[Hebrew uncertain] _in_ Shittim,
but I _am_ a punishment for all of them.

###### v3
I myself know Ephraim,
and Israel is not hidden from me;
because now you have played the whore, _O_ Ephraim--
Israel is defiled.

###### v4
Their deeds do not permit them
to return them to God.
Because a spirit of whoredom _is_ in their midst,
they do not know Yahweh.

###### v5
The pride of Israel testifies _against him_, ^[Literally "against his face;" see 7:10]
and Israel and Ephraim stumble in their guilt,
and Judah stumbles with them.

###### v6
With their flocks ^[Hebrew "flock"] and herds ^[Hebrew "herd"] they will go
to seek Yahweh, but they will not find him;
he has withdrawn from them.

###### v7
They have dealt faithlessly with Yahweh
because they have borne illegitimate children.
Now _the_ new moon will devour them with their fields.

###### v8
Blow the _horn_ ^[Hebrew "shofar"] in Gibeah,
_the_ trumpet in Ramah.
Sound the alarm _in_ Beth-aven;
_look_ behind you, Benjamin.

###### v9
Ephraim will be a desolation
in the day of punishment;
among the tribes of Israel
I will reveal what is true.

###### v10
The princes of Judah have become
like those who remove a landmark;
on them I will pour out
my wrath like water.

###### v11
Ephraim is oppressed,
crushed _in_ judgment,
because he was determined
to go after filth. ^[Hebrew uncertain; another possible translation is "that he follows human commands"]

###### v12
But I _am_ like a maggot to Ephraim
and like rottenness to the house of Judah.

###### v13
And _when_ Ephraim saw his illness,
and Judah his wound,
Ephraim went to Assyria,
he sent to the great king. ^[Some translate literally "King Jareb" (see the NASB, NKJV)]
But he was unable to cure you
and heal your wound.

###### v14
Because I _will be_ like a lion to Ephraim
and like a fierce strong lion to the house of Judah.
I myself will tear and I will go;
I will carry off, and there is no one who delivers.

###### v15
_I will return again_ ^[Literally "I will go, I will return"] to my place
until they acknowledge _their_ guilt
and seek my face;
in their distress they will search ^[Or "they will beg favor of"] me.
