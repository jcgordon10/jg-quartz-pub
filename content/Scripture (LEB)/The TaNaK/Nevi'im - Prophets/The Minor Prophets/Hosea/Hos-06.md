###### v1
Come, let us return to Yahweh;
because _it is_ he who has torn, and he will heal us;
he has struck us down and will bind us up.

###### v2
    He will revive us after two days;
on the third day he will raise us up,
that we may live in his presence. ^[Or "before his face"]

###### v3
Let us know, let us press on to know Yahweh;
his rising _is_ sure like _the_ dawn.
He will come like the showers to us,
like _the_ spring rain that waters _the_ earth.

###### v4
What will I do with you, _O_ Ephraim?
What will I do with you, _O_ Judah?
Your love _is_ like a morning cloud,
like the dew that goes away early in the morning.

###### v5
Therefore, I have hewn _them_ by _the_ prophets;
I have killed them by the words of my mouth,
and my judgment ^[Hebrew "your judgments"] goes forth like the light.

###### v6
Because I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice,
and knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.

###### v7
But like Adam, they transgressed _the_ covenant;
there they dealt faithlessly with me.

###### v8
Gilead _is_ a city of evil,
a cunning _city_ because of blood. ^[The Hebrew is difficult; NRSV translates "tracked with blood"]

###### v9
Like bandits lying in wait,
_so is_ a band of priests;
they murder _on the_ road to Shechem;
indeed, they commit a monstrous crime.

###### v10
In the house of Israel I have seen something horrible;
Ephraim's unfaithfulness _is_ there.
Israel is defiled.

###### v11
For you also, _O_ Judah, a harvest is appointed,
when I restore the fortunes of my people,
