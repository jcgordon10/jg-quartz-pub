###### v1
when I would heal Israel,
and the corruption of Ephraim is revealed,
and the wicked deeds of Samaria;
because they deal _in_ falsehood,
_the_ thief breaks in, ^[Or "comes in"]
_and the_ bandit raids the outside.

###### v2
_But they did not consider_ ^[Literally "But they did not say to their heart"]
that I remember all their wickedness.
Now their deeds surround them;
they are before my face.

###### v3
By their wickedness they make _the_ king glad,
and _the_ officials by their treacheries.

###### v4
All of them commit adultery,
like a burning oven
whose baker has stopped from stirring the fire,
and from kneading _the_ dough until it is leavened.

###### v5
_On_ the day of our king, the princes
became sick _with_ the heat of wine; ^[This phrase refers to the effects of wine on the body]
he stretched out his hand with mockers.

###### v6
    Because they are kindled ^[Hebrew "they drew near;" other ancient translations read "they are kindled"] like an oven,
their heart burns within them;
all night their anger _smolders_, ^[Literally "sleeps"]
_in the_ morning it blazes like a flaming fire.

###### v7
All of them are hot as an oven,
and they devour ^[Or "they eat"] their rulers.
All their kings have fallen;
there is none who calls to me amongst them.

###### v8
Ephraim mixes himself
with the nations;
Ephraim is a bread cake
not turned over.

###### v9
Foreigners devour ^[Or "Foreigners eat"] his strength,
and he does not know _it_;
_mold_ ^[Literally "grey hair," but in this case the word refers to the "hairs of mold" on food] is also sprinkled upon him,
and he does not know _it_.

###### v10
The pride of Israel _testifies against him_ ^[Literally "answers against his face"]--
they do not return to Yahweh their God;
they do not seek him for all of this. ^[Or "in all of this"]

###### v11
Ephraim was like a dove,
silly, _without sense_; ^[Literally "without heart"]
they call _to_ Egypt,
they go _to_ Assyria.

###### v12
Just as they go, I will cast my net
over them;
I will bring them down
like the birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] of the heavens; ^[Or "sky"]
I will discipline them
according to a report to their assembly. ^[Hebrew uncertain]

###### v13
Woe to them, because they have strayed from me!
Destruction to them, because they have rebelled against me!
I myself would redeem them,
but they speak lies against me.

###### v14
They do not cry out to me from their heart,
but they wail on their beds;
because of grain and new wine they lacerate ^[Or "gash"] themselves;
they depart from me.

###### v15
And I myself trained
and strengthened their arms;
but they plan evil against me.

###### v16
They turn, not to the Most High, ^[Hebrew uncertain; the NRSV translates "to that which does not profit"; the NASB translates "but not upward"]
like a slack bow;
their officials will fall by the sword
because of the anger of their tongue.
This _is_ their scorn ^[The NRSV translates "So much for their babbling"]
in the land of Egypt.
