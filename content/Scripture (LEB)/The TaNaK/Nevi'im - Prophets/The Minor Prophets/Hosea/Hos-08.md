[[Hos-07|Previous Chapter]] | [[Hos-09|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
_Put_ to your lips _the_ trumpet
like a vulture over the house of Yahweh,
because they have _broken my covenant_ ^[Literally "transgressed my covenant"]
and rebelled against my law.

###### v2
They cry out to me,
"My God! We, Israel, know you!"

###### v3
Israel has spurned _the_ good;
_the_ enemy will pursue him.

###### v4
They appointed kings, but not through me;
they made officials, but without my knowledge.
_With_ their silver and gold
they made idols for themselves
for their ^[Hebrew "his"] own _destruction_. ^[Literally "cut off"]

###### v5
Your calf is rejected, ^[Hebrew "he rejects" or "has rejected you"] _O_ Samaria;
my anger burns against them.
How long ^[Hebrew "Until when"] will they be incapable of innocence?

###### v6
    Because _it is_ from Israel,
an artisan made it,
it _is_ not a god;
for the calf of Samaria
will be broken _to_ pieces.

###### v7
Because they sow the wind,
they will reap the whirlwind.
_The_ standing grain does not have heads; ^[Hebrew "head"]
it will not yield flour.
_And_ if it would yield,
strangers would devour it.

###### v8
Israel is swallowed up;
now they are among the nations,
like an object that no one desires.

###### v9
For they have gone up _to_ Assyria,
a wild donkey alone to itself;
Ephraim has sold itself _for_ lovers.

###### v10
Even though they have sold themselves to the nations,
now I will gather them.
They will soon writhe
from the burden of kings ^[Hebrew "king"] and princes.

###### v11
When Ephraim multiplied altars
to expiate sins,
they became to him altars to sin _on_.

###### v12
I write for him myriads of my instruction; ^[Or "my law"]
they are regarded as a strange thing.

###### v13
They offer sacrifices of my choice ^[Hebrew uncertain; or "loved ones"]
and they eat flesh;
Yahweh does not accept them.
Now he will remember their iniquity
and punish their sins;
they will return _to_ Egypt.

###### v14
    Israel has forgotten his maker and built palaces,
and Judah has multiplied fortified cities;
but I will send fire on his cities
and it will devour her strongholds.
