[[Hos-08|Previous Chapter]] | [[Hos-10|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Do not rejoice, _O_ Israel,
do not exult like the nations!
For you played the whore, departing from your God;
you loved a harlot's wage
on all the threshing floors of grain.

###### v2
    Threshing floor and wine vat will not feed them,
and new wine will fail her. ^[That is, Israel]

###### v3
    They will not remain
in the land of Yahweh.
But Ephraim will return _to_ Egypt,
and in Assyria they will eat unclean food.

###### v4
They will not pour _drink offerings of_ wine to Yahweh,
and their sacrifices will not please him.
_They are_ like mourners' bread for them;
all those who eat it will be defiled.
For their bread will be _for their hunger_; ^[Literally "for their soul"]
it will not come _to_ the house of Yahweh.

###### v5
What will you do on the day of _the_ appointed time,
and on the day of the festival of Yahweh?

###### v6
For look! _If_ they flee from the destruction,
Egypt will gather them;
Memphis ^[Hebrew "Noph"] will bury them.
Nettles will possess
their precious things of silver;
thorns _will be_ in their tents.

###### v7
The days of punishment have come;
the days of retribution have come;
Israel knows!
The prophet _is_ a fool,
the man of the spirit _is_ acting like a madman.
Because of the greatness of your sin,
_your_ hostility _is_ great.

###### v8
The prophet keeps watch _over_ Ephraim for my God;
the snare of a fowler _is_ on all his ways,
and hostility in the house of his God.

###### v9
_They deeply corrupted themselves_ ^[Literally "They made deep, they corrupted themselves"]
as _in_ the days of Gibeah;
he will remember their sin,
he will punish their sins.

###### v10
Like the grapes in the wilderness,
I found Israel.
Like early ripened fruit on the fig tree in the first season, ^[Or "in the beginning"]
I saw your ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]
They themselves came _to_ Baal Peor,
and they consecrated themselves to shame.
And they became detestable things,
like _the thing they love_. ^[Literally "like loving things"]

###### v11
Ephraim's glory _is_ like a bird;
it will fly away--
no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception.

###### v12
Even though they bring up their children,
I will bereave them before maturity. ^[Or "until no one is left"]
Woe to them indeed,
when I depart from them!

###### v13
Ephraim, as I see _it_,
_is_ like a palm in a meadow;
but Ephraim must bring out
his children to the slayer.

###### v14
Give them, _O_ Yahweh--
what will you give _them_?
Give them a miscarrying womb
and dry breasts.

###### v15
Every evil of theirs _began_ at Gilgal,
so I _began_ to hate them there;
because of the evil of their deeds
I will drive them out from my house.
I will love them no more;
all their officials _are_ rebels.

###### v16
Ephraim is stricken,
their root is dried up,
they shall not bear fruit.
Even if they give birth,
I will kill the cherished offspring of their womb.

###### v17
My God will reject them
because they did not listen to him,
and they will be wanderers among the nations.
