###### v1
Israel _is_ a luxuriant vine; ^[Or "ravaged vine"]
he yields fruit for himself.
The more his fruit increased,
_the more_ he made numerous altars.
The more his land prospered,
_the more_ he ^[Hebrew "they"] improved ^[Or "made beautiful"] _his_ stone pillars.

###### v2
Their heart is false;
now they must bear _their_ guilt.
He himself ^[That is, "Yahweh himself"] will break down their altars;
he will destroy their stone pillars.

###### v3
For now they will say,
"We have no king;
indeed, we did not fear Yahweh,
and what can a king do for us?"

###### v4
They utter words of vain oaths
_when_ _making covenants_, ^[Literally "cutting covenant"]
and judgment blossoms like a poisonous plant
on the furrows of the field.

###### v5
The inhabitants ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"] of Samaria tremble
for the calf ^[Hebrew "calves"] of Beth-aven.
Indeed, his people will mourn for it,
and his idolatrous priests will wail ^[Or "rejoice"] over it--
over its glory because it has departed from it.

###### v6
It will also be brought to Assyria,
_as_ tribute to _the_ great king. ^[See 5:13; some translate literally "King Jareb"]
Ephraim will obtain disgrace
and Israel will be ashamed from his advice. ^[Or "counsel"]

###### v7
Samaria will be destroyed;
her king _is_ like a chip on the surface of the water.

###### v8
The high places of Aven,
the sin of Israel, will be destroyed.
Thorn and thistle will grow
on their altars.
They will say to the mountains, "Cover us,"
and to the hills, "Fall on us."

###### v9
From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, _O_ Israel;
there _they have remained_. ^[Literally "they stood"]
Will not war in Gibeah overtake them
against the children of evil?

###### v10
    In my desire ^[The LXX translates "I will come"] I will punish them;
nations will be gathered against them
when they are punished for _their double iniquities_. ^[So _Qere_; Masoretic Hebrew text (_Kethib_) "their two eyes"]

###### v11
Ephraim _was_ a trained heifer,
that loved to thresh _grain_,
and I myself _spared_ ^[Literally "passed over"]
the fairness of her neck;
I will make Ephraim break the ground,
Judah will plow,
Jacob must till for himself.

###### v12
Sow for yourselves righteousness;
_reap loyal love_. ^[Literally "reap according to loyal love"]
Break up for yourself fallow ground;
_it is_ time to seek Yahweh
so he will come and rain
righteousness upon you.

###### v13
You have plowed wickedness,
you have reaped injustice,
you have eaten the fruit of lies, ^[Hebrew "lie"]
because you have trusted in your strength,
in the multitude of your warriors.

###### v14
The tumult of war will rise up against your people,
and all your fortresses will be destroyed,
as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel;
on the day of war
mothers were dashed to pieces with _their_ children. ^[Or "upon _their_ children"]

###### v15
So it will be done to you, _O_ Bethel,
because of the evil of your wickedness;
at dawn, the king of Israel
will be utterly destroyed.
