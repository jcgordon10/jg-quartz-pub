[[Hos-10|Previous Chapter]] | [[Hos-12|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
When Israel was a child, I loved him,
and out of Egypt I called my son.

###### v2
When I called ^[Hebrew "When they called"; the LXX and modern translations read "When I called"] them, they went from my face. ^[Hebrew "their face"]
They sacrificed to the Baals, and they sacrificed to idols.

###### v3
And I myself taught Ephraim to walk;
I took them ^[Hebrew uncertain] in my ^[Hebrew "his"] arms,
but they did not know that I healed them.

###### v4
I drew them _with human ties_, ^[Literally "ropes of a human"]
with the bands of love.
I was to them like one who lifted up ^[Or "like one who imposed"] a yoke on their jaws, ^[Or "infants to their cheeks"]
_though_ I bent down to them ^[Hebrew "him"] _and_ let them ^[Hebrew "him"] eat.

###### v5
He will return ^[Or "They will not return"] to the land of Egypt,
and Assyria will be his king, ^[That is "Israel's king"]
because they refused to return.

###### v6
_The_ sword rages in his cities;
it consumes his false prophets
and devours because of their plans.

###### v7
    My people are bent on backsliding from me.
To the Most High they call,
he does not raise them at all.

###### v8
How can I give you up, _O_ Ephraim?
_How_ can I hand you over, _O_ Israel?
How can I make you like Admah?
_How_ can I treat you like Zeboiim?
My heart is disturbed ^[Or "My heart is overturned"] within me;
_all_ ^[Literally "together"] my compassions are aroused.

###### v9
_I will not execute_ ^[Literally "I will not do"] _my fierce anger_, ^[Literally "the anger of my nose"]
I will not again destroy Ephraim;
because I _am_ God
and not a mortal, ^[Or "human"]
_the_ Holy _One_ in your midst;
and I will not come in wrath.

###### v10
    They will go after Yahweh;
he roars like a lion.
When he roars,
his children will come trembling
from _the_ sea. ^[That is, "_the_ West"]

###### v11
They will tremble like birds ^[Hebrew "bird"] from Egypt,
and like doves ^[Hebrew "dove"] from the land of Assyria;
and I will let them return ^[Hebrew "I will cause them to live"] to their homes--
a declaration of Yahweh.

###### v12
 ^[[[Hos-11#v12|Hosea 11:12–12:14]] in the English Bible is 12:1–15 in the Hebrew Bible] Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, ^[Hebrew "lie"]
and the house of Israel with deceit;
and Judah is still wandering with God
and _is_ faithful to the Holy One.
