[[Hos-12|Previous Chapter]] | [[Hos-14|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
When Ephraim spoke, ^[Hebrew "speaks"] _there was_ terror;
he was exalted in Israel,
but he incurred guilt through Baal and died.

###### v2
And now they sin again,
and they make for themselves a molten idol,
idols from their silver metal according to their understanding,
all of them the work of skilled craftsmen.
To these they say, "Sacrifice!"
People are kissing bull calves.

###### v3
Therefore, they will be like the morning cloud,
and like _the_ dew of early morning going _away_,
like chaff swirling from _the_ threshing floor,
or like smoke from a window.

###### v4
I _am_ Yahweh your God
since ^[Or "from"] the land of Egypt;
you know no god except me,
and no one saves besides me.

###### v5
I fed you ^[So LXX; Hebrew "I knew you"] in the desert,
in the land of drought.

###### v6
When I fed them, ^[Hebrew "According to their pasture"] they were satisfied;
they were satisfied and their heart was lifted up;
therefore they forgot me.

###### v7
And I will be like a lion to them;
I lie in wait beside _the_ way, like a leopard.

###### v8
I will attack them like a bear robbed of her offspring,
and I will tear open the covering of their heart;
there I will devour them like a lion,
like an animal of the field would mutilate them.

###### v9
I will destroy you, ^[Hebrew "He destroys you"] _O_ Israel;
who will help you? ^[Hebrew "for in me, in your help"]

###### v10
Where now _is_ your king that he may save you?
_Where_ in all your cities _are_ your judges,
of whom you said, "Give to
me a king and rulers?"

###### v11
I gave you a king in my anger,
and I took _him_ in my wrath.

###### v12
The sin of Ephraim _is_ wrapped up;
his sin _is_ concealed.

###### v13
The labor pains of childbirth come for him;
he _is_ an unwise son
because _at the_ proper time, he does not present himself
_at the mouth of the womb_. ^[Literally "the place where the sons burst forth"]

###### v14
Should I redeem them from _the power_ ^[Literally "the hand"] of Sheol?  ^["Sheol" is a Hebrew term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the underworld]
Should I deliver them from death?
Where _are_ your plagues, _O_ Death?
Where _is_ your destruction, _O_ Sheol? ^["Sheol" is a Hebrew term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the underworld]
Compassion is hidden from my eyes.

###### v15
    Although he may flourish among reeds, ^[Hebrew "brothers"]
_the_ east wind will come, a wind of Yahweh
rising from _the_ desert;
his fountain will dry up,
his spring will be parched.
It will plunder his treasury, ^[Or "its treasury"]
every object of desire.

###### v16
 ^[[[Hos-13#v16|Hosea 13:16–14:9]] in the English Bible is 14:1–10 in the Hebrew Bible] Samaria will be guilty,
because she has rebelled against her God;
they will fall by _the_ sword,
their children will be dashed to pieces,
and their pregnant women will be ripped open.
