[[Hos-13|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Return to Yahweh your God, _O_ Israel,
for you have stumbled because of your sin.

###### v2
Take words with you,
and return to Yahweh.
Say to him,
"Take away all guilt;
accept good, and we will offer
the fruit ^[Hebrew uncertain] of our lips.

###### v3
Assyria will not save us;
we will not ride on horses, ^[Hebrew "horse"]
and we will say no more, "Our God,"
to the work of our hands
because in you _the_ fatherless child finds mercy.

###### v4
I will heal their disloyalty; ^[Or "backsliding"]
I will love them freely
because my anger has turned back
from them. ^[Hebrew "him"]

###### v5
I will be like the dew to Israel;
he will blossom like the lily plant,
and he will strike his roots like the _trees of_ Lebanon.

###### v6
    His new plant shoots will spread out;
his splendor will be like the olive tree,
and his scent like the _trees of_ Lebanon.

###### v7
_They will again dwell_ ^[Literally "They shall return, they shall dwell"] in my ^[Hebrew "his"] shadow;
they will grow grain
and they will blossom like the plant vine;
his fame _will be_ like the wine of Lebanon.

###### v8
_O_ Ephraim, _what have I to do_ ^[Literally "what for me"] with idols?
I myself have answered and looked after you. ^[Hebrew "him"]
I am like a luxuriant cypress;
your fruit ^[Or "your faithfulness"] comes from me.

###### v9
Who _is_ wise that he can understand these _things_?
Who is discerning that he knows them?
The ways of Yahweh _are_ right,
and _the_ righteous walk in them;
but transgressors stumble in them.
