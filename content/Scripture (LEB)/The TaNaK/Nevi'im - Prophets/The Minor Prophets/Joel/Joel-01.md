[[Joel-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
The word of Yahweh that came to Joel son of Pethuel.

###### v2
Hear this, O elders,
and give ear, all the inhabitants of the land.
Has this happened in your days?
Or the days of your ancestors?

###### v3
Tell it to your children,
and your children to their children,
and their children to the following generation.

###### v4
What the cutting locust left,
the swarming locust has eaten.
What the swarming locust left,
the hopping locust has eaten.
And what the hopping locust left,
the destroying locust has eaten.

###### v5
Wake up, drunkards, and weep!
Wail, all drinkers of wine, over the new wine,
for it is cut off from your mouth.

###### v6
Because a nation has _invaded_ ^[Literally "come up against"] my land,
strong _and beyond counting_. ^[Literally "without number"]
Its teeth _are_ the teeth of a lion,
and its fangs _are those_ of a lioness.

###### v7
It has made my vine a desolation,
and my fig tree a completely splintered stump.
It has stripped them bare and thrown _them_ down;
their branches have turned white.

###### v8
Lament like a virgin girded in sackcloth
for the husband of her youth.

###### v9
The offering and libation are withheld
from the house ^[Or "temple"] of Yahweh.
The priests mourn,
the ministers of Yahweh.

###### v10
The field is destroyed;
the earth mourns
because _the_ grain is destroyed,
_the_ new wine dries up,
_the_ olive oil languishes.

###### v11
Be ashamed, farmers;
Wail, vinedressers,
over _the_ wheat and over _the_ barley,
because _the_ harvest of the field is ruined.

###### v12
The vine withers
and the fig tree droops.
The pomegranate tree, and also the palm tree, the apple tree
--all the trees of the field--are dried up.
Indeed, joy is dried up
among the sons of men.

###### v13
Gird yourselves and lament, O priests!
Wail, _O_ ministers of _the_ altar!
Come spend the night in sackcloth,
_O_ ministers of my God,
because offering and libation
are withheld from the house of your God.

###### v14
Solemnize a fast!
Call an assembly!
Gather _the_ elders,
all _of_ the inhabitants of the land
_in_ the house of Yahweh your God,
and cry out to Yahweh.

###### v15
Ah! For the day!
For the day of Yahweh is near.
It will come like destruction from Shaddai. ^[Often translated "the Almighty"]

###### v16
_Is_ not food cut _off_
before our eyes,
from the house of our God,
joy and gladness?

###### v17
The seeds shrivel under their clods;
the storehouses are desolate.
The grain storage places are destroyed
because grain has dried out.

###### v18
How _the_ beasts ^[Hebrew "beast"] groan;
the herds of cattle wander around
because there is no pasture for them;
_the_ flocks of sheep are in distress.

###### v19
To you, _O_ Yahweh, I cry out,
because fire has devoured
the pastures of the desert,
and flames ^[Hebrew "flame"] burned
all the trees of the field.

###### v20
Also, the beasts of _the_ field
long for you,
because the courses of water
are dried up,
and fire has devoured
the pastures of the desert.
