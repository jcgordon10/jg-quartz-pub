[[Joel-01|Previous Chapter]] | [[Joel-03|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Blow _the_ trumpet ^[Hebrew "shofar"] in Zion,
and sound the alarm on _my holy mountain_! ^[Literally "mountain of my holiness"]
Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
for the day of Yahweh _is_ coming
--_it is_ indeed near.

###### v2
A day of darkness and gloom,
a day of cloud and thick darkness,
like the dawn spreads on the mountains,
a great and strong army!
There has been nothing like it from old,
and after it nothing will be again _for generations to come_. ^[Literally "until years of generations"]

###### v3
_Before them_ ^[Literally "before the presence of it"] a fire devours,
and behind them a flame burns.
Like the garden of Eden is the land _before them_, ^[Literally "before the presence of it"]
and after them _it is like_ a desolate desert,
and nothing can escape them.

###### v4
Like _the_ appearance of horses is their appearance,
and like horsemen they run;

###### v5
like _the_ sound of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap about;
like _the_ sound of a flame of fire
devouring stubble;
like a strong army arranged
in rows _for_ battle.

###### v6
_From before them_ ^[Or "From in front of it," or "From the presence of it"] nations writhe,
all faces _turn pale_. ^[Literally "gather paleness"]

###### v7
They run like mighty warriors, ^[That is, the "great and strong army" (see 2:2)]
they scale the wall like men of war;
each goes on its own way,
and they do not swerve _from_ their paths.

###### v8
They do not jostle _one another_; ^[Literally "each man his brother"]
each goes on its own trail;
and through the falling weapons, ^[Hebrew "weapon"]
they are not halted.

###### v9
In the city they rush forth;
on the walls ^[Hebrew "wall"] they run.
Into the houses they climb up;
through the windows
they enter like _a_ thief.

###### v10
_Before them_ ^[Literally "Before the presence of it"] _the_ earth quakes;
_the_ heavens tremble;
_the_ sun and _the_ moon grow dark,
and _the_ stars _have withheld_ ^[Literally "gathered"] their splendor

###### v11
And Yahweh _utters_ ^[Literally "gives"] his voice before his army,
because his encampment _is_ very large;
strong _is the_ one who carries out his decree,
for great _is_ the day of Yahweh
and exceedingly fearful.
Who can endure it?

###### v12
"And even now," _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh,
"return to me with all your heart,
with fasting, and weeping, and wailing."

###### v13
    Rend your hearts ^[Hebrew "heart"] and not your garments,
and return to Yahweh your God,
because he _is_ gracious and compassionate,
_slow to anger_ ^[Or "patient"; literally "long of anger"] and great in loyal love,
and relenting from harm.

###### v14
Who knows _whether_ he will turn and relent,
and leave a blessing behind him,
an offering and a libation,
for Yahweh your God?

###### v15
Blow _the_ trumpet ^[Hebrew "Shofar"] in Zion,
sanctify a fast, call an assembly;

###### v16
gather _the_ people, consecrate _the_ assembly;
assemble _the_ elders, gather _the_ children,
even those _who are_ breast-feeding;
let _the_ bridegroom come out from his private room,
and _the_ bride from her canopy.

###### v17
Between the colonnade and the altar,
let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep.
And let them say, "Take pity, Yahweh, on your people.
Do not make your inheritance a reproach,
a byword among _the_ nations.
Why should they say among the nations,
'Where _is_ their God?'"

###### v18
Then Yahweh became jealous for his land
and took pity on his people.

###### v19
And Yahweh answered and said to his people,
"Look at me, _I am_ sending to you
grain, new wine, and olive oil,
and you will be satisfied by it.
I will not give you _over_ any more
as a disgrace among the nations.

###### v20
_The northerners_ ^[Or "The northern army"]
I will remove from you;
I will drive them to a desert
and desolate land,
its ^[That is, the northern army] front to the eastern sea,
and its rear into the western sea;
its stench and odor will rise up
because he ^[That is, Yahweh (see v. [[Joel-02#v21|21]])] has done great things.

###### v21
Do not fear, _O_ land,
rejoice and be glad,
because Yahweh has done great things.

###### v22
Do not fear, wild animals of _the_ field,
because _the_ pastures of _the_ desert have put forth new green shoots,
because _the_ tree has produced its fruit,
_the_ fig tree and _the_ vine
have yielded their produce.

###### v23
Be glad, _O_ children of Zion,
be glad and rejoice in Yahweh your God,
because he has given for you
the autumn rains for _your_ righteousness, ^[Or "vindication"]
and he has _poured down_ ^[Literally "brought down"] for you rainwater,
_the_ autumn and spring rains, as before.

###### v24
The threshing floors will be full _with_ grain,
and the vats will overflow
_with_ new wine and olive oil.

###### v25
I will repay you the years
that the locust has eaten,
the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter,
my mighty troops that I sent against you.

###### v26
And you will eat abundantly and be satisfied,
and praise the name of Yahweh your God,
who has dealt with you _wondrously_. ^[Literally "to do a wonder"]
My people _will never be ashamed_. ^[Literally "will forever not be ashamed"]

###### v27
And you will know that I _am_ in the midst of Israel,
and I _am_ Yahweh,
your God, and there is no _other_.
My people _will never be ashamed again_. ^[Literally "will forever no longer be ashamed"]

###### v28
 ^[[[Joel-02#v28|Joel 2:28–32]][[Joel-02#v29|]][[Joel-02#v30|]][[Joel-02#v31|]][[Joel-02#v32|]] in the English Bible is 3:1–5 in the Hebrew Bible] And it will happen afterward thus:
I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh,
and your sons and your daughters will prophesy,
and your elders will dream dreams;
your young men shall see visions.

###### v29
And also on the male slaves and on the female slaves,
I will pour out my Spirit in those days.

###### v30
And I will _set_ ^[Literally "give"] wonders in the heavens, and on earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke.

###### v31
The sun will be changed to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the coming of the great and awesome day of Yahweh.

###### v32
And it will happen--everyone who calls on the name of Yahweh will be rescued, because on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be _those who escape_, ^[Literally, "an escape"] as Yahweh said, and among the survivors whom Yahweh is calling.
