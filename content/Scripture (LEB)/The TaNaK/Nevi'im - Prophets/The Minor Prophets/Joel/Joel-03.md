###### v1
 ^[[[Joel-03|Joel 3:1–21]] in the English Bible is 4:1–21 in the Hebrew Bible] For look! In those days, and in that time, when I will return ^[Or "restore"] the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,

###### v2
I will gather all the nations, and I will bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat, and I will argue _a case against them_ ^[Literally "a matter with them"] there concerning my people and my inheritance Israel whom they have scattered among the nations, and my land _that_ they have divided.

###### v3
For my people they cast lots, ^[Hebrew "lot"] and _they traded_ ^[Literally "gave"] the male child for the prostitute, and the female child they sold for wine and they drank _it_.

###### v4
What _are_ you to me, _O_ Tyre and _O_ Sidon, and all of the regions of Philistia? Are you repaying to me what is deserved? If you _are_ recompensing me, I will return swiftly _and_ quickly what you deserve on your head!

###### v5
For you have taken my silver and my gold, and my beautiful treasures you have carried into your temples.

###### v6
And the sons of Judah and Jerusalem you sold to the sons of the Greeks, in order to remove them from their border.

###### v7
Look! I _am_ rousing them from the place where you have sold them, and I will return what you deserve on your head!

###### v8
I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they will sell them to _the_ Sabeans and to a nation far _away_, for Yahweh has spoken.

###### v9
Proclaim this among the nations:
_Prepare for war_! ^[Literally "Sanctify a battle"]
Stir up the mighty warriors;
let them approach and come up;
_let_ all the men of war approach.

###### v10
Beat your cutting tools of iron into swords
and your pruning hooks into spears;
let the weakling say, 'I am a mighty warrior!'

###### v11
Hurry and come,
all the nations, from all around,
and gather _yourselves_ there.
Bring down your mighty warriors, O Yahweh!

###### v12
Let the nations be roused and let them come up
to the valley of Jehoshaphat,
for there I will sit to judge
all the nations from all around.

###### v13
Send forth _the_ sickle,
for the harvest is ripe!
Go tread,
for _the_ winepress is full!
The vats overflow,
because their evil _is_ great!

###### v14
Commotion, commotion
in the valley of decision!
For the day of Yahweh _is_ near
in the valley of decision!

###### v15
_The_ sun and _the_ moon grow dark,
and _the_ stars _have withheld_ ^[Literally "gathered"] their splendor.

###### v16
And Yahweh roars from Zion;
from Jerusalem he utters his voice,
and _the_ heavens and _the_ earth shake.
But Yahweh _is_ a refuge for his people,
and a protection for the children of Israel.

###### v17
And you will know that I, Yahweh your God,
_am_ dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.
And Jerusalem will be _a place of_ holiness,
and strangers will pass through _it_ no longer.

###### v18
And it will happen on that day;
the mountains will drip new wine,
and the hills will flow with milk,
and all the channels of Judah will flow with water.
A spring from the house of Yahweh will come forth,
and it will water the valley of Acacia Trees. ^[Or "the wadi Shittim"]

###### v19
Egypt will become a desolation,
and Edom will become a _desolate desert_, ^[Literally "desert of desolation"]
because of the violence _they did_ against the children of Judah,
in whose land they have shed innocent blood.

###### v20
But Judah will be inhabited forever,
and Jerusalem _for all generations_. ^[Or "for each generation"]

###### v21
_I will cleanse their bloodguilt_ ^[Literally "I will not leave unpunished their blood"] _that_ _I did not cleanse_, ^[Or "I did not consider innocent"]
for Yahweh is dwelling in Zion.
