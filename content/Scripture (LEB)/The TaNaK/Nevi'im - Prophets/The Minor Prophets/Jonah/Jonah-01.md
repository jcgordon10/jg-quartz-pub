[[Jonah-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
And the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,

###### v2
"Get up! Go to the great city Nineveh and cry out against her, because their evil has come up _before me_." ^[Literally "to my face"]

###### v3
But Jonah set out to flee toward Tarshish from _the presence of_ ^[Literally "from to face of"] Yahweh. And he went down _to_ Joppa and found a merchant ship going _to_ Tarshish, and paid her fare, and went on board her to go with them toward Tarshish from _the presence of_ ^[Literally "from to face of"] Yahweh.

###### v4
And Yahweh hurled a great wind upon the sea, and it was a great storm on the sea, and the merchant ship _was in danger of breaking up_. ^[Literally "threatened to be broken up"]

###### v5
And the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they threw the _contents_ ^[Literally "objects"] that were in the merchant ship into the sea to lighten it for them. And _meanwhile_ Jonah went down into the hold of the vessel and lay down and fell asleep.

###### v6
And the captain ^[Or "commander"] of the ship approached him and said to him, "Why are you _sound asleep_? ^[Literally "in a deep sleep"] Get up! Call on your god! Perhaps _your_ god ^[Literally "the god," with the article indicating previous reference] will take notice of us and we won't perish!"

###### v7
And they said _to one another_, ^[Literally "each to his friend/companion"] "Come, let us cast lots so that we may know on whose account this disaster _has come_ on us!" And they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.

###### v8
So they said to him, "Please tell us whoever _is responsible that_ this disaster _has come_ upon us! What _is_ your occupation? And from where do you come? What _is_ your country? And from which people _are_ you?"

###### v9
And he said to them, "I _am_ a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."

###### v10
Then the men _were greatly afraid_, ^[Literally "were afraid with a great fear"] and they said to him, "What _is_ this you have done?" because they ^[Literally "the men" but this is redundant in English] knew that he _was_ fleeing _from the presence of_ ^[Literally "from before the face of"] Yahweh (because he had told them).

###### v11
So they said to him, "What shall we do to you so that the sea may quiet down for us?" because the sea _was growing more and more tempestuous_. ^[Literally "going/growing and storming"]

###### v12
And he said to them, "Pick me up and hurl me into the sea so that the sea may quiet down for you, because I know that on account of me this great storm _has come_ upon you all."

###### v13
But the men rowed _hard_ to bring _the ship_ ^[Here the direct object is supplied from context] back to the dry land, and they could not _do so_ because the sea _was growing more and more tempestuous_ ^[Literally "going/growing and storming"] against them.

###### v14
So they cried out to Yahweh, and they said, "O Yahweh! Please do not let us perish because of this man's life, and _do not make us guilty of innocent blood_, ^[Literally "do not give innocent blood on us"] because you, O Yahweh, did what you wanted."

###### v15
And they picked Jonah up and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging.

###### v16
So the men feared Yahweh _greatly_, ^[Literally "with a great fear"] and they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh and _made_ ^[Literally "vowed"] vows.

###### v17
 ^[[[Jonah-01#v17|Jonah 1:17–2:10]] in the English Bible is 2:1–11 in the Hebrew Bible] And Yahweh provided a large fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
