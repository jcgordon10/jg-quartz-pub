###### v1
And Jonah prayed to Yahweh his God from the belly of the fish

###### v2
and said,
"I called _from my distress_ ^[Literally "from distress for me"] to Yahweh,
and he answered me;
from the belly of Sheol ^["Sheol" is a Hebrew term for the place where the dead reside (i.e. the Underworld)] I cried for help--
you heard my voice.

###### v3
And you threw me _into the_ deep,
into the heart of _the_ seas,
and _the_ sea currents surrounded me;
all your breakers and your surging waves
passed over me.

###### v4
And I said, 'I am banished ^[Or "expelled," or "driven away"]
from your sight;
how ^[Or "however, I will continue to look on your holy temple"] _will I continue to look_ ^[Literally "will I do again to look," meaning "will I continue to look"]
_on your holy temple_?' ^[Literally "on the temple of your holiness"]

###### v5
_The_ waters encompassed me up to _my_ neck;
_the_ deep surrounded me;
seaweed was wrapped around my head.

###### v6
I went down to the foundations of _the_ mountains;
the Underworld--its bars _were_ around me forever.
But you brought up my life from _the_ pit,
Yahweh my God.

###### v7
When my life was ebbing away from me,
I remembered Yahweh,
and my prayer came to you,
_to your holy temple_. ^[Literally "to the temple of your holiness"]

###### v8
Those who worship vain idols
forsake their loyal love. ^[This could mean (1) they forsake the loyal love they should show to God or (2) they forfeit _forsake_ the loyal love that God would have shown to them]

###### v9
But I, with a voice of thanksgiving,
will sacrifice to you;
I will fulfill what I have vowed.
Deliverance ^[Or "salvation"] _belongs_ to Yahweh!"

###### v10
And Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out on the dry land.
