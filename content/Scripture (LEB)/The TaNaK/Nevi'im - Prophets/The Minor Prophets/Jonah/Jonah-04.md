[[Jonah-03|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
And this ^[Hebrew "it"] _was greatly displeasing_ ^[Literally "was displeasing _with_ great displeasure"] to Jonah, and _he became furious_. ^[Literally "it was hot for him"]

###### v2
And he prayed to Yahweh and said, "O Yahweh, _was_ this not _what I said_ ^[Literally "my word"] while I was in my homeland? Therefore _I originally fled_ ^[Literally "I did the first time to flee"] to Tarshish, because I knew that you _are_ a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger _and having great steadfast love_, ^[Literally "and great of steadfast love"] and one who relents concerning calamity. ^[That is, calamity sent by God as judgment]

###### v3
And so then, Yahweh, please take my life from me, because _for_ me death _is_ better than life!"

###### v4
And Yahweh said, "_Is it right for you to be angry_?" ^[Literally "Rightfully is it hot for you"; some take this to mean "Are you so very angry?" (_Targum_ [[Jonah-04#v4|Jonah 4:4;]] see also JPS, NEB, NET)]

###### v5
And Jonah went out from the city and sat _down_ east of the city, and he made for himself a shelter there. And he sat under it in the shade, _waiting to see_ ^[Literally "until he would see"] what would happen with the city.

###### v6
And Yahweh God appointed a plant, ^[Probably a castor oil plant, though some have suggested some type of gourd plant] and he made it grow up over Jonah to be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. And Jonah _was very glad_ ^[Literally "was glad with great joy"] about the plant.

###### v7
So God appointed a worm _at daybreak_ ^[Literally "at the coming up of the dawn"] the next day, and it attacked the plant, and it withered.

###### v8
_And when the sun rose_, ^[Literally "and it happened at the rising of the sun"] God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head and he grew faint. _And he asked that he could die_ ^[Literally "and he asked his soul to die"] and said, "My death _is_ better than my life!"

###### v9
So God said to Jonah, "_Is it right for you to be angry_ ^[Literally "rightfully is it hot for you"; some take this to mean "Are you so very angry?" (_Targum_ [[Jonah-04#v4|Jonah 4:4;]] see also JPS, NEB, NET)] about the plant?" And he said, "_It is right for me to be angry enough to die_!" ^[Literally "Rightfully it is hot for me until death"]

###### v10
But Yahweh said, "You are troubled about the plant, for which you did not labor nor cause it to grow. _It grew up in a night and it perished in a night_! ^[Literally "Which was a son of a night and _as_ a son of a night it perished"]

###### v11
And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, the great city, _in which there are_ ^[Literally "which there are in it"] more _than one hundred and twenty thousand_ ^[Literally "than two ten myriad" (12 x 10,000)] people who do not know right from left, ^["_hand_" is often supplied, but it is not clear just what deficiency is meant by this expression, which occurs only here in biblical Hebrew] plus many animals?"
