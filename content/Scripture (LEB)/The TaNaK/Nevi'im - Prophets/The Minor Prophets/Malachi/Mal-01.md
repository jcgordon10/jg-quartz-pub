[[Mal-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
_An oracle_. ^[Literally "A burden"] The word of Yahweh to Israel _through_ ^[Literally "by the hand of"] Malachi. ^[The name "Malachi" means "my messenger" in Hebrew]

###### v2
"I have loved you," says Yahweh, but you say, "How have you loved us?" "_Is_ Esau not Jacob's brother?" _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh. "I have loved Jacob,

###### v3
but Esau I have hated. I have made his ^[That is, "Esau's"] mountain ranges a desolation, and _given_ his inheritance to the jackals of _the_ desert."

###### v4
If Edom says, "We are shattered, but we will return and rebuild _the_ ruins," Yahweh of hosts says this: "They may build, but I will tear down; and they will be called a territory of wickedness, and the people _with_ whom Yahweh is angry forever."

###### v5
Your eyes will see _this_, and you will say, "Yahweh is great beyond the borders ^[Hebrew "boundary"] of Israel."

###### v6
"A son honors _his_ father, and a slave his master; ^[Hebrew "masters"] but if I _am_ a father, where _is_ my honor, and if I _am_ a master, ^[Hebrew "masters"] where _is_ my reverence?" says Yahweh of hosts to you, O priests, _who despise_ ^[Literally "despisers of"] my name. "But you say, 'How have we despised your name?'

###### v7
_You are_ presenting defiled food on my altar! But you ask, 'How have we defiled you?' By saying _that_ the table of Yahweh is despised!

###### v8
When you offer a blind _animal_ for sacrifice, is that not wrong? ^[Or "is there no wrong?"] And when you offer _the_ lame and the one who is ill, is that not wrong? ^[Or "is there no wrong?"] Present it, please, to your governor! Will he be pleased with you? _Will he show you favor_?" ^[Literally "Will he lift your face?"] says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v9
So then, _implore the favor of God_ ^[Literally "appease, please, the face of God"] so that he will be gracious to us. "_This is what you have done_. ^[Literally "From your hand was this"] _Will he show favor to any of you_?" ^[Literally "will he lift up from you a face"] says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v10
"Who also among you will shut _the temple_ doors _so that_ you will not kindle fire in vain _on_ my altar? I take no pleasure in you," says Yahweh of hosts, "and _I will not accept_ ^[Literally "I will not take pleasure in"] an offering from your hand.

###### v11
From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name _is_ great among the nations, and in every place incense _is_ being presented to my name, and a pure offering. For my name _is_ great among the nations," says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v12
"But you _are_ profaning it by saying the table of the Lord _is_ defiled, and its fruit--its food ^[The Hebrew here is difficult; "its food" may function to explain "its fruit"]--is despised!

###### v13
And you say, 'Look! _This is_ a weariness,' and you sniff _with disdain_ at it," says Yahweh of hosts. "And you bring _the_ stolen, the lame, and the one that is sick--_this_ you bring as the offering! Should I _accept it_ ^[Literally "take pleasure in it"] from your hand?" says Yahweh.

###### v14
"Cursed is the one who cheats, who has in his flock a male and vows _it_, but _instead_ sacrifices a blemished one to the Lord! For I _am_ a great king," says Yahweh of hosts, "and my name _is_ awesome among the nations."
