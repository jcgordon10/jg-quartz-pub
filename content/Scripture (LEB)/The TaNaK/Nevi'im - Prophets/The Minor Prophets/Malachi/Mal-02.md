###### v1
"And so then, O priests, this command _is_ for you:

###### v2
If you will not listen, and if you will not _take it to heart_ ^[Literally, "place _it_ on _your_ heart"] to give glory to my name," says Yahweh of hosts, "then I will send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings; moreover I have _already_ cursed them because _you are not taking it to heart_. ^[Literally "you _are_ not placing _it_ on _your_ heart"]

###### v3
Look! I _am_ going to rebuke _your offspring_, ^[Literally "for you the offspring"] and I will scatter offal on your faces, _the_ offal of your religious feasts, and you will be carried to it. ^[The Hebrew is difficult. The subject is indefinite, and "it" likely refers to a refuse or waste pile]

###### v4
"Then you will know that I have sent to you this command, that my covenant with Levi _continues_," ^[Literally "be"] says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v5
"My covenant with him was _one of_ life and peace, and I gave them to him. _This required_ reverence, and he revered ^[Or "feared"] me and stood in awe _before_ ^[Literally "from the face of"] my name.

###### v6
_The_ instruction of truth ^[Or "law of truth"] was in his mouth, and wickedness was not found on his lips. In peace and in uprightness ^[Or "rectitude," or "fairness"] he walked with me, and he brought back many from sin. ^[Or "iniquity"]

###### v7
For the lips of _the_ priest should guard knowledge, and they should seek instruction ^[Or "law"] from his mouth, for he _is_ the messenger of Yahweh of hosts.

###### v8
But you, you have turned from the way; you have caused many to stumble by _your_ instruction; ^[Or "_the_ law"] you have ruined the covenant of Levi," says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v9
"And in turn I have made you despised and humbled before all the people, inasmuch as you _are_ not keeping ^[Or "observing"] my way, but are _favoring your own instruction_." ^[Literally "lifting faces in the instruction/law"]

###### v10
_Do we not all have_ ^[Literally "_Is_ for all of us not"] one father? Has not one God created us? Why _then_ are we unfaithful _to one another_, ^[Literally "each man to his brother"] profaning the covenant of our ancestors? ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v11
Judah has been faithless, and a detestable thing has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem. Judah has profaned the sanctuary of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign ^[Or "pagan"] god.

###### v12
May Yahweh cut off from the tents of Jacob the man who does this, _the_ one who is awake and _who_ answers, and _the one who_ brings an offering to Yahweh of hosts!

###### v13
And this you do _as well_: ^[Literally "a second time"] _you_ cover the altar of Yahweh _with_ tears, _with_ weeping and _with_ groaning, because he ^[Yahweh] _no longer regards the offering_ ^[Literally "there is no longer turning to the offering"] or accepts _it_ _with_ favor from your hand.

###### v14
But you ask, "_For what reason_?" ^[Literally "Because of what?"] Because Yahweh stands as a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have been unfaithful, even though she _is_ your marriage partner and _your wife by covenant_. ^[Literally "the wife of your covenant"]

###### v15
_Did not one God make them?_ ^[Literally "Not one did he make"] But a remnant of _the_ spirit is his. ^[The meaning of this sentence is difficult; literally "And a remnant of the spirit to him"] And what does the one _God_ desire? An offspring of God. ^[Or "a godly offspring"] _You must be attentive to_ ^[Literally "You must keep watch on"] your spirit, and you must not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth.

###### v16
"For _I_ hate divorce," ^[Hebrew "sending away"] says Yahweh, the God of Israel, "and he _who_ covers his clothing _with_ violence," says Yahweh of hosts. "_You must be attentive to_ ^[Literally "You must keep watch on"] your spirit and you must not be unfaithful."

###### v17
You have wearied Yahweh with your words, but you ask, "With what have we wearied _him_?" _You have done so_ _when you say_, ^[Literally "at your saying"] "Everyone who does evil _is_ good in the _sight_ ^[Literally "eyes"] of Yahweh, and in them he delights," or "Where _is_ the God of justice?"
