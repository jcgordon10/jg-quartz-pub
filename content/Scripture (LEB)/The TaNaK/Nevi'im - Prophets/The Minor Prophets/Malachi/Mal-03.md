###### v1
"Look! I _am_ going to send my messenger, ^[Or "my angel"] and he will prepare ^[Or "clear"] _the_ way _before me_. ^[Literally "before my face"] And the Lord whom you _are_ seeking will come suddenly to his temple, and the messenger of the covenant, _in_ whom you _are_ taking pleasure--look!--_he is_ about to come," says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v2
And who _can_ endure the day of his coming? And who _is_ the one who can stand _when he appears_? ^[Literally "at his appearing"] For he _is_ like a refiner's fire, like launderers' alkali. ^[Or "lye," or "soap"]

###### v3
He will sit _as_ a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the children of Levi, and he will refine them like gold and like silver, and they will present to Yahweh offerings ^[Hebrew "offering"] in righteousness.

###### v4
And the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to Yahweh, like _in the_ days of old and like _in_ former years.

###### v5
"Then I will approach you for judgment, and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers, and against those who swear _falsely_, ^[Literally "as far as the falseness"] and against the oppressors of _the_ hired worker _with his_ wages, _the_ widow and _the_ orphan, and _the abusers of_ ^[Literally "_those_ pushing aside"] _the_ alien, ^[Or "sojourner"] and _yet_ do not fear me," says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v6
"For I, Yahweh, have not changed, ^[Or "I do not change"] and you, O children of Jacob, have not perished. ^[Or "are not destroyed"]

###### v7
From the days of your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] you have turned aside from my rules, and have not kept ^[Or "observed"] _them_! Return to me and I will return to you," says Yahweh of hosts, "but you say, 'How shall we return?'

###### v8
Will a human _dare to_ rob God? Yet you _are_ robbing me! And you say, 'How have we robbed you?' In the tithes and the contributions!

###### v9
You _are_ being cursed with _a_ curse, for you _are_ robbing me, the whole nation _of you_!

###### v10
Bring the whole tithe to _the storehouse_, ^[Hebrew "the house of the treasure"] so that there will be food in my house, and test me please in this," says Yahweh of hosts, "if I will not open for you the windows of heaven, and pour forth for you _an overflowing blessing_. ^[Literally, "a blessing up to not enough"]

###### v11
I will rebuke the devourer ^[NRSV, JPS interpret this word as "locust"] for you; it will not destroy the fruit of your soil; your vine in the field will not be unfruitful," says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v12
"And all the nations will call you blessed, because you will be _a land in which one takes joy_," ^[Literally "a land of desire"] says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v13
"Your words have been harsh ^[Hebrew "strong"] against me," says Yahweh. "But you say, 'How have we spoken together against you?'

###### v14
You have said, '_It is_ useless ^[Or "vain"] to serve God! What _is the_ gain if we keep ^[Or "observe"] his requirements, and if we walk as mourners _before_ ^[Literally "from the face of"] Yahweh of hosts?

###### v15
And now we _are_ calling _the_ arrogant blessed! Not only do those who do wickedness prosper; they also test God and they escape!'"

###### v16
Then those who revered ^[Or "fear"] Yahweh spoke _with one another_. ^[Literally "each with his friend/companion"] And Yahweh listened attentively ^[Or "gave heed"] and heard, and a scroll of remembrance was written _before him_ ^[Literally "to the face of him"] of those who revere ^[Or "fear"] Yahweh and ponder his name.

###### v17
"They will be mine," says Yahweh of hosts, "on the day that I _am_ acting, _my_ treasured possession. I will have compassion on them as a man has compassion on his son who serves him.

###### v18
You will return and see _the difference_ between _the_ righteous and _the_ wicked, between _the one who_ serves God and the one who does not serve him.
