[[Mic-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
The word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah, that he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem:

###### v2
Hear, all you peoples;
give heed, O earth and its fullness.
And let the Lord Yahweh be against you as a witness,
the Lord from _his holy temple_. ^[Literally "the temple of his holiness"]

###### v3
For behold, Yahweh is coming out from his place,
and he will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.

###### v4
The mountains will melt under him
and the valleys will burst open,
like wax before the fire,
like water rushing down a slope.

###### v5
All this _is_ for the rebellion of Jacob,
and for the sins of the house of Israel.
What _is_ the rebellion of Jacob?
_Is it_ not Samaria?
And what _are_ the high places of Judah?
_Are they_ not Jerusalem?

###### v6
So I will make Samaria as a heap of rubble in the field,
a place for planting a vineyard.
And I will pour down her stones into the valley
and uncover her foundations.

###### v7
Then all her idols will be broken in pieces,
and all her prostitution wages will be burned in the fire,
and all her idols I will make a desolation,
For from the wage of a prostitute she gathered _them_,
and to the wage of a prostitute they will return.

###### v8
On account of this I will lament and wail.
I will go about barefoot and naked.
I will make a lamentation like the jackals,
and a mourning ceremony like the _ostriches_. ^[Literally "daughters of an ostrich"]

###### v9
For her wounds _are_ incurable,
because it has come to Judah.
It has reached to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem.

###### v10
Do not tell _it_ in Gath;
you must not weep at all.
In Beth-le-Aphrah
roll yourself _in_ dust.

###### v11
Pass on, you inhabitants of Shaphir,
in naked shame.
The inhabitants of Zaanan do not come forth;
the wailing of Beth-ha-Ezel will take its protection from you.

###### v12
For the inhabitants of Maroth
writhed for good,
because disaster has come down from Yahweh
to the gate of Jerusalem.

###### v13
Harness the chariot to the team of horses,
O inhabitants of Lachish;
it _is_ the beginning of sin
for the daughter of Zion,
for the transgressions of Israel
were found in you.

###### v14
Therefore you will give parting gifts
to Moresheth-Gath;
the houses of Achzib _will be_ a deception
to the kings of Israel.

###### v15
I will again bring the conqueror upon you,
O inhabitants of Mareshah;
the glory of Israel
will come to Adullam.

###### v16
Make yourselves bald
and cut off your hair
for the children of your pleasure.
Expand your baldness as the eagle,
for they will go into exile away from you.
