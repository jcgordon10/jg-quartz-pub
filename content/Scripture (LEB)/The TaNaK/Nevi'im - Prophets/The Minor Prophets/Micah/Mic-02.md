###### v1
Woe _to_ those who plan wickedness
and evil deeds upon their beds!
In the light of the morning they did it,
because they have power in their hands.

###### v2
They covet fields and seize _them_,
and houses, and they take _them_ away.
They oppress a man and his house;
a man and his inheritance.

###### v3
Therefore, thus says Yahweh: Look! I am planning disaster against this family from which you will not be able to remove your necks. You will not walk proudly, for it _is_ a time of disaster.

###### v4
In that day they will raise a proverb against you,
and will wail a bitter wailing, saying,
"We are utterly ruined;
he exchanges _the_ portion of my people.
How he removes _it_ from me;
he apportions our field to an apostate."

###### v5
Therefore you will have no one casting a line by lot
in the assembly of Yahweh.

###### v6
"Do not preach!" they are preaching.
They should not preach to these;
disgrace will not overtake us.

###### v7
Should _this_ be said, O house of Jacob?
Is the patience ^[Or "spirit"] of Yahweh shortened?
_Are_ these his deeds?
Are my words not pleasing
to him who walks upright?

###### v8
But _recently_ ^[Literally "yesterday"] my people have risen up as an enemy;
from before the cloak you strip off the robe
from those passing by _in_ confidence,
returning _from_ war.

###### v9
You have driven out the women of my people
from the houses of their ^[Hebrew "her"] pleasure.
From their ^[Hebrew "her"] children you have taken away
my glory forever.

###### v10
Arise and go,
for this _is_ no resting place,
on account of uncleanness _that_ destroys
with painful destruction.

###### v11
If a man walks about in a spirit of deception and lies,
_saying_ "I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,"
then he would be a preacher _for_ this people!

###### v12
I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob;
I will surely gather together the remainder of Israel.
I will set them like sheep of Bozrah.
Like a herd in the midst of their pasture
they will be in tumult from people.

###### v13
The one who breaks out before them goes up;
they break through and pass the gate,
going out through it.
Their king passes before them,
Yahweh at their head.
