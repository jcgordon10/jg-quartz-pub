###### v1
And I said,
"Listen, O heads of Jacob
and leaders of the house of Israel!
_Is it_ not for you to know justice?

###### v2
_Those of you who are_ haters of good
and lovers of evil,
_who_ tear their skin from them
and their flesh from their bones,

###### v3
and who eat the flesh of my people,
and strip their skin from them,
and break their bones,
and chop _them_ like meat in the pot,
and like flesh in the midst of a cooking pot."

###### v4
Then they will cry to Yahweh,
but he will not answer them.
He will hide his face from them at that time,
when they have made their deeds evil.

###### v5
Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets
who are leading my people astray,
who are biting with their teeth
and proclaim, "Peace,"
but whoever puts nothing into their mouths
they declare war against.

###### v6
Therefore _it will be as_ night to you, without vision,
and darkness to you, without divination.
And the sun will set on the prophets,
and the day will grow dark over them.

###### v7
Then the seers will be disgraced,
and those practicing divination will be put to shame.
All of them will cover their lips,
for there is no reply from God.

###### v8
But I, I am filled _with_ power,
with the Spirit of Yahweh,
and with justice and might,
to declare to Jacob his rebellion,
and to Israel his sin.

###### v9
Hear this, O rulers of the house of Jacob
and leaders of the house of Israel,
those detesting justice
and perverting all that _is_ right,

###### v10
he who builds Zion with blood
and Jerusalem with wickedness.

###### v11
Its rulers judge for a bribe;
its priests teach for a price;
its prophets practice divination for money.
But they lean on Yahweh, saying,
"_Is_ not Yahweh in our midst?
Disaster will not come upon us."

###### v12
Therefore on account of you
Zion will be plowed _as_ a field,
and Jerusalem will be a heap of rubble,
and _the temple mount_ ^[Literally "the mountain of the house"] as a high place _in_ a forest.
