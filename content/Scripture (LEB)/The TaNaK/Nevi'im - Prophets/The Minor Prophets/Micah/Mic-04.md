###### v1
And it will be _that_ at the end of those days,
the mountain of Yahweh
will be established as the highest of the mountains,
and it will be lifted up above the hills,
and people will stream to it.

###### v2
And many nations will come and say,
"Come! Let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
and to the _temple_ ^[Literally "house"] of the God of Jacob,
that he may teach us his ways,
and that we may walk in his paths,"
for the law will go out from Zion,
and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.

###### v3
And he will judge between many peoples
and will arbitrate for strong nations far away;
and they will beat their swords into plowshares
and their spears into pruning hooks;
nation will not lift up a sword against a nation,
and they will no longer learn war.

###### v4
But they will sit, each under his vine
and under his fig tree,
and no one will make them afraid,
for the mouth of Yahweh of hosts has spoken.

###### v5
For all the nations walk,
each in the name of its god,
but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God,
forever and ever.

###### v6
"In that day," _declares Yahweh,_ ^[Literally "a declaration of Yahweh"]
"I will assemble the one who limps,
and I will gather the one who has been scattered,
and _those_ whom I have mistreated.

###### v7
And I will make the one who limps a remnant,
and the one driven far away a strong nation,
and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion
from now to forever.

###### v8
And you, O Migdal-Eder, ^[Or "tower of the flock"]
hill of the daughter of Zion,
to you it will come,
and the former dominion will come,
_the_ reign of the daughter of Jerusalem.

###### v9
So then, why do you shout a loud shout?
Is there no king in you?
Has your counselor perished
that pangs like a woman in labor have seized you?

###### v10
Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion,
like a woman in labor.
For now you will go forth from the city,
and you will camp in the field;
you will go to Babylon.
There you will be rescued;
there Yahweh will redeem you
from the hand of your enemies.

###### v11
And now, many nations are gathered against you
who are saying, 'Let her be defiled,
and let our eyes gaze upon Zion.'

###### v12
But they do not know the thoughts of Yahweh,
and they do not understand his plan,
that he has gathered them as sheaves
to his threshing floor.

###### v13
Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion,
for your horn I will make _as_ iron
and your hooves _as_ bronze.
And you will break many peoples in pieces,
and their gain you will devote to destruction to Yahweh,
and their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth."
