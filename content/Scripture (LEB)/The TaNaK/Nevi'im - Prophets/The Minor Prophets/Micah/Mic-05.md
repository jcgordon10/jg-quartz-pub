###### v1
 ^[[[Mic-05|Micah 5:1–15]] in the English Bible is 4:14–5:14 in the Hebrew Bible] Now muster troops, O daughter of troops;
a siege he puts against us.
They strike the ruler of Israel
with a rod on the cheek.

###### v2
But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,
_too_ small to be among the clans of Judah,
from you one will go out for me,
to be ruler in Israel;
and his origins _are_ from of old,
from ancient days.

###### v3
Therefore he will give them up
until the time of she who is with child has given birth.
And the rest of his brothers will return
to the children of Israel.

in the strength of Yahweh,
in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God.

###### v5
And this one will be peace.
_As for_ the Assyrian, ^[Hebrew "Assyria"] when he comes into our land
and when he treads on our fortresses,
then we will raise up against him seven shepherds
and eight leaders of men.

###### v6
And they will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,
and the land of Nimrod at its entrances.
And he will rescue _us_ from the Assyrian ^[Hebrew "Assyria"]
when he comes into our land,
and when they tread upon our border.

in the midst of many nations,
like dew from Yahweh,
like showers upon the grass
which does not wait for a man,
nor delays for the children of humankind.

###### v8
And the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations,
in the midst of many peoples,
like a lion among the wild animals of the forest,
like a young lion among the herds of sheep
which, when it passes through and treads _down_
and tears in pieces, there is none who _can_ deliver.

Your hand will be lifted high over your enemies,
and all your foes will be cut off.
