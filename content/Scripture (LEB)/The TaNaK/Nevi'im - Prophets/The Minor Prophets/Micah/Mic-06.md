[[Mic-05|Previous Chapter]] | [[Mic-07|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Hear now what Yahweh says:
"Arise! Plead _your case_ with the mountains,
and let the hills hear your voice."

###### v2
Hear, O mountains, the indictment of Yahweh,
and you eternal foundations of the earth,
for Yahweh has an indictment against his people,
and against Israel he contends.

###### v3
"O my people, what have I done to you,
and how have I wearied you? Answer me!

###### v4
For I brought you up from the land of Egypt,
and from the house of slavery I redeemed you.
And I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before you.

###### v5
O my people, remember what Balak the king of Moab devised,
and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him,
and _what happened from_ Shittim to Gilgal,
so that you might know the righteous acts of Yahweh."

###### v6
With what shall I approach Yahweh,
and bow down to God on high?
Shall I approach him with burnt offerings,
with bull calves a year old?

###### v7
Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams,
with myriads of rivers of oil?
Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression,
the fruit of my body _for the_ sin of my soul?

###### v8
He has told you, O mortal, what _is_ good,
and what does Yahweh ask from you
but to do justice, and to love kindness,
and to walk humbly with your God?

###### v9
The voice of Yahweh calls to the city
(_it is_ sound judgment to fear your name):
"Hear, _O_ staff! ^[Or "tribe"] Now who has appointed it?

###### v10
Is there any longer a man _in_ the house of the wicked
treasures of wickedness,
and the ephah of scarcity _which is_ accursed? ^[The meaning of the Hebrew text is uncertain]

###### v11
Shall I regard as pure _the one_ with scales of wickedness,
and with a bag of deceitful weights?

###### v12
Because her rich are full of violence,
and her inhabitants speak lies,
and their tongue _is_ deceitful in their mouth.

###### v13
And I also _have made you sick by striking you down_, ^[Literally "I have made sick to strike you down"]
making _you_ desolate because of your sins.

###### v14
You yourself will eat but not be satisfied;
your hunger _will be_ in your midst,
and you will put away, but you will not save,
and what you save I will hand over to the sword.

###### v15
You yourself will sow, but you will not reap;
you will tread olives, but you will not anoint yourself with oil;
_you will tread_ grapes, but you will not drink wine.

###### v16
For you have observed the regulations of Omri
and all the works of the house of Ahab.
And you have walked in their counsels,
so that I am making you a desolation
and your inhabitants an object of scorn.
So you will bear the scorn of my people.
