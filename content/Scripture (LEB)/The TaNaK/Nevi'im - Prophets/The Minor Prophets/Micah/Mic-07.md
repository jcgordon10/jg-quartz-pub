[[Mic-06|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Woe is me! For I have become
like the gatherings of summer,
like the gleanings of the grape harvest,
_when_ there is no cluster of grapes to eat
_or_ early ripened fruit _that_ my soul desires.

###### v2
The faithful _person_ has perished from the land,
and there is none who is upright among humankind.
All of them lie in wait;
each hunts his brother _with_ a net.

###### v3
Their hands _are_ upon evil, to do _it_ well;
the official and the judge ask for the bribe,
and the great _man_ utters the evil desire of his soul;
and they weave _it_ together.

###### v4
The best of them _is_ like a brier;
_the most_ upright _worse_ than a thorn hedge.
The day of your watchman, your punishment, has come;
now their confusion will come.

###### v5
Do not put faith in a friend;
put no trust in a close friend.
Guard the doorways of your mouth
from the one who lies in your lap.

###### v6
For a son treats a father with contempt;
a daughter rises up against her mother,
a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
_the_ enemies of a man _are_ the men of his own house.

###### v7
But _as for_ me, I will look to Yahweh;
I will wait for the God of my salvation.
My God will hear me.

###### v8
You should not rejoice over me, O my enemy!
When I fall I will stand up;
when I sit in darkness
Yahweh _will be_ a light for me.

###### v9
I will bear the rage of Yahweh,
for I have sinned against him,
until he pleads my cause
and executes my justice.
He will bring me out to the light;
I will see his righteousness.

###### v10
Then my enemy will see,
and shame will cover her who said to me,
"Where _is_ Yahweh your God?"
My eyes will look upon her;
now she will become a trampling place,
like mud in the streets.

###### v11
A day for building your walls;
_on_ that day he will extend _your_ boundary.

###### v12
_On_ that day he will come to you
from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
and from Egypt to the River,
and from sea to sea
and mountain to mountain.

###### v13
But the earth will be a desolation
because of its inhabitants,
for the fruit of their deeds.

###### v14
Shepherd your people with your staff,
the flock of your inheritance,
those dwelling alone _in_ a forest
in the midst of Carmel.
Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead,
as _in_ the days of old.

###### v15
As _in_ the days when you came out
from the land of Egypt
I will show him wondrous things.

###### v16
The nations will see and be ashamed
because of all their might.
They will lay _the_ hand on _the_ mouth;
their ears will be deaf.

###### v17
They will lick the dust like the serpent,
like the crawling things of the earth.
They will come trembling from their strongholds
to Yahweh our God.
Let them fear and be afraid of you.

###### v18
Who _is_ a God like you, forgiving sin
and passing over rebellion for the remnant of his inheritance?
He does not retain his anger forever,
for he delights in loyal love.

###### v19
_He will again have compassion_ ^[Literally "He will return, he will have compassion"] on us;
he will trample our iniquities.
And you will hurl all their sins
in the depths of the sea.

###### v20
You will show faithfulness to Jacob,
and loyal love to Abraham,
as you have sworn to our ancestors ^[Or "fathers"]
from the days of old.
