[[Nah-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
The oracle concerning Nineveh--
the scroll of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:

###### v2
Yahweh is a jealous God and avenging;
Yahweh is avenging and _full of wrath_. ^[Literally "a lord of wrath"]
Yahweh takes vengeance against his enemies;
he rages against his adversaries.

###### v3
Yahweh is slow to anger but great _in_ power;
he will certainly not allow _the guilty_ to go unpunished.
_He marches_ ^[Literally "His path"] in storm wind and in gale;
storm clouds _are the_ dust of his feet.

###### v4
He rebukes the sea and he dries up the rivers;
he makes all the rivers run dry.
Bashan and Carmel wither; ^[MT reads "languishes," but the versions reflect "withers," which also restores the acrostic]
the blossom of Lebanon languishes.

###### v5
Mountains quake before him;
the hills shake apart. ^[Or "melt"]
The earth heaves before him--
the world and all her inhabitants.

###### v6
His indignation--who can stand before it?
Who can endure _his fierce anger_? ^[Literally "the heat of his anger"]
His wrath is poured out like fire;
rocks are shattered before ^[Or "by"] him.

###### v7
Yahweh is good--a refuge in _the_ day of distress;
_he knows_ those who take refuge in him.

###### v8
But with a rushing torrent he will bring _Nineveh_ to an end;
he will chase his enemies into darkness.

###### v9
What ^[Or "Why …?"] do you plot against Yahweh?
_He will completely destroy it_; ^[Literally "he will make a complete destruction"]
trouble will not rise up a second time!

###### v10
For like entangled thorns,
and like their drink which is drunk,
they will be consumed like fully dry chaff.

###### v11
From you goes out one who plots evil against Yahweh,
one who plans wickedness.

###### v12
Yahweh says this:
"Even though _they are_ powerful and likewise many,
even so they will be cut off and pass away.
Though I have afflicted you, ^[That is, Judah]
I will afflict you ^[That is, Judah] no longer.

###### v13
And now, I will break his yoke from upon you;
I will snap your bonds."

###### v14
Yahweh has commanded concerning you:
"Your name will no longer be sown.
I will cut off _the idols and images_ ^[Literally "the idols and the molten idols"] from the _temple_ ^[Literally "house"] of your gods;
_I will send you to the grave_ ^[Literally "I will make your grave"] because you are worthless."

###### v15
 ^[[[Nah-01#v15|Nahum 1:15–2:13]] in the English Bible is 2:1–14 in the Hebrew Bible] Look! On the mountains!
The feet of the one who brings good tidings,
the one who proclaims peace!
"Celebrate _a festival_, O Judah,
Fulfill your vows!
For he will not invade you again;
the wicked one is cut off completely!"
