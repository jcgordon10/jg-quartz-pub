###### v1
_One who shatters_ ^[Literally "a shatterer"] has come up against you!
Guard _the_ fortification!
Watch _the_ road! ^[Or "way"]
Gird _your_ loins!
_Muster_ ^[Or "Collect"] all _your_ strength!

###### v2
For Yahweh will restore the majesty of Jacob
like the majesty of Israel;
for ravagers have ravaged them
and ruined _their_ branches.

###### v3
The shields of his warriors _are_ dyed red;
The powerful men _are_ dressed in scarlet.
The metal of the chariots ^[Hebrew "chariot"] _shines_ like fire _on the day of battle_, ^[Literally "on the day of his preparation"]
and _their_ spears quiver.

###### v4
The chariots ^[Hebrew "chariot"] race madly through the streets;
they rush back and forth in the public squares.
Their appearance like lightning bolts,
they dart about like flashes of lightning.

###### v5
He calls his officers;
they stumble as they march;
they rush to her wall;
they set the covering ^[The Hebrew word describes a small portable roof to protect siege warriors from arrows and debris hurled at them from the fortified city wall] in place.

###### v6
The gates of the river are opened;
the palace trembles.

###### v7
_Her goddess is taken out and taken into exile_; ^[Literally "It is decreed _that_ she be exiled _and_ led away." MT reads the very enigmatic "And he is placed, she is sent into exile, she is taken up." The BHS editors suggest the conjectural emendation "And her goddess _= the idol of the patron deity of Nineveh_ is taken and taken into exile." This is adopted in the translation on the basis of internal evidence]
her maidservants moan like doves;
they beat on their breasts.

###### v8
Nineveh _is_ like a pool of water without its water. ^[MT reads "from her days." Greek LXX and Syriac Peshitta reflect "from her waters"]
_As they flee_, ^[Literally "And they flee away"] _she cries,_ "Stop! Stop!"
But there is no one who turns back.

###### v9
Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!
There is no end to the spoils, ^[Literally "the supply"]
an abundance of _everything one could want_! ^[Literally "every kind of desirable object"]

###### v10
Emptiness and plundering and devastation!
Their hearts faint and their knees tremble, ^[Or "totter"]
_All their loins shake_ ^[Literally "And shaking of all loins"] and all their faces _turn_ ^[Literally "gather"] pale.

###### v11
Where _now_ _is_ the den of _the_ lions
and _the_ cave of the fierce lions?
There the lioness, the cub, and the lion once _prowled_, ^[Literally "went"]
_and no one disturbed them_. ^[Literally "there _is_ no one making _them_ afraid"]

###### v12
The lion tore apart enough _prey_ for his cubs,
he strangled _prey_ for his lioness;
he filled _his lair_ ^[Literally "his holes"] _with_ prey
and his den _with_ mangled carcass.

###### v13
"Look! I am against you!" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts.
"I will burn her chariots _with fire_; ^[Literally "with smoke"]
the sword will devour fierce lions.
I will cut off your prey from the earth;
the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard."
