Woe to the city _that has shed_ _much blood_! ^[Literally "bloods"]
_She is a deceiver_, ^[Literally "All of her _is_ deception"]
She is filled _with_ plunder,
_She has hoarded her spoils of war_. ^[Literally "Prey does not depart"]

###### v2
The crack of the whip!
The rumbling of the _chariot_ wheel!
The galloping of the horse!
The racing of the chariot!

###### v3
Chariots charge!
Swords flash!
Spears glitter!
_Many corpses are piled high_! ^[Literally "Many dead, piles of corpses"]
There is no end to the slain!
They stumble over their dead!

###### v4
"Because of the many idolatries of _the_ prostitute,
the beautiful charm _of_ a mistress of witchcraft,
she who enslaves nations by her harlotries,
and peoples by her sorceries,

###### v5
"Look! I am against you!" _declares_ ^[Literally "a declaration of"]Yahweh.
"I will strip up your skirts over your face;
I will let nations look _at_ your nakedness and your shame.

###### v6
"I will throw filth upon you,
I will treat you with contempt,
I will make you a spectacle.

###### v7
"And it will be that everyone who sees you will flee from you,
And _they_ ^[Hebrew "he"] will say, 'Nineveh is destroyed!'
Who will mourn for her?
From whence shall I seek comforters for you?"

###### v8
Are you better than Thebes? ^[Hebrew "No-Amon"]
She who sits at the Nile, surrounded by her waters,
her rampart _was the_ sea and water _was_ her wall.

###### v9
Cush _was_ her strength, Egypt without end;
Put and Libya were among _your allies_. ^[Literally "your helpers"]

###### v10
Yet she went into captivity as an exile;
her children were dashed to pieces at the head of _the_ streets;
they cast lots for all of her nobles;
all of her dignitaries were bound with chains.

###### v11
You also will behave like a drunkard;
You also will hide yourself;
You also will seek refuge from _the_ enemy.

###### v12
All of your fortifications _are like_ fig trees with _ripe_ firstfruits--
if they are shaken, they will fall into the mouth of the eater.

###### v13
Look! Your troops _are like_ women in your midst.
The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies;
fire will consume the bars _of your gates_.

###### v14
Draw water for a siege!
Strengthen your fortifications!
Go to the mud _pit_!
Trample the clay!
Grasp the brick mold!

###### v15
There fire will consume you;
the sword will cut you off.
It will consume you like the locust.
Multiply yourself like the locust!
Multiply yourself like the grasshopper!

###### v16
You have increased your merchants more than the stars of heaven;
_like_ the locust they will shed _their skin_ and fly away.

###### v17
Your officials _are_ like locusts;
your commanders _are_ like a swarm of locusts.
They encamp on the walls on a cold day;
when the sun rises, they fly away--
no one knows where they have gone.

###### v18
Your shepherds are sleeping, _O_ king of Assyria!
Your nobles slumber.
Your people are scattered on the mountains;
no one can gather them.

###### v19
There is no healing for your wound;
your injury is fatal.
All who hear the report of you will clap _their_ hands _for joy_ concerning you,
_For who has not suffered at the hands of your endless cruelty_? ^[Literally "For over whom has your endless cruelty not passed?"]
