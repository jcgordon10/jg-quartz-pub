###### v5
"Your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?

###### v8
_I had a vision in the night_, ^[Literally "I saw the night," which means "I had a vision"] and look, a man riding on a red horse. And he _was_ standing between the myrtle shrubs that _were_ in the ravine, and behind him _were_ red, reddish-brown, and white horses.

###### v9
And I asked, "What _are_ these, my lord?" And the angel _who was_ talking with me said, "I will show you what these are."

###### v10
And the man standing between the myrtle shrubs answered and said, "These _are_ those whom Yahweh has sent to patrol ^[Or "to go about," or "to walk through"] _the_ earth."

###### v11
And they answered the angel of Yahweh who was standing between the myrtle shrubs, and they said, "We have patrolled ^[Or "have gone about," or "have walked through"] the earth, and look, all the earth _is dwelling in peace_." ^[Literally "_is_ dwelling and _is_ at rest"]

###### v12
The angel of Yahweh answered and said, "O Yahweh of hosts, _how long_ ^[Literally "until when"] will you have no compassion on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, _with_ which you showed fury these seventy years?" ^[Hebrew "year"]

###### v13
_With_ gracious ^[Or "kind"; literally "good"] and comforting words Yahweh answered the angel who was talking with me.

###### v14
And the angel who was talking with me said to me, "Proclaim, saying, 'Thus says Yahweh of hosts: "_I am very jealous_ ^[Literally "I am jealous _with_ a great jealousy"] for Jerusalem and for Zion!

And _I am extremely angry_ ^[Literally "_With_ a great anger I am angry"] with the nations that are at ease, for _while_ I was a little angry, they _furthered disaster_." ^[Literally "helped disaster"]

###### v20
Then Yahweh showed me four skilled craftsmen,

###### v21
and I asked, "What _are_ these coming to do?" And he answered, saying, "These _are_ the horns that scattered Judah, _so that no man_ ^[Literally "according to the mouth of a man"] lifted up his head; but these have come to frighten them, to strike down the horns of the nations that lifted a horn against the land of Judah to scatter it."
