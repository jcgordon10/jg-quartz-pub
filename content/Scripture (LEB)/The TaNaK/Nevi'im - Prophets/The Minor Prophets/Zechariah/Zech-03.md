###### v2
But Yahweh said to Satan, ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] "Yahweh rebukes you, O Satan! ^[Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"] Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebukes you! _Is_ this not a stick snatched from the fire?"

###### v3
And Joshua was clothed _in_ filthy garments and was standing _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the angel.

###### v4
And he answered and said to the ones standing _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] him, saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him." And he said to him, "See, I have taken away your guilt ^[The Hebrew term refers to guilt caused by sin (HALOT 800 s.v. [[Zech-03#v2|2]])] from you, and will clothe you _with_ rich garments."

###### v5

###### v7
"Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 'If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my requirements, then you will judge ^[Or "govern"] my house, and you will also guard my courtyards, and I will give to you passageways ^[Or "right of access"] among these that are standing here.

###### v8
Listen, please, O Joshua the high priest, you and your companions ^[Possibly his fellow priests] that are sitting _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] you. For _the_ men _are_ a sign that, ^[Hebrew "for"] look, I _am_ going to bring my servant _the_ Branch. ^[Hebrew "Sprout" or "Shoot" ("Branch" is a traditional rendering in English)]

###### v9
For consider, the stone that _I set before_ ^[Literally "I gave to the face of, "or "I gave in the presence of"] Joshua, on one stone _are_ seven eyes. ^[Or "facets"] Look, _I am going to engrave an inscription on it_,' ^[Literally "I _am_ going to engrave its engraving"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts, 'and I will remove the guilt of that land in a single day.

###### v10
On that day,' _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts, 'you will invite _one another_ ^[Literally "a man to his friend"] under _the_ vine and under _the_ fig tree.'"
