###### v1
And the angel _who was_ talking with me returned, and he wakened me as one who is wakened from his sleep.

###### v2
And he said to me, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see, and look, _a lampstand all of gold_, ^[Literally "a lampstand of gold in its totality"] and a bowl _was_ on its top, and its seven lamps on it, and seven lips on _each of_ the lamps that _are_ on its top.

###### v3
And _there are_ two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left."

###### v4
And I answered and said to the angel _who was_ talking to me, "What _are_ these, my lord?"

###### v5
And the angel _who was_ talking with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these _are_?" And I said, "No, my lord."

###### v6
And he answered and said to me, "This _is_ the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel, saying, 'Not by strength and not by power, but _only_ by my Spirit,' says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v7
'Who _are_ you O great mountain? _Before_ ^[Literally "To the face of"] Zerubbabel _you will become_ level ground, and he will bring out the top stone amid the shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'"

###### v8
And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

###### v9
"The hands of Zerubbabel have founded this house, and his hands will finish it. And you will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you.

###### v10
For whoever has despised the day of small _things_ will rejoice and will see the _plumb line_ ^[Literally "the tin stone"; this could refer to a plumb line or a plummet] in the hand of Zerubbabel."
These seven _are_ the eyes of Yahweh which _are_ ranging _throughout the whole earth_. ^[Literally "in all the earth"]

###### v11
And I answered and said to him, "What _are_ these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?"

###### v12
And I replied a second _time_ and asked him, "What _are_ these two twigs of olive trees ^[Or "two clusters of olive branches"; literally "two ears of grain," perhaps based on similarity of shape] on the right of the lampstand and on its left?"

###### v13
And he replied to me, "Do you not know what these _are_?" And I said, "No, my lord."

###### v14
And he said, "These _are_ the two _anointed ones_ ^[Literally "sons of the olive oil"] standing by the Lord of the whole earth."
