###### v1
_I looked up again_, ^[Literally "I did again, I lifted up my eyes"] and I saw, and look!--a flying scroll!

###### v3
And he said to me, "This _is_ the curse going out over the surface of the whole earth. For everyone who steals has gone unpunished ^[Many translations render this verb as "will be cut off"] according to it, and _likewise_ everyone who swears _falsely_ has gone unpunished according to it.

###### v4
'I have sent it out,' _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts, 'and it will go into the house of the thief and into the house of the one swearing _falsely by my name_, ^[Literally "by my name to lie"] and it will spend the night in that ^[Hebrew "his"] house and will destroy it, with its timber and its stone.'"

###### v5
And the angel who was speaking to me went out, and he said to me, "_Please look up_! ^[Literally "Lift, please, your eyes!"] See what this _is_ going out."

###### v6
And I asked, "What _is_ it?" And he said, "This _is_ a basket ^[Or "an ephah," a measure of grain] going out. And he said, "This _is_ their iniquity ^[Hebrew "eye"; other ancient versions (LXX, Syriac) read "iniquity"] throughout all the earth.

###### v7
And look, the lead cover was lifted and a woman _was_ sitting inside the basket. ^[Or "ephah," a measure of grain]

###### v8
And he said, "This _is_ Wickedness!" And he thrust her _back down_ into the basket, ^[Or "ephah," a measure of grain] and threw the lead cover on top of it. ^[That is, on top of the "basket" or "ephah"]

###### v9
And I _looked up_ ^[Literally "lifted up my eyes"] and saw, and look!--two women coming forward, and _the_ wind _was_ in their wings, and they had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket ^[Or "ephah," a measure of grain] between the earth and the sky. ^[Or "heaven"]
