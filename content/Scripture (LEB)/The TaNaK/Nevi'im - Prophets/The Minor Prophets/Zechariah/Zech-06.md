[[Zech-05|Previous Chapter]] | [[Zech-07|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
_I looked up again_, ^[Literally "I did again, I lifted up my eyes"] and I saw, and look!--four chariots coming out from between two mountains, and the mountains _were_ mountains of bronze.

###### v2
With the first chariot _there were_ red horses, and with the second chariot _there were_ black horses.

###### v3
And with the third chariot _there were_ white horses, and with the fourth chariot _there were_ strong ^[Other ancient versions read "grey" here] dappled horses.

###### v4
And I answered and said to the angel _that was_ talking to me, "What _are_ these, my lord?"

###### v5
And the angel answered and said to me, "These _are_ the four winds ^[Or "spirits" (The same Hebrew word can be translated "wind" or "spirit" depending on the context)] of the heavens going out after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth.

###### v6
_The one with_ ^[Literally "Her with which"] the black horses _is_ going out to _the_ north country, and the white _horses_ go after them, ^[Some interpret the word "after" to indicate a westward direction] while the dappled _ones_ go to the south country."

###### v7
When the strong _horses_ went out, they were anxious to go to patrol the earth. And he ^[That is, "Lord of all the earth"] said, "Go, patrol the earth." And they patrolled the earth.

###### v8
And he cried out to me and said to me, "See those going out to _the_ north country have set my spirit at rest in the north country."

###### v9
And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

###### v10
"Collect ^[The imperative "Collect" has no object; many translations supply "silver and gold" or "an offering"] from the exiles--from Heldai, Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, _all of_ whom came from Babylon--and go on that day, go _to the_ house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.

###### v11
Take _the_ silver and gold and make a crown, and set _it_ on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.

###### v12
And say to him, 'Thus says Yahweh of hosts: "Look, _here is_ a man whose name _is_ Branch, ^[Hebrew "Sprout" or "Shoot" ("Branch" is a traditional rendering in English)] and from his place he will sprout, and he will build the temple of Yahweh.

###### v13
And he will build the temple of Yahweh, and he will bear majesty and will sit and rule on his throne. And he shall be a priest on his throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two of them."' ^[That is, between king and priest]

###### v14
And the crown will be for Helem, ^["Helem" is probably another name for Heldai (v. [[Zech-06#v10|10]])] for Tobijah, for Jedaiah, and for Hen ^["Hen" is frequently understood as a reference to Josiah (v. [[Zech-06#v10|10]])] son of Zephaniah, as a memorial in the temple of Yahweh.

###### v15
And those who are far off will come and build the temple of Yahweh, and you will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you. And it will happen if you will listen diligently to the voice of Yahweh your God."
