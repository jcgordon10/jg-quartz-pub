[[Zech-06|Previous Chapter]] | [[Zech-08|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
_And then_, ^[Literally "and it happened"] in the fourth year of King Darius, the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah on _the_ fourth _day_ of the ninth month, _which is_ Kislev.

###### v2
And _the people of_ Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem-Melech, and their ^[Hebrew "his"] men, to entreat _the favor_ ^[Literally "the face"] of Yahweh,

###### v3
saying to the _priests of the house of Yahweh of hosts_ ^[Literally "priests who _are_ for the house of Yahweh of hosts"] and to the prophets, "Should I mourn in the fifth month and keep myself separate ^[Or "abstain"; some interpret this as a reference to fasting] as I have done for these many years?"

###### v4
And the word of Yahweh of hosts came to me, saying,

###### v5
"Say to all the people of the land and to the priests: 'When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and seventh months for these seventy years, did you really fast for me?

###### v6
And when you eat and drink, are you not eating and drinking _for yourselves_?

###### v7
_Are_ not _these_ the words that Yahweh proclaimed _through_ ^[Literally "by the hand of"] the former prophets, when Jerusalem and _its surrounding towns_ ^[Literally "her towns around her"] were inhabited and at ease, and the Negev ^[The Negev is an arid region south of the Judean hills] and the Shephelah ^[The Shephelah is a geographical area on the western edge of the Judean hills] were inhabited?'"

###### v8
And the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah, saying,

###### v9
"Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 'Judge _with_ trustworthy justice, and show ^[Literally "do"] steadfast love and compassion _to one another_. ^[Literally "a man his brother"]

###### v10
You must not oppress _the_ widow, _the_ orphan, _the_ foreigner, and _the_ needy. You must not devise evil in your heart _against one another_.' ^[Literally "a man his brother"]

###### v11
But they refused to listen, and turned ^[Hebrew "gave"] a stubborn shoulder and _stopped their ears from listening_. ^[Literally "their ears were heavy from hearing"]

###### v12
_They made their hearts adamant_ ^[Literally "They set their hearts _like_ hard stone"] in order not to hear the law ^[Hebrew _torah_] and the words that Yahweh of hosts had sent by his spirit through ^[Literally "by the hand of"] the former prophets; _therefore_ great wrath came from Yahweh of hosts.

###### v13
'Thus, just as I ^[Hebrew "he called" (but still referring to Yahweh)] called and they would not hear, so they will call and I will not hear,' says Yahweh of hosts.

###### v14
'And I scattered them with a wind among all the nations that they had not known; the land was made desolate behind them-- no one crossing through _it_ or returning--and they made the desirable land ^[Hebrew "land of desire," but this could be understood as a land characterized by desire rather than a desirable land] a desolation.'"
