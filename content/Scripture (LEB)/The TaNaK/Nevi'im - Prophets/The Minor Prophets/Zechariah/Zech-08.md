###### v1
And the word of Yahweh of hosts came, saying,

###### v2
"Thus says Yahweh of hosts: '_I am exceedingly jealous for Zion_; ^[Literally "I am jealous for Zion _with_ great jealousy"] I am jealous for it _with_ great wrath.'

###### v3
Thus says Yahweh: 'I have returned to Zion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be called the faithful city, ^[Or "the city of truth"] and the mountain of Yahweh of hosts _will be called_ the holy mountain.'

###### v4
Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 'Old men and old women shall again sit in the public squares of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand ^[Hebrew "a man his staff in his hand"] _because of great age_. ^[Literally "because of the multitude of days"]

###### v5
And the public squares of the city will be filled _with_ boys and girls playing in its public squares.'

###### v6
Thus says Yahweh of hosts: '_Even_ if it seems impossible ^[Or "wonderful"] _to the remnant_ ^[Literally "in the eyes of the remnant"] of this people in those days, should it also seem impossible ^[Or "wonderful"] _to me_?' ^[Literally "in my eyes"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts.

###### v7
Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 'Look! I _am_ going to save my people from the land of the east, and from the land of the west,

###### v8
and I will bring them and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. They will be my people and I will be their God in faithfulness ^[Or "truth"] and in righteousness.'

###### v9
"Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 'Let your hands be strong, you ^[Hebrew "the _ones_"] who are hearing in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who _were present_ on _the_ day _the foundation was laid for the rebuilding of the temple, the house of Yahweh of hosts_. ^[Literally "the temple, the house of Yahweh of hosts, was founded to be built"]

###### v10
For before those days there was no wage for people or for animals, and there was no safety from the enemy for those who went out or those who came in, and I sent each person against _one another_. ^[Literally "his neighbor"]

###### v11
But now _I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days_,' ^[Literally "not like the former days I _will be_ to the remnant"] _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts.

###### v12
'For _there will be_ a sowing of peace; the vine will give its fruit, and the soil will give its produce, and the heavens will give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these _things_.

###### v13
_And then_, ^[Literally "and it will happen"] just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you will be a blessing. You must not be afraid; let your hands be strong!'"

###### v14
For thus says Yahweh of hosts: "Just as I planned to bring disaster ^[Hebrew "evil"] on you when your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] provoked me to anger," says Yahweh of hosts, "and I did not regret _it_,

###### v15
_so again I have planned_ ^[Literally "[[Song-01|So I]] did again, I planned"] in these days to do good to Jerusalem and the house of Judah. Do not be afraid!

###### v16
These _are_ the things that you must do: speak truth, each _of you_, with his neighbor; practice trustworthy judgment and peace in your gates.

###### v17
Do not devise evil in your hearts _against_ your neighbor, and do not love _a false oath_, ^[Literally "an oath of deception"] because all these _are_ things I hate," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh.

###### v18
And the word of Yahweh of hosts came to me, saying

###### v19
"Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 'The fast of the fourth _month_, the fifth _month_, the seventh _month_, and the tenth _month_ will be for the house of Judah jubilation and joy and merry festivals; therefore love truth and peace.'

###### v20
Thus says Yahweh of hosts: '_It will happen_ again that nations and the inhabitants of many cities will come.

###### v21
And the inhabitants of one city will go to another _city_, saying, "Let us go immediately to entreat _the favor of_ ^[Literally "the face of"] Yahweh, to seek Yahweh of hosts--I also will go!"

###### v22
And many peoples and powerful ^[Or "mighty"] nations will come to seek Yahweh of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat _the favor of_ ^[Literally "the face of"] Yahweh.'

###### v23
Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 'In those days ten men from _all the nations of every language_ ^[Literally "all the languages of the nations"] will take hold of the hem of a Judean man, ^[Many versions translate "a Jew," but "Judean" highlights Zechariah's focus on provincial geography] saying, "Let us go with you, for we have heard _that_ God _is_ with you!"'"
