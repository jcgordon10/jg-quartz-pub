[[Zech-08|Previous Chapter]] | [[Zech-10|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
An oracle. The word of Yahweh _is_ against the land of Hadrach,
and Damascus _is_ its resting place.
For to Yahweh belongs the eye of humankind, ^["Eye of humankind" is difficult to understand in this context; some scholars emend the phrase to "cities of Aram" or "capital of Aram"]
and all the tribes of Israel,

###### v2
and also Hamath, _which_ borders on it;
Tyre and Sidon--yes, they are very wise! ^[That is, wise in their own eyes (ironic)]

###### v3
Tyre has built a fortification for itself, ^[Hebrew "her"]
and it heaped up silver like dust,
and gold like _the_ mud of _the_ streets.

###### v4
Look! The Lord will drive it ^[Hebrew "her"] out
and will hurl its ^[Hebrew "her"] outer ramparts into the sea,
and it ^[Hebrew "she"] will be consumed by fire.

###### v5
Ashkelon will see and will be afraid,
and Gaza will writhe exceedingly,
and Ekron _also_, because its hope is ruined. ^[Traditionally "ashamed"; some presuppose a different Hebrew form and translate "withered"]
And the king from Gaza will perish,
and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.

###### v6
A mongrel people ^[That is, a people of mixed marriage; "half-breeds"] will dwell in Ashdod,
and I will cut down the pride of _the_ Philistines.

###### v7
I will remove its ^[Hebrew "his"] blood from its ^[Hebrew "his"] mouth,
and its ^[Hebrew "his"] abominations from between its ^[Hebrew "his"] teeth.
And it ^[Hebrew "he"] too will be a remnant for our God;
and it ^[Hebrew "he"] will be like a tribal chief ^[This word is sometimes interpreted as "clan"] in Judah,
and Ekron _will be_ like _the_ Jebusite.

###### v8
But I will encamp at my temple ^[Or "house"] _like a_ guard,
against those crossing through and returning;
no oppressor will cross through them again,
for now I have seen with my _own_ eyes.

###### v9
Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!
Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem!
Look! Your king comes to you;
he _is_ righteous and victorious,
humble and riding on a donkey,
and on a male donkey, _the foal of_ ^[Literally "the son of "] a female donkey!

###### v10
And I will cut off _the_ chariot from Ephraim,
and _the_ horse from Jerusalem;
the battle bow will be cut down,
and he will announce peace to the nations.
His dominion _will be_ from sea to sea,
and from _the_ River ^[That is, the Euphrates] to _the_ ends of _the_ earth.

###### v11
_As for_ you also, because of the blood of your covenant,
I will release your prisoners from _the waterless pit_. ^[Literally "_the_ cistern there is not water in him"]

###### v12
Return to _the_ fortress,
O prisoners of hope;
today _I am_ declaring _that_ I will repay you double.

###### v13
For I have bent Judah _as_ my bow;
I have set Ephraim _as an arrow_.
I will set in motion your sons, O Zion,
against your sons, O Javan. ^[That is, Greece]
I will wield you like the sword of a warrior.

###### v14
Then Yahweh will appear over them,
and his arrow will go forth like lightning;
and my Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet,
and he shall go out in the storm winds of _the_ south.

###### v15
Yahweh of hosts will defend them,
and they will devour and subdue the slingstones; ^[Perhaps metonymy for the slingers of stones]
they will drink, they will make noise ^[LXX reads "they will drink blood like wine"] like wine,
and they will be full like the sacrificial basin, ^[That is, the ceremonial bowl used by the priest for sprinkling blood]
_drenched_ like the corners of an altar.

###### v16
And Yahweh their God will save them on that day,
as the flock of his people;
for _they are like_ the stones of a diadem,
glittering on his land.

###### v17
For how _great is_ his goodness, and how _great is_ his beauty!
Grain will make the young men thrive,
and new wine _the_ young women.
