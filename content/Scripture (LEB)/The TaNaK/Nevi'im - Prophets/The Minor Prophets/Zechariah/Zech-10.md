###### v1
Ask rain from Yahweh in the season of _the_ spring rain--
Yahweh, who makes storm clouds,
and he gives showers of rain to them,
to everyone vegetation in the field.

###### v2
Because the household gods ^[Hebrew _teraphim_] speak deceit,
and those who practice divination see a lie,
and the dreamers of vanity speak in vain.
Therefore _the people_ wander like sheep; ^[Or "flocks"; the Hebrew term refers collectively to both sheep and goats (small livestock animals)]
they are afflicted because there is no shepherd.

###### v3
_My anger burns_ ^[Literally "My nose becomes hot"] against the shepherds,
and I will punish the leaders, ^[Or "male goats"]
because Yahweh of hosts watches over his flock, ^[Or "herd"]
the house of Judah;
and he will make them like his majestic horse in war.

###### v4
From them ^[Hebrew "him" (or "it"), referring to the flock in v. [[Zech-10#v3|3]]] _the_ cornerstone will go out,
from them ^[Hebrew "him" (or "it"), referring to the flock in v. [[Zech-10#v3|3]]] _the_ tent peg,
from them ^[Hebrew "him" (or "it"), referring to the flock in v. [[Zech-10#v3|3]]] _the_ battle bow,
from them ^[Hebrew "him" (or "it"), referring to the flock in v. [[Zech-10#v3|3]]] every ruler,
_all_ together.

###### v5
And they will be like warriors,
trampling in the mud of _the_ streets in the battle.
They will fight, because Yahweh _is_ with them,
and they will put to shame _the_ riders on horses.

###### v6
And I will strengthen the house of Judah,
and the house of Joseph I will save.
And I will bring them back, because I have compassion on them,
and they will be as if I had not rejected them,
for I _am_ Yahweh their God, and I will answer them.

###### v7
And _the people of_ Ephraim will be like _a_ warrior,
and their heart will be glad as _with_ wine.
And their children will see and rejoice;
their heart will shout in exultation in Yahweh.

###### v8
I will whistle to them and gather them,
for I have redeemed them,
and they will become numerous as they have been numerous _before_.

###### v9
Though I sow ^[Or "scatter"] them among the nations,
in the distant places they will remember me,
and they will stay alive with their children, and they will return.

###### v10
And I will bring them back from the land of Egypt,
and from Assyria I will gather them.
To the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them,
until no _room_ will be found for them _there_.

###### v11
And he ^[LXX reads "they," referring to the Israelites (so NIV, NRSV, NASB)] will pass through the sea of distress,
and he will strike the waves of the sea,
and all _the_ depths of the Nile will dry up.
The pride of Assyria will be brought low,
and the scepter of Egypt will depart.

###### v12
I will make them strong in Yahweh,
and in his name they will walk,
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh.
