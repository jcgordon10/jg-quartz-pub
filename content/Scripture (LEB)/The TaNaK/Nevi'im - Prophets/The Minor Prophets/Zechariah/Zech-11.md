###### v1
Open your doors, _O_ Lebanon,
so that fire will devour your cedars!

###### v2
Wail, O juniper, ^[Or "cypress"] for _the_ cedar has fallen,
for _the_ magnificent _trees_ are ruined!
Wail, oaks of Bashan,
for the impenetrable forest has come down!

###### v3
_Listen to_ the wailing of the shepherds,
for their splendor is ruined!
_Listen to_ the roar of _the_ young lions,
for the thickets of the Jordan are ruined!

###### v4
Thus says Yahweh my God: "Shepherd the flock ^[The Hebrew term refers collectively to both sheep and goats (small livestock animals)] _doomed_ to slaughter.

###### v5
The ones buying them kill them and go unpunished, and the ones selling them say, 'Blessed _be_ Yahweh, for I have become rich.' Their own shepherds have no compassion for them.

###### v6
For I will no longer have compassion on the inhabitants of the land," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh. "Look, I _am_ going to cause humankind to fall, each into the hand of his neighbor, and into the hand of his king; and they will devastate the land, and I will not deliver _anyone_ from their hand."

###### v7
And I shepherded the flock ^[The Hebrew term refers collectively to both sheep and goats (small livestock animals)] _doomed_ to slaughter, even ^[Hebrew "therefore"] the afflicted ^[LXX reads "merchants _of the flock_" which is reflected in some English translations] of the flock. ^[The Hebrew term refers collectively to both sheep and goats (small livestock animals)] I took two staffs, one I called Kindness, and the other I called Unity, and I shepherded the flock. ^[The Hebrew term refers collectively to both sheep and goats (small livestock animals)]

###### v8
And I got rid of three shepherds in one month, for _I grew impatient_ ^[Literally "my soul became short"] with them, and _they also became tired of me_. ^[Literally "also their soul detested me"]

###### v9
So I said, "I will not shepherd you! The _one_ dying will die, and the _one_ to be destroyed will be destroyed. And the _ones_ remaining, let them devour _the flesh of each other_." ^[Literally "each the flesh of her neighbor"]

###### v10
And I took my staff Kindness and broke it, to break my covenant that I _had made_ ^[Literally "had cut"] with all the peoples.

###### v11
And it was broken on that day. Then the afflicted ^[LXX reads "merchants (of the flock)" which is reflected in some English translations] of the flock, ^[The Hebrew term refers collectively to both sheep and goats (small livestock animals)] the _ones who were_ watching me, knew that it _was_ the word of Yahweh.

###### v12
And I said to them, "If _it seems right to you_, ^[Literally "_it is_ good in your eyes"] give _me_ my wages, but if not, _keep them_." ^[Literally "refrain"] And they weighed out my wages, thirty silver _shekels_.

###### v13
And Yahweh said to me, "Throw it to the potter," ^[Syriac reads "treasury," followed by NAB, NRSV, TEV] _this noble price_ ^[Literally "the price of honor"] _at_ which I was valued by them!" So I took the thirty silver _shekels_ and I threw them to the potter ^[Syriac reads "treasury," followed by NAB, NRSV, TEV] _in_ the house of Yahweh.

###### v14
Then I broke my second staff Unity to break the family ties between Judah and Israel.

###### v15
And Yahweh said to me, "Take again the implements ^[Hebrew "implement"] of a foolish shepherd.

###### v16
For look, I _am_ raising up a shepherd in the land who will not attend to the _ones that are_ perishing; he will not seek the young man, ^[Syriac and other ancient versions read "the wandering" or "the scattered," as do several English translations] he will not heal the _ones that are_ crushed and he will not sustain the healthy _ones_; he will devour the flesh of the _fattened ones_ ^[Literally "the stall-fed"] and tear apart _even_ their hoofs.

###### v17
"Woe, my worthless shepherd
who deserts the flock! ^[The Hebrew term refers collectively to both sheep and goats (small livestock animals)]
_May_ a sword _fall_ on his arm
and on _his right eye_! ^[Literally "the eye of his right"]
May his arm wither completely
and _his right eye_ ^[Literally "the eye of his right"] be utterly blinded!"
