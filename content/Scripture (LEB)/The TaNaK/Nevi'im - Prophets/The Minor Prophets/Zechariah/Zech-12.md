###### v1
An oracle. The word of Yahweh concerning Israel. "_Thus declares_ ^[Literally "Declaration of"] Yahweh, who stretches out _the_ heavens, founds _the_ earth, and forms the spirit of humankind in its midst: ^[Or "forms the spirit of a man within him"]

###### v2
'Look, I _am_ going to make Jerusalem a cup of reeling for all the surrounding nations; it will also be against Judah in the siege against Jerusalem.

###### v3
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] on that day I will make Jerusalem a stone weight ^[Or "a heavy stone"] for all the peoples. All those lifting it up will grievously hurt themselves, and all the nations of the earth will assemble against it.

###### v4
On that day,' _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh, 'I will strike every horse with confusion, and the one riding it with madness; but over the house of Judah _I will keep my eyes open_, ^[Literally "I will open my eyes," that is, "I will be responsive" or "I will pay attention"] and I will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.

###### v5
And the clans of Judah will say _to themselves_, ^[Literally "in their heart"] "The inhabitants of Jerusalem are a strength to us, ^[Hebrew "me"] through Yahweh of hosts, their God."

###### v6
"'On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a pan of fire among _sticks of_ wood, and like a torch of fire among stalks ^[Hebrew "stalk"] of grain, and they will devour to _the_ right and to _the_ left all the surrounding peoples, and Jerusalem will be inhabited again _in_ its place, in Jerusalem.

###### v7
And Yahweh will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"] of Jerusalem may not be exalted over Judah.

###### v8
On that day Yahweh will put a shield around the inhabitants ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"] of Jerusalem, and the one who stumbles among them on that day will be like David, and the house of David _will be_ like God, like the angel of Yahweh, _before them_. ^[Literally "to the face of them"]

###### v9
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] on that day I will seek to destroy all the nations coming against Jerusalem.

###### v10
"'I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants ^[Hebrew "inhabitant"] of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication, and they will look to me whom they pierced, and they shall mourn over him, as one wails over an only child, and they will grieve bitterly over him as _one_ grieves bitterly over a firstborn.

###### v11
On that day the wailing will be great in Jerusalem, like the wailing for Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.

###### v12
And the land shall mourn, _each clan by itself_; ^[Literally "clans, clans alone"] the clan of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the clan of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;

###### v13
the clan of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the clan of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves;

###### v14
and all those clans remaining, _each clan by itself_, ^[Literally "clans, clans alone"] and their wives by themselves.'"
