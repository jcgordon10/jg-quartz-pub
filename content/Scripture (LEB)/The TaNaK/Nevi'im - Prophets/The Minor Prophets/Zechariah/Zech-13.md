###### v1
"'On that day a well will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, _to cleanse them from sin and from impurity_. ^[Literally "for sin and for impurity"]

###### v2
_And then_, ^[Literally "And it will happen"] on that day,' _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts, 'I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and also the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness I will banish from the land.

###### v3
_And then_, ^[Literally "And it will happen"] if anyone prophesies again, his father and his mother who bore him will say to him, "You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of Yahweh!" And his father and his mother who bore him will pierce him through when he prophesies.

###### v4
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] on that day, each of the prophets will be ashamed because of his vision when he was prophesying, and they will not put on a cloak of hair in order to deceive,

###### v5
but he will say, "I _am_ not a prophet; I am a tiller of the soil, for a man has acquired me since my youth." ^[Other translations read "for the land has been my possession since my youth"]

###### v6
And someone ^[Hebrew "he"] shall say to him, "What _are_ these wounds _between your arms_?" ^[Literally "between your hands"; that is, on the chest or on the back] and he will say, "Those I have received ^[Hebrew "have been struck"] _in_ the house of _the ones who_ love me."'"

###### v7
"O sword, awake against my shepherd,
against _the_ man _who is_ my associate,"
_declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh of hosts.
"Strike the shepherd,
so that the sheep ^[Or "flock"; the Hebrew term refers collectively to both sheep and goats (small livestock animals)] may be scattered,
and I will turn my hand against the small _ones_.

###### v8
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] in all the land," _declares_ ^[Literally "declaration of"] Yahweh,
"_two thirds_ ^[Literally "a mouth of two"] will be cut off and perish,
and one third will be left alive ^[Hebrew "left over"] in it.

###### v9
And I will bring the _remaining_ third into the fire,
and I will refine them like _one_ refines silver,
and I will test them like _one_ tests gold.
They ^[Hebrew "He"] will call my name,
and I will answer them. ^[Hebrew "him"]
I will say, 'They ^[Hebrew "He"] are my people,'
and they ^[Hebrew "he"] will say, 'Yahweh _is_ my God.'"
