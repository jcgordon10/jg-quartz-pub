###### v4
"And I will stretch out my hand against Judah

for the day of Yahweh draws near,

I will punish the officials
and the sons of the king

all who leap over the threshold,
who fill up the house of their master
_with_ violence and deceit.

###### v10
"And there shall be on that day"--a declaration of Yahweh--

and a wailing from the Second District,
and a loud ^[Or "great"] crashing from the hills.

###### v11
The inhabitants of the Mortar shall wail,
for all the traders have perished;
all who trade with silver have been cut off.

###### v12
And it shall be _that_ at that time
I will search Jerusalem with lamps,
and I will punish the men

who say in their hearts,
'Yahweh will not do good, nor will he do evil.'

###### v13
Then their wealth shall be as plunder,
and their homes as desolation.
And they shall build their houses and not inhabit them,
and they shall plant vineyards and not drink their wine."

The sound of the day of Yahweh _is_ bitterness;
there, a warrior cries out!

###### v15
That day _will be_ a day of wrath,
a day of trouble and distress,
a day of disaster and ruination,
a day of darkness and deep gloom,
a day of clouds ^[Hebrew "cloud"] and thick clouds, ^[Hebrew "cloud"]

###### v16
a day of trumpet and _trumpet_ blast
against the fortified cities
and against the high corner towers.

and they shall walk about like the blind,

their blood shall be poured out like dust
and their entrails like dung.

###### v18
Moreover, their silver and their gold
will not be able to save them
on the day of the wrath of Yahweh.
And in the fire of his zeal,
the whole land shall be consumed,
for a terrifying end he shall make
_for_ all the inhabitants of the land.
