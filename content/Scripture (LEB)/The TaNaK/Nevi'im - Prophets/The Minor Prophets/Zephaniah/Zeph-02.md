###### v1
Gather yourselves together! Now gather together,
O nation having no shame!

###### v2
Before the birth of the decree,
the day flies away like chaff;
before the fierce anger of Yahweh overtakes you;
before the day of the anger of Yahweh overtakes you.

###### v3
Seek Yahweh, all you afflicted of the land
who have fulfilled his law;
seek righteousness;
seek humility.
Perhaps you will be concealed
on the day of the anger of Yahweh.

###### v4
For Gaza will be abandoned,
and Ashkelon as a desolation.
_As for_ Ashdod, at noon they will drive her away,
and Ekron shall be uprooted.

###### v5
Woe _to you_, inhabitants of the region of the sea,
people of the Kerethites!
The word of Yahweh _is_ against you,
O Canaan, land of the Philistines.
I will destroy you _until there is no inhabitant_. ^[Literally "from there is not an inhabitant"]

###### v6
And you, O region of the sea, shall become
pastures _and_ meadows _for_ shepherds
and sheep pens _for the_ flocks.

###### v7
And it shall become a region
for the remnant of the house of Judah;
upon them they shall graze,
and in the houses of Ashkelon
they shall lie down in the evening.
For Yahweh their God shall be mindful of them,
and he will restore their fortunes.

###### v8
I have heard the reproaches of Moab
and the scorning of the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"]
_with_ which they have taunted my nation
and made boasts against their territory.

###### v9
"Therefore, as I live"--a declaration of Yahweh of hosts,
the God of Israel--
"Moab shall be as Sodom,
and the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] like Gomorrah,
a place of weeds and salt pits
and a desolation forever.
The remnant of my people shall plunder them,
and the remainder of my nation shall possess them."

###### v10
This _shall be_ for them in place of their pride
because they mocked and boasted
against the people of Yahweh of hosts.

###### v11
Yahweh _will be_ awesome against them,
for he will destroy all the gods of the earth
and all the lands ^[Or "islands"] of the nations;
each in its place will bow down to him.

###### v12
You also, O Cushites,
they shall be killed by my sword.

###### v13
And he will stretch out his hand against the north,
and he will destroy Assyria
and will make Nineveh a desolation,
a dry wasteland like the desert.

###### v14
Herds shall lie down in her midst,
every wild animal of a nation;
even the desert owl and the screech owl
shall lodge on her capitals.
A voice shall hoot in the window;
rubble ^[The traditional Hebrew text has "waste," while LXX has "a raven," reflecting a different word with one consonant changed] on the threshold;
for the cedar _is_ laid bare.

###### v15
This _is_ the city of rejoicing
that lived securely;
the one saying in her heart,
"_I am, and there is none besides me_." ^[Literally "I _am_ and none me"]
How she has become a desolation,
a lair for wild animals!
Everyone who passes by her hisses and shakes his fist.
