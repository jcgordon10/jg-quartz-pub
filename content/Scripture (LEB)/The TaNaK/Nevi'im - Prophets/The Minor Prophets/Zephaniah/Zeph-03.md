[[Zeph-02|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
Woe _to you_, O rebellious and defiled one!
The oppressing city!

###### v2
She listens to no voice;
she does not accept correction.
In Yahweh she does not trust;
to her God she does not draw near.

###### v3
Her officials in her midst _are_ roaring lions;
her judges _are_ evening wolves;
they leave nothing until the morning.

###### v4
Her prophets _are_ arrogant men of treachery;
her priests have defiled _that which is_ holy;
they do violence to _the_ law.

###### v5
Yahweh _is_ righteous in her midst;
he does not do wickedness.
_Morning by morning_ ^[Literally "In the morning, in the morning"] he renders his judgment;
at dawn he does not fail,
but an evil one knows no shame.

###### v6
"I have cut off nations;
their strongholds are deserted.
I have laid waste their streets,
so that none pass through.
Their cities have been destroyed
_and are_ without a man, without an inhabitant.

###### v7
I have said, 'Surely she will fear me;
she will accept discipline.
Then her dwelling place will not be cut down,
_nor_ all that I have brought upon her.'
Surely they rise early;
they make all their deeds corrupt.

###### v8
"Therefore, wait for me"--a declaration of Yahweh--
"for the day of my rising as a witness.
For my decision _is_ to gather nations,
to assemble ^[The traditional Hebrew has "assemble me"; this translation follows LXX] kingdoms,
to pour out my wrath upon them, all my burning anger.
For by the fire of my anger all the land shall be consumed.

###### v9
Because then I will _make the speech of the nations pure_; ^[Literally "I will turn to the nations a purged lip"]
that all of them might call on the name of Yahweh,
to serve him _in unison_. ^[Literally "with one shoulder"]

###### v10
From beyond the rivers of Cush
my worshipers and the daughter of my scattered ones
shall bring my offering.

###### v11
On that day you shall not be humiliated
on account of all your deeds
_by_ which you have rebelled against me.
For then I shall remove from your midst
those exulting in your pride,
and you shall no longer be haughty
in _my holy mountain_. ^[Literally "the mountain of my holiness"]

###### v12
And I will leave in your midst
a people afflicted and poor,
and they shall take refuge
in the name of Yahweh.

###### v13
The remnant of Israel
shall not do wickedness;
they shall not speak deception,
nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth.
For they shall graze and lie down,
and none shall frighten _them_."

###### v14
Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion!
Cry aloud, O Israel!
Rejoice and be jubilant with all your heart,
O daughter of Jerusalem!

###### v15
Yahweh has annulled your judgments;
he has turned away your enemies.
The king of Israel, Yahweh, _is_ in your midst;
you shall no longer fear misfortune.

###### v16
On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem,
"Fear not, O Zion;
your hands shall not hang limp.

###### v17
Yahweh your God _is_ in your midst;
a mighty warrior who saves.
He shall rejoice over you with joy;
he renews ^[The translation follows the LXX text; the traditional Hebrew text reads "he will silence you in his love"] you in his love;
he will exult over you with singing.

###### v18
I will gather those of you grieving on account of the feast;
they were raising against her a reproach.

###### v19
Behold, at that time I will deal with all your oppressors;
I will save the lame and gather the outcast.
I will change ^[Or "make"] them from shame
to glory and _renown_ ^[Literally "a name"] throughout the whole world.

###### v20
At that time I will bring you _in_;
at the time of my gathering you _together_.
For I will make you _renowned_ ^[Literally "a name"] and praised
among all the nations of the earth
when I restore your fortunes before your eyes,"
says Yahweh.
