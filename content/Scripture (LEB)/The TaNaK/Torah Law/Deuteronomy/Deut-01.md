These _are_ the words that Moses spoke to all _of_ Israel _on the other side of_ ^[Literally "in the beyond _of_"] the Jordan in the desert, ^[Or "the wilderness"] in the desert plateau ^[Or "desert plain"; others render this as a named location, "Arabah"] opposite Suph, between Paran and between Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab.

###### v2
It is _a journey of_ _eleven days_ ^[Literally "one and ten days"] from Herob _by the way of Mount Seir_ ^[Literally "by the mountain of Seir"] up to Kadesh Barnea.

###### v3
_And it was_ ^[Literally "and it happened" or "and then"] in the fortieth year, on the eleventh month, on _the_ first _day_ of the month, Moses spoke to the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] according to all that Yahweh had instructed him _to speak_ to them.

###### v4
_This happened_ _after defeating_ ^[Literally "after he had struck down"] Sihon king of the Amorites, who _was_ reigning ^[Or "dwelling," and in this context "reigning"] in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who _was_ reigning ^[Or "dwelling," and in this context "reigning"] in Ashtaroth in Edrei.

###### v5
On the other side of  ^[Literally "in the beyond _of_"] the Jordan in the land of Moab Moses began to explain this law, ^[Hebrew _torah_] _saying_: ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v6
"Yahweh our God spoke to us at Horeb, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'You have stayed _long enough_ ^[Literally "much _time_"] at this mountain.

###### v7
Turn _now_ and _move on_, ^[Literally "journey on with respect to yourselves" or "move yourselves out"] and go _into_ the hill of the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] and to all _of_ the neighboring regions ^[Or "peoples"] in the Jordan _Valley_ ^[Literally "Arabah," arid stretches of land.] in the hill country and in the Negev and in the coastal area along the sea, _into_ the land of the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] and _into_ the Lebanon, as far as the great river Euphrates.

###### v8
Look, I have set the land _before you_; ^[Literally "before your face"] go and take possession of the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give _it_ to them and to their offspring after them.'

###### v9
"And I spoke to them at that time, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'I am not able to bear you alone.

###### v10
Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and look; you _are_ today as the stars of the heaven _in number_. ^[Literally "with respect to multitude/abundance"]

###### v11
Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] may he add to you as you are _now_ a thousand times, and may he bless you just as he _promised you_. ^[Literally "spoke to you"]

###### v12
How can I bear you _by myself_, ^[Literally "to me alone"] your burden and your load and your strife?

###### v13
Choose for yourselves _wise and discerning and knowledgeable men_ ^[Literally "men wise and discerning and knowledgeable"] for _each of_ your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.'

###### v14
"And you answered me, and you said, 'The thing you have said to do is good.'

###### v15
And so I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and _then_ I appointed them as leaders over you _as_ commanders of _groups of_ thousands and commanders of _groups of_ hundreds and commanders of _groups of_ fifties and commanders of _groups of_ tens _as_ officials for your tribes.

###### v16
And at that time I instructed your judges, saying, '_hear out your fellow men_, ^[Literally "hear between your brothers," with the idea of listening carefully in this context] and _then_ judge fairly ^[Or "righteously"] between a man and between his brother and between _his opponent who is a resident alien_. ^[Literally "between his resident alien/non-Israelite who dwells temporarily among Israel"]

###### v17
You must not _be partial_ ^[Literally "recognize faces"] _in your judgment_;  ^[Literally "in the process of rendering a judgment"] hear _out_ the small _person_ as _also_ the great _person_; _do not be intimidated by any person_, ^[Literally "do not fear before the faces of _any_ man"] because the judgment _is_ God's; and the case that is too difficult ^[Or "hard"] for you, bring _it_ to me, and I will hear it _out_.'

###### v18
And so I instructed you at that time _concerning_ all _of_ the things that you should do.

###### v19
"Then we set out from Horeb, and we went _through_ the whole _of_ that great and terrible desert that you saw _on_ the way _to_ the hill country of the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] as Yahweh our God had commanded us, and _so_ we came up to Kadesh Barnea.

###### v20
I said to you, '_You have reached_ ^[Literally "You have come up to"] the hill country of the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] that Yahweh our God _is_ giving to us.

###### v21
See, Yahweh your God has set before you the land; go up and possess _it_ as Yahweh the God of your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] said to you; do not fear and do not be dismayed.'

###### v22
"Then all of you approached me, and _you_ said, 'Let us send men _before us_, ^[Literally "before our faces" or "ahead of us"] and let them explore the land for us, and let them bring back _a report_ ^[Literally "a word"] to us _concerning_ the way that _we should take_ ^[Literally "we should go up by it"] _and concerning_ the cities that we shall come to.'

###### v23
The plan was good _in my opinion_, ^[Literally "in my eyes"] and _so_ I took from _among_ you twelve men, _one from each tribe_. ^[Literally "man one from the tribe"]

###### v24
And they _set out_ ^[Literally "turned"] and _went up into the hill country_, ^[Literally "went up toward the hill _country_ mountain"] and they went up to the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Eschol, and they spied out _the land_.

###### v25
They took in their hands ^[Hebrew "hand"] _some of the fruit_ ^[Literally "from the fruit"] of the land, and they brought _it_ down to us, and they brought to us back _a report_, ^[Literally "a word"] and they said, 'The land that Yahweh our God _is_ giving to us _is_ good.'

###### v26
But you were not willing to go up, and you rebelled against the _command_ ^[Literally "mouth"] of Yahweh your God.

###### v27
And you grumbled in your tents, and you said, 'Because of the hatred of Yahweh _toward_ us he has brought us out from the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] to destroy us.

###### v28
Where _can_ we go up? Our brothers have _made our hearts melt_, ^[Literally "caused to melt our hearts"] _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "The people are greater ^[Or "bigger"] and taller than we are, ^[Hebrew "than us"] _and there are_ great fortified cities _reaching_ up to heaven, and we saw the sons of the Anakites _living_ there."'

###### v29
"And so I said to you, 'Do not be terrified, and do not fear them.

###### v30
Yahweh your God, who is going _before you_, ^[Literally "to your faces"] will himself ^[The Hebrew pronoun indicates emphasis] fight for you, _just as_ ^[Literally "like all that"] he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,

###### v31
and _just as he did_ in the wilderness ^[Or "desert"] when ^[Or "where"] you saw that ^[Or "how"] Yahweh your God carried you, just as someone ^[Or "a man"] carries his son, all _along_ the way _that_ you traveled until _you reached_ ^[Literally "you came"] this place.'

###### v32
But through all of this you did not trust in Yahweh your God,

###### v33
_who goes_ ^[Literally "_is_ the one going"] _before you_ ^[Literally "before your faces"] on your ^[Hebrew "the"] way, seeking a place for your encampment, in fire at night and in a cloud by day, to show you the way that _you should go_. ^[Literally "you should go in it"]

###### v34
"Then Yahweh heard the sound of your words, and he was angry, and he swore, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v35
'No one of these men ^[The beginning of an oath in Hebrew; the text emphatically denies anyone of that evil generation the privilege of seeing the promised land] of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v36
except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh; he himself ^[Emphatic use of the pronoun] shall see it, and to him I will give the land upon which he has trodden and to his sons ^[Or "descendants"] because _he followed Yahweh unreservedly_.' ^[Literally "he filled _his hands_ after Yahweh"]

###### v37
Even with me Yahweh was angry because of you, saying, 'Not even you shall enter there.

###### v38
Joshua, the son of Nun, _your assistant_, ^[Literally "the one standing before you"] will go there; encourage him because he will cause Israel to inherit it.

###### v39
And your little children, who you thought shall become plunder, and your sons, who do not today know good or bad, shall themselves ^[The Hebrew pronoun is used for emphasis] go there, and I will give it to them, and they shall take possession of it.

###### v40
But you turn and set out _in the direction of_ the wilderness by way of the _Red Sea_.' ^[Literally "sea of reeds"]

###### v41
"You replied and said to me, 'We have sinned against Yahweh, _and now_ we will go up and fight according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us'; and _so_ each man fastened on _his battle gear_, ^[Literally "his vessels of battle"] and you regarded _it_ as easy to go up _into_ the hill country.

###### v42
So Yahweh said to me, 'Say to them, "You shall not go up, and you shall not fight because I am not in your midst; you will be defeated _before_ ^[Literally "in the faces of your enemies"] your enemies."'

###### v43
So I spoke to you, but you did not listen; you rebelled against the _command of Yahweh_; ^[Literally "mouth of Yahweh"] you behaved presumptuously, and you went up into the hill country.

###### v44
The Amorites living in the hill country went out _to oppose you_ ^[Literally "to meet you"] and chased you as _a swarm of_ wild honey bees do; and _so_ they _beat_ ^[Literally "cut"] you down in Seir as far as Hormah.

###### v45
So you returned and wept _before Yahweh_; ^[Literally "before the faces of Yahweh"] but Yahweh did not listen to your voice and did not pay _any_ attention to you.

###### v46
You stayed in Kadesh many days; such were the days that you stayed _there_.
