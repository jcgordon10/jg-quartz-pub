###### v1
"_Then_ we turned and set out _toward_ the wilderness ^[Or "desert"] in the direction of the _Red Sea_, ^[Literally "sea of reeds"] as Yahweh told me, and we went around Mount Seir _for_ many days.

###### v2
Yahweh spoke to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v3
'_Long_ enough you have been skirting this mountain; turn yourselves north,

###### v4
and instruct ^[Or "command"] the people, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "You _are_ about to cross _through_ the territory of your brothers, the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Esau, who are living in Seir; they will be afraid of you, and _so_ be very careful.

###### v5
Do not get involved in battle ^[Or "provoke"] with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even _a foot's breadth_ ^[Literally "a sole's foot of space"] _of it_; since I have given Mount Seir _as_ a possession for Esau.

###### v6
You shall buy food from them so that you may eat; and also you shall purchase water from them with money so that you may drink.

###### v7
The fact of the matter is, Yahweh your God has blessed you in _all the work you have done_; ^[Literally "the work of your hand"] he knows _your travels_ ^[Literally "your journeying"] _with respect to_ this great wilderness; forty years Yahweh your God _has been_ with you; you have not lacked a thing."'

###### v8
And so we passed by our brothers, the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Esau, who live in Seir, past the road of the Arabah, ^[Or "Jordan Valley" since the Arabah is an extension of it] from Elath and Ezion Geber, and we turned and traveled along the route of the desert ^[Or "wilderness"] of Moab.

###### v9
And Yahweh said to me, 'You shall not attack Moab, and you shall not engage in war ^[Or "battle"] with them, for I will not give you any of his land _as_ a possession; I have given Ar to the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Lot _as_ a possession.'

###### v10
(The Emim previously lived in it, a people large, ^[Or "great" in the sense of influential] numerous, and tall, like the Anakites.

###### v11
They were reckoned also _as_ Rephaim as the Anakites _were_; but the Moabites called them Emim.

###### v12
The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them _from among themselves_, ^[Literally "from their presence"] as Israel did with respect to the land of their ^[Literally "its/his"] possession that Yahweh gave to them.)

###### v13
So _now_ arise and cross over the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Zered yourselves; and _so_ we crossed the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Zered.

###### v14
Now the _length of time_ ^[Literally "days"] that we had traveled from Kadesh Barnea until _the time when_ we crossed the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Zered _was_ thirty-eight years, until the perishing of all of that generation; _that is_, the men of war from the midst of the camp as Yahweh had sworn to them.

###### v15
The hand of Yahweh was against them to root them out from the midst of the camp until they perished completely.

###### v16
"_And then_ ^[Literally "And it happened"] when all the men of war ^[Or "battle"] _had died_ ^[Literally "had finished/completed to die"] from among the people,

###### v17
Yahweh spoke to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v18
'You _are_ about to cross over the boundary of Moab _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] at Ar.

###### v19
When you approach _the border of_ ^[Literally "opposite"] the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "the sons/children of Ammon"] you shall not harass them, and you shall not get involved in battle with them, for I have not given the land of _the Ammonites_ ^[Literally "the sons/children of Ammon"] to you as a possession; because I have given it to the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Lot _as_ a possession.

###### v20
(It is also considered the land of Rephaim; Rephaim lived in it _previously_, ^[Literally "before"] and the Ammonites called them Zamzummim,

###### v21
a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakites; Yahweh destroyed them from before them, ^[That is, the Ammonites] and they dispossessed them and settled in place of them,

###### v22
just as he did for the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from _before them_ ^[Literally "from the face/presence of them"] and dispossessed them, and _then_ they settled in their ^[Hebrew "them"] place up to this day.

###### v23
And _also_ the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, _and the_ Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and _then_ settled in their place.

###### v24
Arise, ^[Or "Get up"] set out and cross _over_ the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, the king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession of _it_, and engage with him in battle.

###### v25
This day I will begin to place _the dread of you_ ^[Literally "your dread"] and the fear of you _before_ ^[Literally "upon the faces of"] the peoples under all the heavens. _They_ will hear _the report about you_, ^[Literally "your report"] and _so_ they will shake and tremble _because of you_.'  ^[Literally "from before you"]

###### v26
"So I sent messengers from the wilderness ^[Or "desert"] of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon; _I sent_ terms of peace, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v27
'Let me cross through your land _and_ _only along the road_ ^[Literally "in the road, in the road"] I will go; I will not turn aside to the right or _to the_ left.

###### v28
Food for money you shall sell me, so that I may eat, and water for money you will give to me, so that I may drink; just let me cross on foot.

###### v29
_Just as_ the descendants ^[Or "the children/sons of"] of Esau did for me, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, until I cross the Jordan into the land that Yahweh our God is giving to us.'

###### v30
But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us cross through his _territory_ because Yahweh your God hardened his spirit and _made him obstinate_ ^[Literally "made firm his heart"] _in order to give him_ ^[Literally "to give him," indicating purpose] into your hand, _just as he has now done_. ^[Literally "as _it is_ this day"]

###### v31
Yahweh said to me, 'Look! I have begun to give _over to you_ ^[Literally "to the face of you"] Sihon and his land; begin _to take possession of his land_.' ^[Literally, "take possession in order to possess his land"]

###### v32
Then Sihon and all his people came out to meet us for battle at Jahaz.

###### v33
And so Yahweh our God gave him over _to us_, ^[Literally "before us"] and we struck him down, and his sons ^[Or "descendants"] and all of his people.

###### v34
So we captured all of his cities at that time, and we destroyed each town _of_ males and the women and the children; we did not leave behind a survivor.

###### v35
We took only the livestock as spoil for ourselves, ^[Hebrew "us"] and _also_ the booty of the cities that we had captured.

###### v36
From Aroer, which _is_ on the edge of the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Arnon and the city that _was_ in the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] on up to Gilead, _there_ was not a city that was inaccessible to us; Yahweh our God gave _everything_ ^[Literally "the whole"] _to us_. ^[Literally "before us"]

###### v37
Only the land of _the Ammonites_ ^[Literally "children/sons of Ammon"] you did not approach, _all along_ the whole upper region of the Jabbok _River_ ^[Literally "wadi," which here refers to a flowing river] and the towns of the hill country, _according to all_ that Yahweh our God had instructed.
