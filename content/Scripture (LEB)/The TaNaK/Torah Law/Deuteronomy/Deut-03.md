###### v1
"Then we turned, and we went up the road to Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us, he and all _of_ his army for the battle _at_ Edrei.

###### v2
And Yahweh said to me, 'You should not fear him, for I have given him and all _of_ his army ^[Or "people"] and his land into your hand. And _so_ you will do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] who _was_ reigning in Heshbon.'

###### v3
And _so_ Yahweh our God also gave Og the king of Bashan, and all of his army ^[Or "people"] into our hand, and we struck him down until not a survivor remained to ^[Or "for"] him.

###### v4
And we captured all _of_ his towns ^[Or "villages/cities _small_"] at that time; _there_ was not a city that we did not take from them.

###### v5
All of these _were_ fortified towns with high walls, gates, and bars, ^[Hebrew "bar"] _apart from_ ^[Literally "alone from"] very many _of_ the villages of the open country.

###### v6
And _so_ we destroyed them just as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon; _we destroyed_ utterly each town of males, the women, and the little children.

###### v7
But all _of_ the livestock and the booty of the towns we kept as spoil for ourselves. ^[Hebrew "us"]

###### v8
"And so we took at that time the land from _the control of_ ^[Literally "the hand of"] _the_ two kings of the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] who _were_ _on the other side of the Jordan_, ^[Literally "in the beyond of the Jordan"] from the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Arnon up to _Mount Hermon_. ^[Literally "the mountain of Hermon"]

###### v9
(The Sidonians called Hermon 'Sirion,' and the Amorites called it 'Senir.')

###### v10
All of the towns of the plateau and the whole of Gilead and all of Bashan up to Salecah and Edrei, the towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

###### v11
(For only Og, king of Bashan, was left from the remnant of the Rephaim. Indeed, his bedstead--it _was_ a bedstead of iron. It is in Rabbah of the _Ammonites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] Nine cubits _is_ its length, and four cubits _is_ its width according to the cubit of a man.)

###### v12
And _so_ we took possession of this land at that time, from Aroer, which _is_ on the _edge of the_ wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Arnon, and _also_ half of the hill country of Gilead and its towns I gave to the Reubenites ^[Hebrew "Reubenite"] and to the Gadites. ^[Hebrew "Gadite"]

###### v13
And the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the whole region of Argo. All of that _area of_ Bashan was called _the_ land of the Rephaim.

###### v14
Jair the descendant ^[Or "son"] of Manasseh acquired the whole region of Argob, up to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he called it, ^[Hebrew "them"] _that is_ Bashan, after his _own_ name, Havvoth Jair, _as it still is today_. ^[Literally "up to this day"]

###### v15
And _also_ I gave Gilead to Makir.

###### v16
And to the Reubenites ^[Hebrew "Reubenite"] and to the Gadites ^[Hebrew "Gadite"] I gave, from Gilead up to the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Arnon, the middle of the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] _as a_ boundary and up to the Jabbok _River_, ^[Literally "wadi," which here refers to a flowing river] the boundary of the _Ammonites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"]

###### v17
And the _Jordan Valley_ ^[Literally "Arabah"] _with_ the Jordan _River as its_ boundary, from Kinnereth ^[Or "Chinnereth," the Sea of Galilee] up to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, ^[Or the Dead Sea] _with_ the slopes of Pisgah toward the east.

###### v18
"And I charged you _all_ at that time _when I_ said, "Yahweh has given you--to _all of_ you--this land to possess. All the _warriors_ ^[Literally "men of valor"] shall cross over, ready to fight, before your brothers, the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v19
Only your wives and your little children and your livestock (I know that _you have much livestock_) ^[Literally "livestock much _there is_ to you"] must stay in your towns that I have given you,

###### v20
until Yahweh shall give rest to your brothers as _he did_ to you, and also they take possession _of_ the land that Yahweh your God _is_ giving to them beyond the Jordan; then they may return, each _one_ to his possession that I have given to them.

###### v21
And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, 'Your eyes see all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings; so Yahweh will do to all _of_ the kingdoms where you are about to cross over to.

###### v22
You shall not fear them, for Yahweh your God is the _one_ fighting for you.

###### v23
"And I pleaded with Yahweh at that time, saying,

###### v24
'Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand, for what ^[Hebrew "who"] god _is there_ in the heaven or on the earth who can do according to your works and according to your mighty deeds?

###### v25
Let me cross over, please, and let me see the good land _that is beyond the Jordan_, ^[Literally "in the beyond of the Jordan"] this good hill country and Lebanon.'

###### v26
But Yahweh was very angry with me because of you, and he would not listen to me, and Yahweh said, '_Enough of that from you_! ^[Literally "Much to you"] You shall not speak to me _any_ longer about this matter!

###### v27
Go up _to_ the top of Pisgah and _look around you_ ^[Literally "lift up your eyes"] toward the west, toward the north, and toward the east, and _view_ ^[Literally "look"] _the land_ with your eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan.

###### v28
Now instruct Joshua and support him and encourage him because he himself ^[Emphatic use of the pronoun] will cross _over_ before this people and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.'

###### v29
So we remained in the valley opposite Beth Peor.
