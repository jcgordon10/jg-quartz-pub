###### v1
"Now, Israel, listen to the rules and to the regulations that I _am_ teaching you to do, in order that you may live and you may go _in_ and you may take possession of the land that Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] _is_ giving to you.

###### v2
You must not add to the word that I _am_ commanding you, and you shall not take away from it _in order_ to keep ^[Or "observe"] the commands of Yahweh your God that I _am_ commanding you _to observe_.

###### v3
Your eyes have seen ^[Literally "your eyes the seeing what"] what Yahweh did with ^[Or "in"] _the case of_ Baal Peor, for _each_ ^[Literally "every one _of_"] man that followed after Baal Peor Yahweh your God destroyed from your midst.

###### v4
But you, the _ones_ holding fast to Yahweh your God, _are_ all alive _today_. ^[Literally "the day"]

###### v5
See, I now teach ^[Or "I have taught" (compare NASB, NEB)] you rules and regulations _just_ as Yahweh my God has commanded me, to observe _them_ _just_ so in the midst of the land where you _are_ going, to take possession of it.

###### v6
And _you must observe them diligently_, ^[Literally "you must observe and you must do"] for that _is_ your wisdom and your insight before the eyes of the people, who will hear all _of_ these rules, and they will say, 'Surely this great nation _is_ a wise and discerning people.'

###### v7
For what great nation _has_ for it a god near to it as Yahweh our God, whenever ^[Literally "in every matter/every time we call "] we call _upon_ him?

###### v8
And what _other_ great nation has for it ^[Literally "which/that _is_ for him _it_"] just rules and regulations just like ^[Literally "as"] _this whole_ ^[Literally "all _of_"] law that I _am_ setting _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] you _today_? ^[Literally "the day"]

###### v9
"However, _take care_ ^[Literally "watch"] for yourself and watch your inner self ^[Or "soul"] closely, so that you do not forget the things that your eyes have seen, so that they do not slip from your mind all the days of your life; and you shall make them known to your children and to _your grandchildren_. ^[Literally "the children of your children"]

###### v10
_Remember_ the day that you stood _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] Yahweh your God at Horeb _when Yahweh said to me_, ^[Literally "when to say Yahweh"] 'Summon for me the people so that I can tell them my words, that they may learn to fear me all _of_ the days they _are_ alive on the earth and so _that_ they may teach their children.'

###### v11
And _so_ you came near, and you stood under the mountain, and the mountain _was_ burning with fire up to the heart of the heaven, _dark with a very thick cloud_. ^[Literally "darkness, cloud, and very thick darkness"]

###### v12
And Yahweh spoke to you from the midst of the fire; _you heard_ ^[Literally "you _were_ hearing"] a sound of words, but _you did not see_ ^[Literally "you were not seeing"] a form--only a voice.

###### v13
And he declared to you his covenant, _the Ten Commandments_, ^[Literally "the ten words"] which he charged you _to observe_, ^[Literally "to do"] and he wrote them on _the_ two tablets of stone.

###### v14
And Yahweh charged me at that time to teach you rules and regulations _for your observation of them_ ^[Literally "for your doing them"] in the land that you _are_ _about to cross into_ ^[Literally "about to cross into there"] to take possession of it.

###### v15
"So _you must be very careful for yourselves_, ^[Literally "watch yourselves diligently with respect to your souls"] because you did not see ^[Or "have not seen"] any form on the day Yahweh spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire,

###### v16
so that you _do_ not _ruin yourselves_ ^[Literally "corrupt yourselves"] and make for yourselves a divine image _in_ a form of any image, a replica of male or female,

###### v17
a replica of any animal that _is_ upon the earth, a replica of any winged bird that flies in the air,

###### v18
a replica of any creeping thing on the ground, a replica of any fish that _is_ in the water _below_ ^[Literally "under"] the earth.

###### v19
_And do this so that you do not lift_ ^[Literally "And lest you lift up"] your eyes _toward_ heaven and _observe_ ^[Literally "see"] the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of the heaven, and be led astray and bow down to them and serve them, things that Yahweh your God has allotted to all _of_ the peoples under all _of_ the heaven.

###### v20
But Yahweh has taken you and brought you out from the furnace of iron, from Egypt, to be a people of inheritance to ^[Or "for"; a people of inheritance = a people who is his very own possession] him, _as it is this day_. ^[Literally "as the day the this" = as you are now]

###### v21
"And Yahweh was angry with me _because of you_, ^[Literally "because of your matter"] and he swore _that I would not cross the Jordan_ ^[Literally "not I to cross the Jordan"] and _that I would not go to the good land_ ^[Literally "not _I_ going to the land"] that Yahweh your God is giving you as an inheritance.

###### v22
For I _am_ going to die in this land; I am not going to cross the Jordan, but you _are_ going to cross, and you are going to take possession of this good land.

###### v23
Watch _out_ for yourselves so that you do not forget the covenant of Yahweh your God that he had _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] with you and make for yourselves a divine image _of_ the form of anything that Yahweh your God _has forbidden_, ^[Literally "has commanded you _about_"]

###### v24
for Yahweh your God _is_ a devouring fire, a jealous ^[Or "zealous" or "impassioned"] God.

###### v25
"When you have had children and _grandchildren_ ^[Literally "children of children"] and you have grown old in the land and you act corruptly and you make a divine image _of_ the form of anything and you do evil in the eyes of Yahweh your God, _thus_ provoking him to anger,

###### v26
I call ^[Or "I shall call to witness"] to witness against you today the heaven and the earth, that you will perish soon and completely from the land that you _are_ crossing the Jordan into it to take possession of it; _you will not live long on it_, ^[Literally "you will not extend days"] but you will be completely destroyed.

###### v27
And Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left _few in number_ ^[Literally "people of number," as opposed to people without number] among the nations _to where Yahweh will lead you_. ^[Literally "_he_ will lead Yahweh you there"]

###### v28
And you will there serve gods _made by human hands_, ^[Literally "the work of the hands of human"] _of_ wood and stone, _gods_ that cannot see and cannot hear and cannot eat and cannot smell.

###### v29
But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God and will find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul. ^[Or "inner self"]

###### v30
_In your distress_ ^[Literally "In _the_ distress for you"] when ^[Hebrew "and"] all these things have found you in the _latter days_, ^[Literally "in the last of the days"] then ^[Hebrew "and"] you will return to Yahweh your God, and you will listen to his voice.

###### v31
For Yahweh your God is a compassionate God; he _will not abandon you_, ^[Literally "will not leave you alone"] and he will not destroy you, and he will not forget the covenant of your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] that he swore to them.

###### v32
"Yes, ask, please, about former days that _preceded you_ ^[Literally "that _they_ were to the face of you"] from the day that God created humankind on the earth; _ask even_ from _one_ end of the heaven up to the _other_ end of heaven _whether anything ever happened_ ^[Literally "was it _ever_"] like this great thing or _whether anything like it was ever heard_. ^[Literally "was it _ever_ heard as it"]

###### v33
Has a people _ever_ heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, _just_ as you heard _it_, and lived?

###### v34
Or has a god _ever_ attempted to go to take for himself ^[Hebrew "for him"] a nation from the midst of a nation, _using_ trials and signs and wonders and war, with an outstretched arm and with great and awesome deeds, like all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

###### v35
You _yourselves_ ^[Emphatic use of pronoun; plural meaning implied] were shown _this wonder_ in order _for you_ to acknowledge that Yahweh _is_ the God; ^[The definite article indicates that Israel's God is alone the true God and the one who revealed himself to them] there is no other _God_ _besides him_. ^[Literally "except him" or "to him alone"]

###### v36
From heaven he made you hear his voice to teach you, and on the earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from the midst of the fire.

###### v37
And because he loved your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] he chose their _descendants_ ^[Literally "seed"] after them. And he brought you forth from Egypt _with his own presence_, ^[Literally "with his faces"] by his great strength,

###### v38
to drive out nations greater and more numerous than you _from before you_, ^[Literally "from your face"] to bring you _and_ to give to you their land _as_ an inheritance, as _it is_ this day.

###### v39
So you shall acknowledge _today_, ^[Literally "the day"] and _you must call to mind_ ^[Literally "you shall bring back to your heart"] that Yahweh _is_ God in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no other _God_.

###### v40
And you shall keep his rules and his commandments that I am commanding you _today_, ^[Literally "the day"] _so_ that _it may go well_ ^[Literally "he/it is good"] for you and for your children ^[Or "descendants"] after you, and so that _you may remain a long time_ ^[Literally "you may make long/prolong days"] on the land that Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you _during_ all _of_ those days."

###### v41
Then Moses set apart three cities _on the other side of the Jordan_, ^[Literally "_in the_ beyond _of_ the Jordan"] _toward the east_, ^[Literally "toward rising of the sun"]

###### v42
_in order for_ _a manslayer_ ^[Literally "a killer of a man"] to flee there _who_ has killed his neighbor _without intent_ ^[Literally "without _previous_ knowledge"] and was not hating him _previously_, ^[Literally "_the_ day before yesterday"] and _so_ he could flee to one of these cities _and be safe_. ^[Literally "and live"]

###### v43
_He set apart_ Bezer in the wilderness ^[Or "desert"] in the land of the plateau of the Reubenites; ^[Hebrew "Reubenite"] Ramoth in Gilead of the Gadites, ^[Hebrew "Gadite"] and Golan in Bashan of the Manassites. ^[Hebrew "Manassite"]

###### v44
Now this _is_ the law ^[Hebrew "the _torah_" = teaching, instruction, law] that Moses set _before_ ^[Literally "before the faces of"] the _Israelites_; ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v45
these are the legal provisions and the rules and the regulations that Moses spoke to the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] _when they left Egypt_, ^[Literally "at their going out from Egypt"]

###### v47
And _so_ they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] who _were_ beyond the Jordan, _eastward_, ^[Literally "toward the rising of the sun"]

###### v48
from Aroer, which _is_ on the bank of the wadi ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season] of Arnon and as far as Mount Sirion; that _is_, Hermon,

###### v49
and all _of_ the Arabah ^[Or "valley" in this instance] beyond the Jordan, eastward, and as far as the Sea of the Arabah ^[Commonly known today as the Dead Sea] under the slopes of Pisgah.
