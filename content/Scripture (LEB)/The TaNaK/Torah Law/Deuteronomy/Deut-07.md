###### v1
"When Yahweh your God brings you into the land that you _are_ about to enter _into it_ ^[Literally "there"] to take possession of it, and he drives ^[Or "he will drive out"] out many nations _before you_, ^[Literally "from your faces"] the Hittites ^[Hebrew "Hittite"] and the Girgashites ^[Hebrew "Girgashite"] and the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] and the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] and the Hivites ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] and the Jebusites, ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"] seven nations mightier and more numerous than you,

###### v2
and Yahweh your God will give them _over to you_ ^[Literally "to your faces" or "before you"] and you defeat them, you must _utterly destroy them_; ^[Literally "set them aside for destruction"] you shall not make a covenant with them, and you shall not show mercy _to them_.

###### v3
And you shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughter to their son; and you shall not take his daughter for your son. ^[Grammatically singular pronominal suffixes here can also be rendered "their"]

###### v4
For their ^[Or "his"] sons and daughters will cause your son ^[Or "sons"] to turn away _from following me_, ^[Literally from "behind/after me"] and _so_ they will serve other gods, and _the anger of Yahweh would be kindled_ ^[Literally "and _it_ would become hot the nose of Yahweh"] against you, and he would quickly destroy you.

###### v5
But this is what you must do to them: you shall break down their altars, and their stone pillars you shall smash, and their Asherah poles you shall hew down, and you shall burn their idols with fire.

###### v6
For you _are_ a holy people for Yahweh your God; Yahweh your God has chosen you to be for him a people, a treasured possession from _among_ all the peoples that _are_ on the face ^[Or "surface"] of the earth.

###### v7
"Yahweh loved you and chose you not _because of your great number_ ^[Literally "from your multitude/abundance"] exceeding all _other_ peoples, for you _are_ fewer than all of the peoples,

###### v8
but ^[Or "for"] _because of_ ^[Literally "from"] the love of Yahweh _for_ you and because of his keeping _of_ the sworn oath that he swore to your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] Yahweh brought you _out_ with a strong hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.

###### v9
_So_ know that Yahweh your God, he _is_ God, the trustworthy God, maintaining his ^[Hebrew "the"] covenant and his ^[Hebrew "the"] loyal love with those who love him and with those who keep his commandments to a thousand generations, ^[Hebrew "generation"]

###### v10
but repaying those ^[Hebrew "the one"] who hate him _in their own person_ ^[Literally "to their faces"] to destroy them; ^[Hebrew "him"; "them" in sense] he is not slow with those who hate him _in their own person_; ^[Literally "to their faces"] he repays them. ^[Hebrew "him"]

###### v11
And _so_ you shall keep the commandment and the rules and the regulations that I _am_ commanding you _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] to observe them.

###### v12
"_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] because you listen _to_ these regulations and you diligently keep and you do them, then Yahweh your God will maintain his ^[Hebrew "the"] covenant and his ^[Or "fathers"] loyal love that he swore to your ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v13
And he will love you, and he will bless you, and he will multiply you, and he will bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your soil, your grain, your wine, and your olive oil, and _newborn_ calves of your cattle, and the _newborn_ lambs ^[Or "increase of"] of your flocks in the land that he swore to your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] to give you.

###### v14
You shall be blessed more than all of the peoples; among you there shall not be sterility and bareness, even ^[Hebrew "and"] among domestic animals. ^[Hebrew "animal"]

###### v15
And Yahweh will turn away from you all the illness and all the harmful diseases of Egypt that you experienced; he will not lay them on you, but he will lay them on all _of_ those who hate you.

###### v16
And you shall devour all of the peoples _that_ Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you; _you shall not pity them_, ^[Literally "your eye shall not take pity on them"] and you shall not serve their gods, _which_ will be a snare for you.

###### v17
"If you think in your heart, 'These nations _are_ more numerous than I, so how can I dispossess them?'

###### v18
_then remember_ you must not be afraid of them; you must well remember what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh and to all _of_ Egypt:

###### v19
the great trials that your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the _workings of_ the strong hand and the outstretched arm _by_ which Yahweh your God brought you out; so Yahweh your God will do to all _of_ the peoples _because of whom_ ^[Literally "from them"] you _are_ in fear _before them_. ^[Literally "from their presence"]

###### v20
And, moreover, Yahweh your God will send the hornets ^[Hebrew "hornet"] among them until _both_ the survivors and the fugitives _are destroyed_ ^[Literally "the destroying of"] _before you_. ^[Literally "from your faces"]

###### v21
You must not _be in dread_ from the presence of them, because Yahweh your God, _who is_ in your midst, _is_ a great and awesome God.

###### v22
And Yahweh your God will clear away these nations _from before you_ ^[Literally "from your faces"] little by little; you will not be able to finish them off quickly, _lest_ ^[Literally "so that not"] the _wild animals_ ^[Literally "animals of the field"] _multiply_ ^[Literally "will become numerous"] _against you_. ^[Literally "on you"]

###### v23
But Yahweh your God will _give them to you_, ^[Literally "give them to your face"] and he will throw them into great panic _until they are destroyed_. ^[Literally "until their destroying"]

###### v24
And he will give their kings into your hand, and you shall blot out their names ^[Hebrew "name"] from under the heaven; anyone will not _be able to_ stand _against you_ ^[Literally "in your faces"] _until you destroy them_. ^[Literally "until your destroying them"]

###### v25
You shall burn the images of their gods with fire; you shall not covet _the_ silver or gold _that is_ on them, and _so_ you take _it_ for yourself, so that you are not ensnared by it, for it _is_ a detestable thing to Yahweh your God.

###### v26
And you must not bring a detestable thing into your house, or you will become a thing devoted to destruction like it; you must utterly detest it, and you must utterly abhor it, for it _is_ _an_ object devoted to destruction.
