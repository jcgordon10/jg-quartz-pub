###### v1
"All of the commandments ^[Or "every commandment"] that I _am_ commanding you today you must diligently observe, so that you may live and multiply, and you may go and take possession of the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors. ^[Or "your fathers"]

###### v2
And you shall remember all _of_ the way that Yahweh your God led you _during_ these forty years in the desert in order to humble you and to test you to know what _is_ in your heart, whether you would _diligently_ keep his commandments or not.

###### v3
And he humbled you and let you go hungry, and _then_ he fed you with that which you did not know nor did your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] know, in order to make you know that not by bread alone but by all _that_ goes out ^[Or "by all _of_ the going out of"] of the mouth of Yahweh humankind shall live.

###### v4
Your clothing did not wear out _on you_, ^[Literally "from on you"] and your feet did not swell _during_ these forty years.

###### v5
And you should know with your heart that as a man disciplines his son, _so_ Yahweh your God _is_ disciplining you. ^[Or "has disciplined you"]

###### v6
So you must keep the commandments of Yahweh your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him.

###### v7
For Yahweh your God _is_ bringing you to a good land _with_ streams of water, springs and underground water, welling up in the valleys ^[Hebrew "valley"] and in the hills, ^[Hebrew "hill"]

###### v8
_to_ a land of wheat and barley and vines ^[Hebrew "vine"] and fig trees ^[Hebrew "fig tree"] and pomegranate trees, ^[Hebrew "pomegranate tree"] a land of olive trees, ^[Hebrew "olive tree"] olive oil and honey;

###### v9
_to_ a land where you may eat food in it _without scarcity_; ^[Literally "not in scarcity"] you will not find anything lacking in it, a land where its stones _are_ iron and from its mountains you can mine copper.

###### v10
And you will eat, and _you will be satisfied_, ^[Literally "you will eat your fill"] and you will bless Yahweh your God because _of_ the good land that he has given to you.

###### v11
"Take care for yourself so that you not forget Yahweh your God _by_ not keeping his commandments and his regulations and his statutes that I _am_ commanding you _today_, ^[Literally "the day"]

###### v12
lest _when_ you have eaten and you are satisfied and you have built good houses and you live _in them_,

###### v13
and your herds and your flocks have multiplied, and _you have accumulated silver and gold_, ^[Literally "and silver and gold has multiplied for you"] and all that _you have_ ^[Literally "is for you"] has multiplied,

###### v14
then your heart _becomes proud_ ^[Literally "raises up"] and you forget Yahweh your God, _the one who brought you out_ ^[Literally "the one bringing you out"] from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery,

###### v15
the one leading you in the great and terrible desert _infested_ with _dangerous_ ^[Literally "burning"] snakes ^[Hebrew "snake"] and scorpions ^[Hebrew "scorpion"] and parched ground, where there is ^[Or "was"] no water, _and_ the one bringing out water for you from flint rock,

###### v16
the one _feeding you_ ^[Literally "causing you to eat"] manna in the desert, _food_ that your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] did not know, in order to humble you and in order to test you _so that he could_ do good to you _in the future_. ^[Literally "in the end/later"]

###### v17
And you may think ^[Or "say"] in your heart, 'My strength and the might of my hand _acquired this wealth for_ ^[Literally "gave this wealth to"] me.'

###### v18
But you must remember Yahweh your God, for he _is_ the _one_ giving you strength to acquire wealth in order to confirm his covenant that he swore to your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] _as it is today_. ^[Literally "as the day the this"]

###### v19
And it will happen _that_ if you indeed forget Yahweh your God and you go after other gods and you serve them and you bow down before them, I warn you today that you will surely perish.

###### v20
As _with_ the nations that Yahweh _is_ destroying _before you_, ^[Literally "from your faces"] so you shall perish because you would not obey the voice of Yahweh your God.
