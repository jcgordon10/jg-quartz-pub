###### v1
"Hear, Israel, you _are_ about to cross the Jordan today to go to dispossess nations larger and more numerous than you, great cities fortified _with high walls_, ^[Literally "in heaven/the sky"]

###### v2
a great and tall people, the sons of _the_ Anakites, whom you know and _of whom you_ have heard _it said_, 'Who could stand before the sons of Anak?'

###### v3
You should know _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] that Yahweh your God is the one crossing _ahead of you_ ^[Literally "to your faces"] _as_ a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will subdue them before you; so you will dispossess them, and you will destroy them quickly, _just as_ ^[Literally "as that"] Yahweh _promised_ ^[Literally "spoke"] you.

###### v4
"You shall not say _to yourself_ ^[Literally "in your heart"] _when Yahweh your God is driving them out_ ^[Literally "at the driving out of Yahweh, your God, them"] _before you_, ^[Literally "from before your faces"] _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Because of my righteousness Yahweh brought me to take possession of this land'; but because of the wickedness of these nations Yahweh _is_ driving them out _before you_. ^[Literally "from your faces"]

###### v5
_It is_ not because of your righteousness and because of the uprightness of your heart _that_ you _are_ coming to take possession of their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God _is_ driving them _before you_, ^[Literally "from your faces"] and in order to confirm the _promise_ ^[Literally "word"] that Yahweh swore to your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

###### v6
"So you should understand that _it is_ not because of your righteousness _that_ Yahweh your God _is_ giving you this good land to take possession of it, because _you are a stubborn people_.  ^[Literally "a people stiff of neck you"]

###### v7
Remember, _do not forget_, ^[Literally "not you shall forget"] that you provoked Yahweh your God in the desert, _and_ from the day that you went out from the land of Egypt until _you came to this place_ ^[Literally "your coming up to this place the this" = until arrived at this location] you were rebelling against Yahweh.

###### v8
"And _remember_ at Horeb you provoked Yahweh, and Yahweh became angry _enough_ to destroy you.

###### v9
_When I went up the mountain_ ^[Literally "In/At my going up the mountain"] to receive _the stone tablets_, ^[Literally "the tablets of stones"] the tablets of the covenant that Yahweh _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] with you, and remained on the mountain forty days ^[Hebrew "day"] and forty nights, ^[Hebrew "night"] I did not eat food and I did not drink water.

###### v10
And Yahweh gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them _was writing_ according to all the words that Yahweh spoke with you at the mountain, from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.

###### v11
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it happened"] at the end of forty days ^[Hebrew "day"] and forty nights, ^[Hebrew "night"] Yahweh gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.

###### v12
And Yahweh said to me, 'Come _now_, go down quickly from this mountain because your people behave corruptly whom you brought out from Egypt, _for_ they turned quickly from the way that I commanded them _to follow_; they have made for themselves a cast image.'

###### v13
And Yahweh spoke to me, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'I have seen this people, and look! _They are a stubborn people_. ^[Literally "It is a people stiff of neck"]

###### v14
Leave me alone, and let me destroy them, and let me blot out their name from under heaven, and let me make you into a nation mightier and more numerous than they!'

###### v15
"And I turned, and I went down the mountain, as the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant _were_ in my two hands.

###### v16
And I looked, ^[Or "saw"] and indeed you had sinned against Yahweh your God; you _had_ made for yourselves an image of a calf _of_ cast metal;  ^[Or "molten calf"] you _had_ turned quickly from the way that Yahweh had commanded _for_ you.

###### v17
And I took hold of the two tablets, and I threw them out _of_ ^[Literally "from"] my two hands and smashed them before your eyes.

###### v18
And _then_ I lay prostrate _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] Yahweh, as earlier, forty days ^[Hebrew "day"] and forty nights; ^[Hebrew "night"] I did not eat food and I did not drink water because of all your sins that you committed, by doing evil in the eyes of Yahweh _and so_ provoking him.

###### v19
For _I was in dread_ ^[Literally "I dreaded"] from _being in_ the presence of the anger and the wrath _with_ which Yahweh was angry with you _so as_ to destroy you, but Yahweh listened to me also _at that time_. ^[Literally "the occurrence the that"]

###### v20
And with Aaron Yahweh was _angry enough_ ^[Literally "very angry"] to destroy him, and I prayed also for Aaron at that time.

###### v21
And your sinful thing that you had made, the molten calf, I took and I burned it with fire, and I crushed it, grinding it thoroughly until it was crushed to dust, and I threw its dust into _the stream that flowed down the mountain_. ^[Literally "the stream the _one_ going down from the mountain"]

###### v22
"And _also_ at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Yahweh to anger.

###### v23
And when Yahweh sent you _out_ from Kadesh Barnea, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,' you rebelled against the command of Yahweh your God, and you did not believe him, and you did not listen to his voice.

###### v24
You have been rebellious toward Yahweh _from the day I have known you_. ^[Literally "from the day of my knowing you"]

###### v25
"And I lay prostrate before Yahweh through forty days, ^[Hebrew "day"] and through forty nights ^[Hebrew "night"] I prostrated myself, because Yahweh intended to kill you.

###### v26
And I prayed to Yahweh, and I said, 'Lord Yahweh, you must not destroy your people and your inheritance whom you redeemed in your greatness, ^[Or "your great act"] whom you brought out from Egypt with a strong hand.

###### v27
Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; you must not _pay attention to_ ^[Literally "turn toward"] the stubbornness of this people, to their wickedness and to their sin,

###### v28
lest _the people of_ the land from which you brought us out from there say, "Because Yahweh was not able to bring them to the land that he _promised_ ^[Literally "spoken"] to them and because of his hatred _toward_ them, he has brought them out to kill them in the desert."

###### v29
For they _are_ your people and your inheritance whom you brought with your great power and with your outstretched arm.'
