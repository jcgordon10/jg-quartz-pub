###### v1
"At that time Yahweh said to me, 'Carve for yourself two tablets of stone _just_ as the former _ones_, and come up the mountain to me, and you shall make for yourself an ark of wood.

###### v2
And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former _tablets_, which you smashed, and you must put them in the ark.'

###### v3
And _so_ I made an ark _of acacia wood_, ^[Literally "of wood of acacia trees"] and I carved two tablets of stone like the former _ones_, and I went up the mountain _with_ the two tablets in my hand.

###### v4
And he wrote upon the tablets _according to the first writing_, ^[Literally "as the writing the first"] the ten words that Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly, and Yahweh gave them to me.

###### v5
And I turned, and I came down from the mountain, and I put the tablets in the ark that I had made, and they are there, _just_ as Yahweh commanded me.

###### v6
"And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] journeyed from _the_ wells of Bene-Yaqan _to_ Moserah; there Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar, his son, served as a priest in place of him.

###### v7
From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land _flowing with_ streams of water.

###### v8
At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to stand _before_ ^[Literally "the faces of"] Yahweh, to serve him and to bless _the people_ in his name until this day.

###### v9
Therefore _there was not_ ^[Literally "it/he was not"] for Levi an allotment or an inheritance _along_ with his brothers; _rather_ Yahweh _is_ his inheritance _just_ as Yahweh your God _promised_ ^[Literally "spoke"] to him.

###### v10
And I stayed on the mountain _just_ as _during_ the former forty days ^[Hebrew "day"] and forty nights, ^[Hebrew "night"] and Yahweh listened to me also on that occasion; ^[Or "occurrence" or "that time"] Yahweh was not willing to destroy you.

###### v11
And Yahweh said to me, '_Come, continue_ ^[Literally "Arise, go"] your journey _before the people_,  ^[Literally "in the faces of the people"] so that you may go and take possession of the land that I swore to their ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] to give to them.'

###### v12
And now, Israel, what _is_ Yahweh your God asking ^[Or "requiring"] from you, except ^[Or "but only"] to revere Yahweh your God, to go ^[Or "to walk"] in all his ways and to love him and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, ^[Or "inner self"]

###### v13
to keep the commandments of Yahweh and his statutes that I am commanding you today _for your own good_. ^[Literally "for good to you"]

###### v14
Look! For to Yahweh your God _belong_ ^[Literally "is"] heaven and the _highest heavens_, ^[Literally "heavens of the heavens"] the earth and all that _is_ in it.

###### v15
_Yet_ ^[Literally "Only"] to your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] Yahweh was very attached, _so as to_ love them, and _so_ he chose their offspring after them, _namely_ you, from all the peoples, as it is _today_. ^[Literally "the day the this"]

###### v16
So you shall circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and _do not be stubborn_. ^[Literally "your neck you shall not make stiff _any_ longer"]

###### v17
For Yahweh your God, he _is_ God of the gods and Lord of the lords, the great and mighty God, the awesome _one_ who _is not partial_, ^[Literally "_does_ not lift up faces"] and he does not take bribes.

###### v18
_And he_ executes justice for the orphan and widow, and _he is_ one who loves _the_ alien, to give to them food and clothing.

###### v19
And you shall love the alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.

###### v20
Yahweh your God, you shall revere him, you shall serve him, and to him you shall cling, and by his name you shall swear.

###### v21
He _is_ your praise, and he _is_ your God, who has done with you these great and awesome _things_ that your eyes have seen.

###### v22
With _only_ seventy persons your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] went down to Egypt, but now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the heaven _with respect to multitude_. ^[Literally "as far as number"]
