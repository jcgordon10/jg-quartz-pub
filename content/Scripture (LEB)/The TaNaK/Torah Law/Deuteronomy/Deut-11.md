[[Deut-10|Previous Chapter]] | [[Deut-12|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
"And you shall love Yahweh your God, and you shall keep his obligations and his statutes and his regulations and his commandments _always_. ^[Literally "all _of_ the days"]

###### v2
And you shall realize _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] that _it is_ not _with_ your children who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of Yahweh your God--his greatness, his strong hand, and his outstretched arm,

###### v3
and his signs and his deeds that he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all _of_ his land,

###### v4
and what he did to the army of Egypt and to their horses and to their chariots, _and_ how he made the water of the _Red Sea_ ^[Literally "sea of reed"] flow over them, _when they pursued after them_, ^[Literally "in/at their pursuing after them"] and so Yahweh has destroyed them, _as is the case today_, ^[Literally "until the day the this"]

###### v5
and what he did to you in the desert until you came up to this place,

###### v6
and what he did to Dathan and to Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth wide and swallowed them, their households and their tents, and all _of_ the living creatures ^[Hebrew "creature"] that _were_ in their possession _and that were_ _following along with them_ ^[Literally "in their feet" = "living things traveling along with them"] in the midst of all _of_ Israel.

###### v7
The fact of the matter is, _your own eyes have seen_ ^[Literally "your eyes that are seeing"] all _of_ the great deeds ^[Hebrew "deed"] of Yahweh that he did.

###### v8
"And you must keep all _of_ the commandments ^[Hebrew "commandment"] that I _am_ commanding you _today_, ^[Literally "the day"] so that you may have strength and _you may_ go and _you may_ take possession of that land _to which you are crossing_ ^[Literally "you are crossing there"] to take possession of it,

###### v9
so that _you may live long_ ^[Literally "you may make long days"] on the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] to give _it_ to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey.

###### v10
For the fact is _that_ the land _that you are about to go into_ ^[Literally "you are about to go there"] to take possession of it _is_ not like the land of Egypt, _from_ which you have _come out of_, ^[Literally "come out from there"] where you sow your seed and you give water by _your_ foot, _as in a vegetable garden_. ^[Literally "as _the_ garden of _the_ vegetables"]

###### v11
But the land that you _are_ about to cross into to take possession of it _is_ a land of hills and valleys, _and_ by the rain of the heaven it drinks water,

###### v12
a land that Yahweh your God _is_ caring for it; continually the eyes of Yahweh your God _are_ on it, from the beginning of the year up to the end of _the_ year.

###### v13
"And it will happen _that_ if you listen carefully to my commandments that I _am_ commanding you _today_, ^[Literally "the day"] to love Yahweh your God, and to serve him with all _of_ your heart and with all _of_ your soul, ^[Or "inner self"]

###### v14
then 'I will send the rain for your land in its season, early rain and later rain, and you will gather your grain and your wine and your olive oil.

###### v15
And I will give vegetation in your field for your livestock, and _you will eat your fill_.' ^[Literally "you will eat and you will be satisfied"]

###### v16
_Take care_ ^[Literally "Watch for yourself"] so that your heart is not easily deceived, and you turn away, and you serve other gods, and you bow down to them.

###### v17
And _then_ _the anger of Yahweh will be kindled against you_, ^[Literally "the nose of Yahweh become hot against you"] and he will shut up the heavens, ^[Or "sky"] and there shall not be rain, and _so_ the ground will not give its produce, and you will perish quickly from the good land that Yahweh _is_ giving to you.

###### v18
"And you shall put these, my words, on your heart and on your inner self, ^[Or "soul"] and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand and let them be as an emblem between your eyes.

###### v19
And you shall teach them to your children ^[Or "sons"] by talking about them when you sit in your house and when you travel on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.

###### v20
And you shall write them on the doorframes of your house and on your gates,

###### v21
so that _they_ may multiply your days and the days of your children on the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] to give _it_ to them _as long as heaven endures over the earth_. ^[Literally "like the days of heaven above the earth"]

###### v22
Yes, if you diligently keep all ^[Or "every one of"] this commandment that I _am_ commanding you _to observe it_,  ^[Literally "to do it"] by loving Yahweh your God _by walking in_ ^[Literally "to walk in"] all his ways and by holding fast to him,

###### v23
then Yahweh will drive out all _of_ these nations _before you_, ^[Literally "to the face of you"] and you will dispossess nations larger and more numerous than you.

###### v24
Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, it shall be yours; your boundary shall be from the desert and Lebanon from the river, the river Euphrates, on up to the western sea. ^[That is, the Mediterranean Sea]

###### v25
No one can take a stand _against you_; ^[Literally "to your faces"] your dread and your fear Yahweh your God will put on the _surface_ ^[Literally "faces"] of all the land _where you tread_, ^[Literally "which you tread in it"] _just_ as he _promised_ ^[Literally "spoke"] to you.

###### v26
"See, I am setting _before you_ ^[Literally "to the face of you"] _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] a blessing and a curse:

###### v27
the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God that I _am_ commanding you _today_, ^[Literally "the day"]

###### v28
and the curse, if you _do_ not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but _rather_ you turn from the way that I _am_ commanding you _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] to go after other gods that you have not known.

###### v29
"And it will happen _that_ when Yahweh your God has brought you to _the land that you are going to_, ^[Literally "the land that you are going there"] to take possession of it, then ^[Hebrew "and"] you shall pronounce the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.

###### v30
(Are they not beyond the Jordan, _toward the west_, ^[Literally "after the way of the descent of the sun"] in the land of the Canaanites living in the Jordan Valley, ^[Hebrew "in the Arabah"] opposite Gilgal beside the terebinth ^[Or "oaks"] of Moreh?)

###### v31
For you are _now_ about to cross the Jordan to go to take possession of the land that Yahweh, your God, _is_ giving to you, and you will take possession of it and live in it,

###### v32
and you must diligently _observe_ ^[Literally "observe to do"] all the rules and the regulations that I _am_ setting _before you_ ^[Literally "before your face"] _today_." ^[Literally "the day"]
