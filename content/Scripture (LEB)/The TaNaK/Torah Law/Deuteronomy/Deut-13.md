###### v1
"If a prophet stands up in your midst or a dreamer of dreams ^[Hebrew "dream"] and he gives to you a sign or wonder,

###### v2
and the sign or ^[Hebrew "and"] the wonder comes _about_ that he spoke ^[Or "promised/declared"] to you, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Let us go after other gods (those whom you have not known), and let us serve them,'

###### v3
you must not listen to the words of that prophet or to that dreamer, for Yahweh your God _is testing you to know whether you love_ ^[Literally "a testing of Yahweh your God concerning you _in order_ to know whether there is you loving"] Yahweh your God with all of your heart and with all _of_ your inner self. ^[Or "soul"]

###### v4
You shall go after Yahweh your God, and him you shall revere, and his commandment you shall keep, and to his voice you shall listen, and him you shall serve, and to him you shall hold fast.

###### v5
But that prophet or the dreamer of that dream shall be executed, for he spoke falsely about Yahweh your God, the _one_ bringing you out from the land of Egypt and the _one_ redeeming you from the house of slavery, in order to seduce you from the way that Yahweh your God commanded you to go in it; so _in this way_ you shall purge the evil from your midst.

###### v6
"If your brother, the son of your mother or your son or your daughter _or your wife whom you embrace_ ^[Literally "or the wife of your embrace"] or _your intimate friend_ ^[Literally "your friend who is like your soul/inner self"] in secrecy _says_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Let us go and let us serve other gods!' _gods_ that you and your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] have not known,

###### v7
from _among_ the gods of the people who are around you, _those near you or those far from you_, ^[Literally "the near ones to you or the distant ones from you"] from _one_ end of the earth and up to the _other_ end of the earth,

###### v8
you must not give in to him, and you shall not listen to him, and your eye shall not take pity on him, and you shall not have compassion, and you shall not cover _up_ ^[Or "conceal" him] for him.

###### v9
But you shall certainly kill him; your hand shall be first against him to kill him and next the hand of all _of_ the people.

###### v10
And you shall stone him with stones and let him die, for he tried to seduce you from Yahweh your God, the _one_ bringing you from _the_ land of Egypt, from the house of slavery.

###### v11
And all _of_ Israel shall hear, and they shall fear, and _they shall not continue to act_ ^[Literally "they shall not add to do"] according to this evil thing in your midst.

###### v12
"If you hear in one of your towns which Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you to live in, _someone_ _saying that_ ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v13
_worthless men_ ^[Literally "sons of Belial"] have gone out from your midst and have seduced the inhabitants of their town, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Let us go and serve other gods!' whom you have not known,

###### v14
then you shall inquire and examine and interrogate thoroughly, and, look! _It is_ true; the thing has actually been done, this detestable thing in your midst,

###### v15
_then_ you shall certainly strike down the inhabitants of that town with the _edge_ ^[Literally "mouth"] of _the_ sword; you shall destroy it and everything in it, its domestic animals with _the_ _edge_ ^[Literally "mouth"] of _the_ sword.

###### v16
And _then_ you shall gather all of its booty into the middle of its public square, and you shall burn the town and all _of_ its war-booty totally for Yahweh your God, and it shall be _a pile of rubble forever_; ^[Literally "a tell/ruin forever"] it shall not be built again.

###### v17
And let not something cling to your hand from the things devoted to destruction, so that Yahweh may turn back _from his burning anger_, ^[Literally "from the burning of his nose"] and he may show compassion to you and he may _continue_ to show compassion and _so_ multiply you _just as he swore_ ^[Literally "as that he swore"] to your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v18
if you listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all _of_ his commandments that I _am_ commanding _to_ you _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] _so as_ to do the right _thing_ in the eyes of Yahweh your God."
