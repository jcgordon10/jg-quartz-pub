and the red kite ^[Various options are available: large bird, kite, red kite, glede, buzzard] and the black kite or _any kind of falcon_, ^[Literally "or the falcon according to its kind"; other options for falcon: bird, falcon, kite (others as carrion-bird), vulture, crow or raven, buzzard]

###### v22
"Certainly you must give a tithe _of_ all the yield of your seed, _which comes forth from your field year after year_. ^[Literally "the going forth of the field year _by_ year"]

And you shall eat _before_ ^[Literally "before the faces of"] Yahweh your God in the place that he will choose to make to dwell his name there the tithe of your grain, your wine and your olive oil and the firstling of your herd and your flock, so that you may learn to revere Yahweh your God _always_. ^[Literally "all of the days"]

###### v24
But if _the distance is too great for you_, ^[Literally "_it_ is great from you the journey that"] _so_ that you are not able to transport ^[Or "carry"] it, because the place that Yahweh your God will choose to set his name there, it is _too_ far from you, when Yahweh your God will bless you,
