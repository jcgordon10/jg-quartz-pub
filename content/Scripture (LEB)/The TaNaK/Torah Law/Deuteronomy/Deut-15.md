###### v1
"At the end of seven years you shall grant _a_ remission of debt.

###### v2
And this _is_ the manner of the remission of debt: every _creditor_ ^[Literally "owner of the loan of his hand"] shall remit his claim that he holds against his neighbor, and he shall not exact payment _from_ his brother because there ^[Hebrew "it"] _a_ remission of debt has been proclaimed unto ^[Hebrew "for"] Yahweh.

###### v3
_With respect to_ the foreigner you may exact payment, but _you must remit_ ^[Literally "your hand shall remit"] what shall be _owed_ to you _with respect to_ your brother.

###### v4
Nevertheless, there ^[Hebrew "it"] shall not be among you a poor _person_, because Yahweh will certainly bless you in the land that Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you _as_ an inheritance, to take possession of it.

###### v5
If only you listen well to the voice of Yahweh your God _by observing diligently_ ^[Literally "to observe _so as_ to do"] all of these commandments ^[Hebrew "commandment"] that I _am_ commanding you _today_. ^[Literally "the day"]

###### v6
When Yahweh your God has blessed you, _just_ as he _promised_ ^[Literally "spoke"] to you, then you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow _from them_, and you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.

###### v7
If _there_ is a poor _person_ among you from _among_ one of your brothers in one of your _towns_ ^[Literally "gates"] that Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you, you shall not harden your heart, and you shall not shut your hand toward _your brother who is poor_. ^[Literally "from among your brothers, the poor one"]

###### v8
But you shall certainly open your hand for him, and _you shall willingly lend_ ^[Literally "lending you shall lend"] _to_ him enough to meet his need, _whatever it is_. ^[Literally "whatever is lacking for him"]

###### v9
_Take care_ ^[Literally "Watch for yourself"] so that there ^[Hebrew "it"] will not be _a thought of wickedness_ ^[Literally "a thing in your heart wickedness"] in your heart, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'The seventh year, the year of the remission of debt is near,' _and you view your needy neighbor with hostility_, ^[Literally "is bad your eye against your brother who is needy"] and _so_ you _do_ not give to him, and he might cry _out_ against you to Yahweh, and _you would incur guilt against yourself_. ^[Literally "it will be against you a sin"]

###### v10
By all means you must give to him, and _you must not be discontented_ ^[Literally "and not shall be bad/evil your heart at/when"] at your giving to him, because on account of this _very_ thing, Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work and _in all that you undertake_. ^[Literally "in all _of_ the sending/putting forth of your hand"]

###### v11
For the poor ^[Or "the needy person"] will not cease to be _among you_ ^[Literally "from the midst of "] _in_ the land; therefore I _am_ commanding you, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'You shall willingly open your hand to your brother, to your needy and to your poor _that are_ in your land.'

###### v12
If your relative ^[Or "brother"] who is a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman is sold to you, and _he or she_ has served you six years, then in the seventh year you shall send that person _out_ _free_. ^[Literally "free from with you"]

###### v13
And when you send him _out_ free from you, you shall not send him _away_ empty-handed.

###### v14
You shall generously supply him from _among_ your flocks and from your threshing floor and from your press; _according to_ that _with which_ Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.

###### v15
And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you; therefore I _am_ commanding you thus _today_. ^[Literally "the day"]

###### v16
And then _if_ it will happen _that_ he says to you, '_I do not want to go out_ ^[Literally "I will not go out"] from you,' because he loves you and your family, because it is good for him _to be_ with you;

###### v17
then you shall take an awl, and you shall thrust _it_ through his earlobe and into the door, and he shall be to you _a slave forever_; ^[Literally "a slave of eternity"] and you shall also do likewise for your slave woman.

###### v18
It shall not be hard in your eyes _when you send him forth free_, ^[Literally "in/at you to send him forth free from _being_ with you"] because for six years he has served you _worth_ twice the wage of a hired worker; and Yahweh your God will bless you _in whatever you will do_. ^[Literally "in all _of_ that you will do"]

###### v19
"Every firstling male that is born of your herd and of your flock you shall consecrate to Yahweh your God; you shall not do work with the firstling of your ox, and you shall not shear the firstling of your flock.

###### v20
_Rather_ _before Yahweh_ ^[Literally "in the face of Yahweh"] your God you shall eat it year by year at the place Yahweh will choose, you and your household.

###### v21
But if there is a physical defect in it, _such as_ lameness or blindness, any serious defect, you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God.

###### v22
In your _towns_ ^[Literally "gates"] you shall eat it, the unclean and the clean together _may eat it_, _just_ as _they eat_ the gazelle and as _they eat_ the deer.

###### v23
But you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it on the ground like water."
