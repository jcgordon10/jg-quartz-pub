###### v1
"And there shall not be for the Levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, a plot of ground and an inheritance with Israel, _rather_ they may eat an offering made by fire _as_ their inheritance, ^[The meaning of the Hebrew text here is uncertain; possibly it reads: "_rather_ an offering by fire then they will eat as _their_ inheritance/patrimony"] for Yahweh.

###### v2
And there shall not be for them ^[Hebrew "him"] an inheritance _of land_ in the midst of his brothers; _rather_ Yahweh is his inheritance, _just_ as he _promised_ ^[Literally "spoke"] to them. ^[Hebrew "him"]

###### v3
Now this shall be the share of the priest from the people, from _those who sacrifice the sacrifice_, ^[Literally "the sacrificers of the sacrifice"] _whether it is_ an ox, sheep, or goat, and they shall give the priest the shoulder and the jawbones and the stomach.

###### v8
They shall eat _equal portions_, ^[Literally "a portion like a portion"] apart from what he may receive from the sale of his patrimony. ^[Hebrew meaning of these phrases/words is not certain; also could translate as "except _what they receive_ from the sale of their fathers' _estates_" (NASB); or "what he may inherit from his father's family"]

"Yahweh your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your midst, from your countrymen, ^[Or "your brothers"] _and_ to him you shall listen.

###### v16
_This is_ _according to all that you asked_ ^[Literally "_just_ as all _of_ that you asked"] from Yahweh your God at Horeb, on the day of the assembly, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] '_I do not want again to hear_ ^[Literally "not I want to do again to hear"] the voice of Yahweh my God, _and_ I do not want to see again this great fire, so that I may not die!'

###### v17
And Yahweh said to me, 'They are right _in_ what they have said.

###### v18
I will raise up a prophet for them _from among their countrymen_ ^[Literally "from the midst of their brothers"] like you, and I will place ^[Or "give"] my words into his mouth, and he shall speak to them _everything that I command him_. ^[Literally "all _of_ what I command him"]

_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] the man that will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I will hold accountable.
