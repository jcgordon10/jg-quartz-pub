###### v1
"When Yahweh your God has _exterminated_ ^[Literally "cut off"] the nations _concerning whom_ Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you their land, and you have dispossessed them, and you have settled in their towns and in their houses,

###### v2
you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land that Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you to take possession of it.

###### v3
You shall prepare the roads ^[Hebrew "road"] for yourselves, and you shall divide the regions of your land into thirds that Yahweh your God gives you as a possession, so that _it will be available for any manslayer to flee there_. ^[Literally "it shall be to flee there all/anyone killing"]

###### v4
"Now this _is_ the case of the manslayer who may flee there and live _there_ who has killed his neighbor _unintentionally_, ^[Literally "with no knowledge"] and he did not hate him _previously_. ^[Literally "from yesterday _and the_ day before"]

###### v5
_For example_, ^[Literally "And as"] when somebody goes with his neighbor into the forest to cut wood, and the iron _head_ slips from the handle _of the tool_ and strikes his neighbor and he dies, _then_ he may flee to one of these cities, and _so_ he may live.

###### v6
_He does this_ lest the avenger of blood might pursue after the killer, because _he is hot with anger_ ^[Literally "is hot his heart"] and he overtakes him, because it is a long distance _to the city of refuge_, and _so_ _he kills him_, ^[Literally "he strikes him down as to his life/soul"] but _he did not deserve a death sentence_, ^[Literally "for him there was not a judgment of death"] because he _was_ not hating him _before_. ^[Literally "from yesterday _and the_ day before"]

###### v7
Therefore I _am_ commanding you, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'You shall set apart three cities.'

###### v8
Then if Yahweh your God enlarges your territory _just_ as he swore to your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] and gives ^[Hebrew "will give"] to you all the land that he _promised_ ^[Literally "spoke"] to give to your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v9
_then_ _if you diligently observe this entire commandment_ ^[Literally "if you observe all _of_ the commandment the this to do it"] that I _am_ commanding you _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] by loving Yahweh your God and by going ^[Or "walking"] in his ways _at all times_, ^[Literally "all _of_ the days"] then you shall add three more cities for yourselves to these three.

###### v10
_Do this_ so that innocent blood will not be shed ^[Hebrew "is not shed"] in the midst of your land that Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you _as an_ inheritance and _thereby_ bloodguilt would be on you. ^[Hebrew "shall be on you," but conditional sense of imperfect is clear]

###### v11
But if someone hates ^[Hebrew "_is_ hating"] his neighbor and lies in wait for him and rises up ^[Or "gets up"] against him _and murders him_, ^[Literally "and strikes him mortally _with regard to his life_ and he dies"] and _the murderer_ flees to one of these cities,

###### v12
then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there, and they shall give him into the hand of the avenger of blood, and he shall be put to death.

###### v13
Your eye shall not take pity on him, and you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, _so that good will be directed toward you_. ^[Literally "and good shall be for you" or "it shall be good for you"]

###### v14
"You shall not move the boundary _marker_ of your neighbor that _former generations_ ^[Literally "the first settlers/ancestors"] set up on your property in the land that Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you to take possession of it.

###### v15
_The testimony of a single witness may not be used to convict_ ^[Literally "Not shall get up _only_ a single witness against a man"] _with respect to_ any crime and for any wrongdoing in any offense that a person ^[Hebrew "he"] committed; on the _evidence_ ^[Literally "mouth"] of two witnesses or on the _evidence_ ^[Literally "mouth"] of three witnesses _a charge shall be sustained_. ^[Literally "shall be established a case/charge"]

###### v16
If _a malicious witness_ ^[Literally "a witness of violence"] gets up _to accuse_ ^[Literally "against"] anyone to testify against him falsely,

###### v17
then the two men _to whom the legal dispute pertains_ ^[Literally "who for them _are_ the legal dispute"] shall stand _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] Yahweh, _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] the priests and the judges who are _in office_ in those days.

###### v18
Then judges shall make a thorough inquiry, and _if_ it turns out ^[Or "in fact"] that the witness is a false witness _and_ he testified falsely against his brother,

###### v19
then you shall do to him as he meant ^[Or "planned"] to do to his brother, and so you shall purge the evil from your midst.

###### v20
_And the rest_ ^[Literally "and those remaining"] shall hear and shall fear, and _they shall not continue to do such a thing again_ ^[Literally "and they shall not do again to do again"] as this evil thing in your midst.

###### v21
_You must show no pity_: ^[Literally "And not take pity your eye"] life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."
