###### v1
"If you go out to war against your enemies and you see a horse and a chariot, _an army_ ^[Literally "a people"] larger that you, you shall not be afraid because of them; for Yahweh your God _is_ with you, the one who brought you from the land of Egypt.

###### v2
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] when you approach the battle, then the priest shall come near and speak to the troops.

And he shall say to them, 'Hear, Israel, you are near _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] to the battle against your enemies; _do not lose heart_; ^[Literally "do not be faint/tender-hearted"] you shall not be afraid, and you shall not panic, and you shall not be terrified _because of them_, ^[Literally "from their faces"]

###### v4
for Yahweh your God _is_ going with you to fight for you against your enemies to help you.'

###### v5
And the officials shall speak to the troops, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] 'Who _is_ the man who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to this house, so that he does not die in battle and _another man_ ^[Literally "a man other"] dedicates it.

###### v6

And who _is_ the man who got engaged to a woman and _has_ not married her? Let him go and let him return to his house, so that he does not die in battle and _another man_ ^[Literally "a man other"] marries her.'

###### v8
And the officials shall continue to speak to the troops, and they shall say, '_What man_ ^[Literally "Who is the man"] is afraid _and disheartened_? ^[Literally "and soft/weak of the heart"] Let him go, and let him return to his house, and let him not cause the heart of his brothers to melt ^[The verb has a causal meaning here] like his.'

###### v9
And _when the officials have finished speaking_ ^[Literally "it will happen as to finish the officials to speak"] to the army troops, then they shall appoint commanders of divisions at the head of the troops.

###### v10
"When you approach a city to fight against it, _you must offer it peace_. ^[Literally "you should call it for peace"]

###### v11
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] if _they accept your terms of peace_ ^[Literally "if peace they reply to you"] and _they surrender to you_, ^[Literally "they open to you"] _and then_ ^[Literally "and it will happen"] all the people _inhabiting it_ ^[Literally "being found in it"] shall be forced labor for you, and they shall serve you.

###### v12
But if they _do not accept your terms of peace_ ^[Literally "not they make peace with you"] and they want to make war with you, then you shall lay siege against it. ^[That is, the city]

###### v13
And Yahweh your God will give it into your hand, and you shall kill all its males with the _edge_ ^[Literally "mouth"] of _the_ sword.

###### v14
Only the women and the little children and the domestic animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] and all that shall be in the city, all of its spoil you may loot for yourselves, and you may enjoy the spoil of your enemies that Yahweh you God has given to you.

###### v15
Thus you shall do to all the far ^[Or "distant"] cities from you, which _are_ not from the cities of these nations located _nearby_. ^[Literally "here"]

But from the cities of these peoples that Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you as an inheritance, you shall not let anything live that breathes. ^[Or "is alive"]

###### v17
Rather, you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites ^[Hebrew "Hittite"] and the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] and the Perizzites, ^[Hebrew "Perizzite"] the Hivites, ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] and the Jebusites, ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"] _just_ as Yahweh your God has commanded you,

###### v18
so that they may not teach you to do like all their detestable things that they do for their gods and _thereby_ you sin against Yahweh your God.

###### v19
"If ^[Or "when"] you besiege a town _for_ many days to make war against it _in order to_ seize it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them, ^[Hebrew "it"] for you may eat from them, ^[Hebrew "it"] and _so_ you must not cut them ^[Hebrew "it"] down. Are the trees of the field humans that they should come in siege _against you_? ^[Literally "from your face"]

###### v20
Only ^[Or "But"] the trees ^[Hebrew "tree"] that you know _are not fruit trees_ ^[Literally "not a tree of food"] you may destroy and you may cut down, and you may build siege works against that city that is making war with you _until it falls_." ^[Literally "it to fall"]
