###### v1
"If someone slain is found in the land that Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you to take possession of it _and_ _is_ lying in the field, _and_ it is not known who _killed him_, ^[Literally "struck/smote him"]

###### v2
then your elders and your judges shall go out and shall measure _the distance_ to the cities that _are_ around the slain one.

###### v3
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it will happen"] the nearest city to the slain one, the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd that has not been worked with _in the field_, that has not pulled a yoke,

###### v4
and the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a _wadi that flows with water all year_ ^[Literally "an ever-flowing wadi"] and _that_ has not been plowed and has not been sown; _then_ _there they shall break the neck of the heifer in the wadi_. ^[Literally "they shall break there _the neck_ with respect to the heifer in the ever-flowing wadi"; the Hebrew verb carries the meaning "to break the neck of"]

###### v5
Then the priests, the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Levi, shall come near, for Yahweh your God has chosen them to bless in the name of Yahweh, and every legal dispute and every _case of_ assault will be _subject to their ruling_. ^[Literally "on their mouth"]

###### v6
And all of the elders of that city nearest to the slain person shall wash their hands over the heifer _with_ the broken neck in the wadi. ^[A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season]

###### v7
And they shall declare, and they shall say, 'Our hands did not shed this blood, and our eyes did not see _what was done_.

###### v8
Forgive your people, Israel, whom you redeemed, Yahweh, and _do_ not _allow_ ^[Literally "place/put"] the guilt of innocent blood in the midst of your people Israel, and let them be forgiven _with regard to_ blood.'

###### v9
And _so_ you shall purge the innocent blood from your midst, because you must do the right thing in the eyes of Yahweh.

###### v10
"When you go out for battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God gives them into your hand, and you lead the captives ^[Hebrew "his captive" but singular pronoun refers to the many captives taken with plural sense] away,

###### v11
and you see among the captives ^[Hebrew "captive"] a woman beautiful in appearance, and you become attached to her and you want to take her as _a_ wife,

###### v12
then you shall bring her into your household, and she shall shave her head, and she shall trim her nails.

###### v13
And she shall remove the clothing of her captivity from her, and she shall remain in your house, and she shall mourn her father and her mother _a full month_, ^[Literally "a month of days"] and after this _you may have sex with her_, ^[Literally "you may go into her"] and you may marry her, and she may _become your wife_. ^[Literally "become for you as wife"]

###### v14
And then if you do not take delight in her, then you shall let her go _to do whatever she wants_, ^[Literally "according to her desire/soul"] but you shall not treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored ^[Or "humbled"] her.

###### v15
"If a man has two wives, _and_ the one _is_ loved and the _other_ one _is_ disliked and the one loved and the one that is disliked have borne for him sons, if it happens _that_ the firstborn son _belongs to the one that is disliked_, ^[Literally "is to the wife who is hated"]

###### v16
_nevertheless_ _it will be the case that_ ^[Literally "it will happen"] on the day of bestowing his inheritance upon his sons, he will not be allowed to treat as _the_ firstborn son the son of the beloved _wife_ _in preference to_ ^[Literally "over the faces of"] the son of the disliked _wife_, _who is_ the firstborn _son_.

###### v17
But he shall acknowledge the firstborn son of the disliked _wife_ _by giving_ ^[Literally "to give"] him a double portion of _all that he has_, ^[Literally "all that is found for him"] for he _is_ the firstfruit of his vigor; ^[Or "the beginning of his strength"] to him _is_ the legal claim of the birthright. ^[Or "the just claim of the firstborn"]

###### v18
"_If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son_ ^[Literally "If shall be for a man, a son stubborn and rebellious"] _who_ _does not listen to_ ^[Literally "_and_ there is no listening/obedience"] the voice of his father and to the voice of his mother, and they discipline him, and he does not obey ^[Or "listen to"] them,

###### v19
then his father and his mother shall take hold of him, and they shall bring him out to the elders of his city and to the gate of his _town_, ^[Literally "place"]

###### v20
and they shall say to the elders of his city, 'This our son _is_ stubborn and rebellious; _he does not obey us_, ^[Literally "there is no listening to our voice"] _and_ he is a glutton and a drunkard.'

###### v21
Then all the men of his city shall stone him with stones and let him die; and so you shall purge the evil from your midst, and all of Israel will hear, and they will fear.

###### v22
"And _if a man commits a sin punishable by death_, ^[Literally "when shall be against a man a sin of judgment of death"] and _so_ he is put to death and you hang him on a tree,

###### v23
his dead body shall not hang on the tree, but certainly you shall bury him on that day, for cursed by God _is_ one that is _being_ hung; so you shall not defile your land ^[Or "ground"] that Yahweh your God _is_ giving to you _as an_ inheritance."
