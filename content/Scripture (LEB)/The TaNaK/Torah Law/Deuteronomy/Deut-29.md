###### v1
 ^[[[Deut-29|Deuteronomy 29:1–29]] in the English Bible is 28.69–29:28 in the Hebrew Bible] These _are_ the words of the covenant that Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] in the land of Moab _besides_ ^[Literally "from to alone"] the covenant that he made with them at Horeb.

###### v2
And Moses summoned all of Israel and said to them, "You saw all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt and to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land;

###### v3
_that is_, the great trials that your eyes saw, _and_ those great signs and wonders.

###### v4
But Yahweh has not given to you a heart to understand, or eyes to see, or ears to hear, _even_ _to this day_. ^[Literally "until the day the this"]

###### v5
And I have led you forty years ^[Hebrew "year"] in the desert; your clothes _have_ not worn out _on you_, ^[Literally "from on you"] and your sandal has not worn out _on your foot_. ^[Literally "from on your foot"]

###### v6
You have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine and strong drink, so that you may know that I _am_ Yahweh your God.

###### v7
And _when_ you came to this place _then_ Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out to meet you for battle, and we defeated them.

###### v8
And we took their land and gave it as _an_ inheritance to the Reubenites ^[Hebrew "Reubenite"] and to the Gadites ^[Hebrew "Gadite"] and to _the_ half-tribe of Manasseh.

###### v9
And _you must diligently observe the words of this covenant_, ^[Literally "you must keep the words of the covenant the this and you must do them"] so that you may succeed in all that you do.

###### v10
"You _are_ standing _today_, ^[Literally "the day"] all of you, _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] Yahweh your God, your leaders, your tribes, your elders, and your officials, all the men of Israel,

###### v11
your little children, your women and your aliens ^[Hebrew "alien"] who _are_ in the midst of your camp, from the choppers ^[Hebrew "chopper"] of your wood to the drawers ^[Hebrew "drawer"] of your water,

###### v12
_in order for you to enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God_, ^[Literally "for you to go over into the covenant of Yahweh your God"] and into ^[Or "with"] his oath that Yahweh your God _is_ _making with you_ ^[Literally "cutting with you"] _today_, ^[Literally "the day"]

###### v13
in order to establish you _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] _to himself_ ^[Literally "for him"] as a people and _so that_ he may be for you _as_ God, _just_ as he _promised_ ^[Literally "spoke"] to you and _just as_ ^[Literally "according to that which"] he swore to your ancestors, ^[Or "your fathers"] to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

###### v14
"Now I am not _making this covenant_ ^[Literally "cutting this covenant"] and this oath _with you alone_. ^[Literally "with you to alone you"]

###### v15
But with _whoever is standing here_ ^[Literally "with who he is here with us standing"] with us _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] Yahweh our God, and with _whoever is not standing here_ ^[Literally "with who he is not standing here with us"] with us _today_. ^[Literally "the day"]

###### v16
For you know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we traveled through the midst of the nations that you traveled ^[Or "journeyed"] through.

###### v17
And you have seen their detestable things and their idols of wood and stone, silver, and gold that _were_ among them,

###### v18
so that _there is not_ ^[Literally "lest there be/develop"] among you a man or a woman or a clan or a tribe _whose heart_ ^[Literally "his heart"] turns _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] from _being_ with Yahweh our God to go to serve the gods of these nations, so that there is not among you a root sprouting poison and wormwood.

###### v19
And then when he hears the words of this oath, then ^[Or "and"] _he will assure himself_ ^[Literally "he will bless himself"; HALOT 160 suggests "to consider oneself fortunate"] in his heart, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] '_Safety shall be mine even though I go in the stubbornness of my heart_,' ^[Literally "Peace shall happen/be for me, although/even if in the stubbornness of my heart I go"] thereby destroying the well-watered _land_ _along_ with the parched. ^[Some translators prefer to include the last clause as a part of the words of the wicked man (NASV vs. NEB)]

###### v20
Yahweh will not be willing to forgive him, for _by then_ the anger of Yahweh will smoke, and his passion against that man and all the curses written in this scroll will descend on him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under heaven.

###### v21
And Yahweh will single him out for calamity out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in the scroll of this law.

###### v22
"And the next generation, _that is_, your children who will rise _up_ after you, and the foreigner who will come from a distant land, when ^[Hebrew "and"] they will see the plagues of that land and its diseases that Yahweh has inflicted upon it, will say,

###### v23
'All its land is brimstone and salt left by fire, _none of its land will be sown_, ^[Literally "all of its land will not be sown"] and it will not make plants sprout out and it will not grow any vegetation; _it is_ as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Adman and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overturned in his anger and in his wrath.'

###### v24
And all the nations will say, '_Why_ ^[Literally "On what _basis_"] has Yahweh done _such a thing_ ^[Literally "so"] to this land? What _caused_ the fierceness of this great anger?'

###### v25
And they will say, ^[Or "answer/respond"] '_It is_ because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] which he _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] with them _when he brought them out_ ^[Literally "at/in his to bring them out from the land of Egypt"] from the land of Egypt.

###### v26
And they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods whom they did not know them and he ^[That is, Yahweh] had not allotted to them.

###### v27
So _the anger of Yahweh was kindled_ ^[Literally "became hot the nose of Yahweh"] against that land to bring upon it all the curses written in this scroll,

###### v28
and Yahweh uprooted them from their land in anger and in wrath and in great fury, and he cast them into another land, _just as it is today_.' ^[Literally "as the day the this"]

###### v29
"The hidden _things_ _belong to Yahweh_ ^[Literally "_are_ for Yahweh"] our God, but the revealed _things_ _belong to us_ ^[Literally "_are_ for us"] _to know_ and to our children _forever_, ^[Literally "until eternity"] _in order_ to do all the words of this law."
