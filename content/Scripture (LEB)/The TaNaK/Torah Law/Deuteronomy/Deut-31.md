###### v1
And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.

###### v2
And he said to them, "I am _a_ hundred and twenty years old _today_; ^[Literally "the day"] I am not able to go out and to come _in_ _any_ longer, and Yahweh said to me, 'You may not cross this Jordan.'

###### v3
Yahweh your God _is about to_ cross _before you_; ^[Literally "to the face of you"] he will destroy these nations _before you_, ^[Literally "to the face of you"] and you shall dispossess them. Joshua _will be_ crossing _before you_, ^[Literally "to the face of you"] _just_ as Yahweh _promised_. ^[Literally "spoke"]

###### v4
And Yahweh will do to them _just_ as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to their land, which he destroyed with them.

###### v5
And Yahweh _will deliver them to you before you_, ^[Literally "will give them Yahweh to the face of you"] and you shall do to them according to every commandment that I have commanded you.

###### v6
Be strong and be courageous; you should not be afraid, and you _should not be in dread from their presence_, ^[Literally "not you should dread from their face"] for Yahweh your God _is_ the _one_ going with you; he will not leave you alone and he will not forsake you."

###### v7
Then Moses summoned Joshua, and he said to him _in the presence of all Israel_, ^[Literally "before the eyes of all Israel"] "Be strong and be courageous, for you will go with this people into the land that Yahweh swore to their ancestors ^[Or "their fathers"] to give to them, and you will give it to them as an inheritance.

###### v8
Yahweh _is_ the _one_ going _before you_; ^[Literally "to the face of you"] he will be with you, and he will not leave you alone, and he will not forsake you; you shall not be afraid, and you shall not be discouraged."

###### v9
So Moses wrote this law, and he gave it to the priests, the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Levi, the _ones_ carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and to all the elders of Israel.

###### v10
Then Moses commanded them, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"] "At the end of seven years, in the time of the year for canceling debts during the Feast of Booths,

###### v11
_when all Israel comes to appear before_ ^[Literally "at/in the coming of all of Israel to see"] Yahweh their God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel _in their hearing_. ^[Literally "in their ears"]

###### v12
Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little children and your aliens that are in your _towns_, ^[Literally "gates"] so that they may hear and so that they may learn and they may revere Yahweh your God, and _they shall diligently observe_ ^[Literally "they shall keep to do"] all the words of this law.

###### v13
And _then_ their children, ^[Hebrew "child"] who have not known, they _too_ may hear, and they may learn to revere Yahweh their God all the days _that you live_ ^[Literally "that you are alive"] on the land that you _are_ crossing the Jordan _to get there_ ^[Literally "there"] to take possession of it."

###### v14
Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Look, _you are about to die_; ^[Literally "are near your days to die"] call Joshua and present yourselves in _the_ tent of assembly, ^[Or "meeting"] so that I may instruct him." So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in ^[Or "at"] _the_ tent of assembly. ^[Or "meeting"]

###### v15
And Yahweh appeared in the tent in a column of cloud, and the column of the cloud stood at the entrance of the tent.

###### v16
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Look, you _are_ about to lie _down_ with your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] and this people will arise and they ^[Hebrew "he"] will play the prostitute after _the foreign gods_ ^[Literally "the gods of the foreigner/foreign person of the land"] of the land _to which they are going_. ^[Literally "which he is going to"]

###### v17
And _my anger shall flare up against them_ ^[Literally "shall become my nose against it/him"] on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they ^[Hebrew "he"] shall become as prey, and disasters and troubles shall find ^[Or "encounter"] them, ^[Hebrew "him"] and they ^[Hebrew "he"] shall say on that day, '_Is it_ not because our ^[Hebrew "my" but represents all the people] God is not in our ^[Hebrew "my"] midst _that_ these disasters have found ^[Or "encountered"] us?' ^[Hebrew "me"]

###### v18
But I will certainly hide my face on that day, because _of_ all of the evil that they ^[Hebrew "he"] did because they ^[Hebrew "he"] turned to other gods.

###### v19
"And so then write this song for yourselves and teach it to the _Israelites_; ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] put it in their mouth, so that this song may be for me as a witness against the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v20
For when I bring them ^[Hebrew "him," referring to the people] into the land that I swore to their ^[Hebrew "his"] ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] a land flowing with milk and honey, _they will eat their fill_, ^[Literally "he will eat and he will be satisfied"] and they ^[Hebrew "he"] will become fat, and _then_ they ^[Hebrew "he"] will turn to other gods, and they will serve them, and they will spurn me, and they ^[Hebrew "he"] will break my covenant.

###### v21
_And then_ ^[Literally "And it shall happen"] many disasters and troubles will come upon them, ^[Hebrew "him"] and this song will give evidence before them ^[Hebrew "him"] as a witness, because it will not be forgotten from _out of_ the mouth of their descendants, ^[Hebrew "his offspring/descendant"] for I know their ^[Hebrew "his"] inclination that they ^[Hebrew "he"] _are_ having _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] before I have brought them ^[Hebrew "him"] into the land that I swore."

###### v22
And Moses wrote this song on that day and taught it _to_ the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v23
Then he ^[That is, Yahweh] told Joshua the son of Nun, and said _to him_, "Be strong and be courageous, for you shall bring the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] into the land that I swore to them, and I will be with you."

###### v24
_And then when Moses finished writing_ ^[Literally "And it happened as/when to finish Moses to write"] the words of this law on the scroll _until they were complete_, ^[Literally "until their to be complete/"]

###### v25
then Moses commanded the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v26
"Take the scroll of this law and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and it will be there as a witness against you.

###### v27
For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck _even now_ while I _am_ still alive with you _today_, ^[Literally "the day"] rebelling against Yahweh, and _how much more_ ^[Literally "and also for/indeed"] after my death.

###### v28
Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so that I may speak in their ears these words, and _that_ I may call as witness against them heaven and earth.

###### v29
For I know that after my death you will certainly act corruptly, and you will turn aside from the way that I have commanded you, and the disaster in the future days will befall you, because you will do evil ^[Hebrew "the evil"; the definite article indicates the general concept of evil] in the eyes of Yahweh, _provoking him with the work of your hands_." ^[Literally "to provoke him with/by the work of your hands"]

###### v30
So Moses spoke into the ears of the assembly of Israel the words of this song _until they were complete_. ^[Literally "until their to be complete"]
