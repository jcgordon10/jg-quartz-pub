[[Deut-31|Previous Chapter]] | [[Deut-33|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
"Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak,
and let the earth hear the words of my mouth.

###### v2
May my teaching trickle like the dew,
my words like rain showers on tender grass,
and like spring showers on new growth.

###### v3
For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh;
ascribe greatness to our God!

###### v4
The Rock, his work _is_ perfect,
for all his ways _are_ just;
_he is_ a faithful God, and _without injustice_; ^[Literally "there is not injustice"]
righteous and upright _is_ he.

###### v5
They _have_ behaved corruptly toward ^[Or "with"] him;
_they are_ not his children; _this is_ their flaw,
a generation crooked and perverse.

###### v6
_Like_ this do you treat Yahweh,
foolish and _unwise_ ^[Literally "not wise"] people?
_Has_ he not, your father, created you?
He made you, and he established you.

###### v7
Remember _the_ old days, _the years long past_; ^[Literally "_the_ years of _from_ generation to generation"]
ask your father, and he will inform you,
your elders and they will tell you. ^[Hebrew "to you"]

###### v8
_When the Most High apportioned_ ^[Literally "In/at the apportioning of the Most High"] _the_ nations,
at his dividing _up_ of the sons of humankind,
he fixed the boundaries of _the_ peoples,
according to the number of the children of Israel. ^[LXX reads "the number of the angels of God"; Dead Sea Scrolls reads "the number of the sons of God"]

###### v9
For Yahweh's portion _was_ his people,
Jacob the share of his inheritance.

###### v10
He found him in a desert land,
and in a howling, desert wasteland;
he _encircled him_, ^[Literally "moved around him"] he cared for him,
he protected him like the _apple_ ^[Literally "pupil"] of his eye.

###### v11
As an eagle stirs up its nest,
hovers over its young,
spreads out its wings, takes them, ^[Hebrew "it" but used poetically and with plural sense in context]
carries them ^[Hebrew "it" but used poetically and with plural sense in context] on its pinions, ^[Hebrew "pinion"]

###### v12
_so_ Yahweh alone guided him, ^[That is, Jacob, standing for Israel]
and _there was no foreign god accompanying him_. ^[Literally "and there was not with him a god foreign/strange"]

###### v13
And he set him on the high places of _the_ land,
and he fed _him_ the crops ^[Hebrew "crop"] of _the_ field,
and he nursed him with honey from crags, ^[Hebrew "crag"]
and _with_ oil from flinty rock,

###### v14
_With_ curds ^[Hebrew "curd"] from _the_ herd,
and _with_ milk from _the_ flock,
with _the_ fat of young rams,
and rams, the offspring of Bashan,
and with goats _along_ with the finest kernels of wheat,
and _from_ the blood of grapes ^[Hebrew "grape"] you drank fermented wine. ^[Or "partially fermented wine"; others translate simply as wine (NASB, NEB); HALOT 330, "still fermenting wine"]

###### v15
And Jeshurun grew fat, and he kicked;
you grew fat, you bloated, and you became obstinate;
and he abandoned God, his maker,
and he scoffed _at_ the rock of his salvation.

###### v16
They made him jealous with strange _gods_;
with detestable things they provoked him.

###### v17
They sacrificed to the demons, not God,
_to_ gods whom ^[Hebrew "them"] they had not known,
new _gods_ _who_ ^[Hebrew "they," understood in the verb form] came from recent times;
_their ancestors had not known them_. ^[Literally "their fathers not knew them"]

###### v18
_The_ rock who ^[Hebrew "he," understood in verb form] bore you, you neglected,
and you forgot God, _the one_ giving you birth.

###### v19
Then Yahweh saw, and he spurned _them_,
because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.

###### v20
So he said, 'I will hide my face from them;
I will see what _will be_ their end,
for they _are_ a generation of perversity,
_children in whom there is no faithfulness_. ^[Literally "sons not faithfulness _is_ in them"]

###### v21
They annoyed me with _what is_ not a god;
they provoked me with their idols.
So I will make them jealous with _those_ not a people,
with a foolish nation I will provoke them.

###### v22
For a fire was kindled ^[Or "ignited"] by my anger,
and it burned _up to the depths of Sheol_, ^[Literally "up to Sheol depths"]
and it devoured _the_ earth and its produce,
and it set afire the foundation of _the_ mountains.

###### v23
I will heap disasters upon them;
my arrows I will spend on them.

###### v24
_They will become_ weakened by famine,
and consumed by plague and bitter pestilence;
and the teeth of wild animals I will send against them,
with _the_ poison of _the_ creeping _things_ in _the_ dust;

###### v25
From outside _her boundaries_ the sword will make _her_ childless,
and from inside, terror;
both _for_ _the_ young man _and_ also the young woman,
the infant _along with_ the gray-headed man.

###### v26
I thought, "I will wipe them out;
_I will make people forget they ever existed_." ^[Literally "I will blot out from among human being their remembrance"]

###### v27
If I had not feared a provocation of _the_ enemy,
lest their foes might misunderstand,  ^[Or "so that they not make a false construal" of what has happened]
lest they should say,  ^[Or "so that they might not"] "Our hand is
_triumphant_, ^[Literally "raised/held high"] and Yahweh _did_ not do all this."'

###### v28
For _they are a nation void of sense_, ^[Literally "they a nation perishing of counsel"]
and there is not _any_ understanding in them.

###### v29
If only they were wise, they would understand this;
they would discern _for themselves their end_. ^[Literally "they would discern for end their"]

###### v30
How could one chase a thousand
and two could cause a myriad to flee,
if their Rock had not sold them,
and Yahweh had _not_ given them up?

###### v31
For the fact of the matter is,
their rock _is_ not like our Rock,
and our enemies recognize ^[The meaning of this expression is uncertain, but "discerns" or "judges" seem good choices; see HALOT 932, which allows for "judges" or "in the estimation of our enemies"] _this_.

###### v32
For their vine _is_ from the vine of Sodom,
and from the terraces of Gomorrah;
their grapes _are_ grapes of poison;
_their clusters are bitter_. ^[Literally "clusters of bitter _are_ for them"]

###### v33
Their wine _is_ the poison of snakes,
and _the_ deadly poison of horned vipers.

###### v34
'_Is_ not this stored up with me,
sealed in my treasuries?' ^[Or "storehouses]

###### v35
_Vengeance belongs to me_ ^[Literally "To me _is_ vengeance"] and _also_ recompense,
_for at the time their foot slips_, ^[Literally "at _the_ time _when_ it shall slip foot their"]
because the day of their disaster _is_ near,
_and fate comes quickly for them_.' ^[Literally "and comes quickly/hurries events to come to them"]

###### v36
For Yahweh will judge _on behalf of_ his people,
and concerning his servants;
he will change his mind when he sees that _their_ power has disappeared,
and _there is_ no one left, confined ^[Or "bond/bound"] or free. ^[Or "freed"]

###### v37
And he will say, 'Where _are_ their gods,
_their_ rock in whom ^[Hebrew "in him"] they took refuge?

###### v38
Who ate the fat of their sacrifices
_and_ drank the wine of their libations?
Let them rise _up_, and let them help you;
_Let them be to you a refuge_. ^[Literally "let there be/him/them unto you _as_ a shelter"]

###### v39
See, now, that I, _even_ I _am_ he,
and there is not a god besides me;
I put to death and I give life;
I wound and I heal;
there is not _one_ who delivers from my hand!

###### v40
For _indeed_ I lift up my hand to heaven,
And I promise _as I live forever_, ^[Literally "live I to eternity"]

###### v41
When I sharpen ^[Or "have sharpened"] _my flashing sword_, ^[Literally "the flashing of my sword"]
and my hand takes hold ^[Or "seizes"] _of it_ in judgment,
_I will take reprisals against my foes_, ^[Literally "I will let return vengeance to foes my"]
and my haters I will repay.

###### v42
I will make my arrows drunk with blood,
and my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain,
and captives ^[Hebrew "captive"] from the heads ^[Hebrew "head"] of the leaders of _the_ enemy.'

###### v43
Call for songs of joy, O nations, _concerning_ his people, ^[Dead Sea Scrolls reads: "Rejoice, O heavenly ones, with him! Bow down, all you gods, before him!"]
for the blood of his servants he will avenge,
_and he will take reprisals against his foes_, ^[Literally "vengeance he will let return to his foes"]
and he will make atonement _for_ his land, his people."

###### v44
And Moses came, and he spoke ^[Or "recited"] all the words of this song in the ears of the people; _that is_, he and Joshua the son of Nun.

###### v45
_And when Moses finished speaking_ ^[Literally "And _he_ finished Moses to speak"] all these words to all Israel,

###### v46
then he said to them, "_Take to heart all the words_ ^[Literally "Put heart your to all the words"] that I _am_ admonishing _against_ you _today_ ^[Literally "the day"] _concerning_ which you should instruct them _with respect to_ your children ^[Or "sons"] _so that they will observe diligently_ ^[Literally "to keep to do"] all the words of this law,

###### v47
for it _is_ not a trifling matter among you, but it _is_ your life, and through this word _you will live long in the land_ ^[Literally "you will make long days on the land"] that you _are about_ to cross the Jordan _to get_ there to take possession of it."

###### v48
And Yahweh said to Moses on exactly this day, _saying_, ^[Literally "to say"]

###### v49
"Go up to this mountain of the Abarim _range_, Mount Nebo, which _is_ _opposite Jericho_, ^[Literally "on the face of Jericho"] and see the land of Canaan that I _am_ giving to the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] as _a_ possession.

###### v50
You shall die on that mountain that you _are_ about to go up there, and _you will_ be gathered to your people, _just_ as your brother Aaron died on _Mount Hor_ ^[Literally "on Hor the mountain"] and he was gathered to his people,

###### v51
because _of the fact_ that you broke faith with me in the midst of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, _in_ the desert of Zin, because _you did not treat me as holy_ ^[Literally "that not you treated me as holy"] in the midst of the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v52
Yes, from afar you may view the land, but there you shall not enter there, _that is_, into the land that I _am_ giving to the _Israelites_." ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]
