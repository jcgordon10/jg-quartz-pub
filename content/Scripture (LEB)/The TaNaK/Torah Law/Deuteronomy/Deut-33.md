[[Deut-32|Previous Chapter]] | [[Deut-34|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Now ^[Or "And"] this _is_ the blessing _with_ which Moses, the man of God, blessed the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] _before_ ^[Literally "to the face of"] his death.

###### v2
Then ^[Or "And"] he said,
"Yahweh came from Sinai,
and he dawned upon them from Seir;
he shone forth from Mount Paran,
and he came with myriads of holy ones,
at his right hand a fiery law for them. ^[This pointing of the MT is very difficult; here HALOT 93 suggests "fire a law for them" as a translation of the compound Hebrew word made up of "fire" + "law," which I render as "_a_ fiery law"]

###### v3
Moreover, ^[Or "Indeed"] _he loves his people_, ^[Literally "a lover of peoples"]
all the holy ones _were_ in your hand,
and they bowed down to ^[Or "at"] your feet,
_each one accepted directions from you_. ^[Literally "he takes up from your words"]

###### v4
A law Moses instructed for us,
_as a_ possession _for_ the assembly of Jacob.

###### v5
And _then_ a king arose in Jeshurun,
at the gathering of the leaders of _the_ people,
_united were the tribes of Israel_. ^[Literally "together the tribes of Israel"]

###### v6
"May Reuben live, and may he not die,
_and let his number not be few_." ^[Literally "let he be his people _of_ number"]

###### v7
_And he said this of Judah_, ^[Literally "and this concerning/to Judah, and he said"]
"Hear, O Yahweh, the voice of Judah,
and bring him to his people;
his own hands strive ^[Or "is/are great" on his behalf] for him,
and may you be a help _against_ ^[Literally "from"] his foes."

###### v8
And of Levi he said,
"Your Thummim and your Urim
_are_ for _your faithful one_, ^[Literally "man, your faithful one"]
_whom you tested at Massah_; ^[Literally "whom you tested him at Massah"]
you contended _with_ him
at the waters of Meribah.

###### v9
The _one_ saying of his father and of his mother,
'I have not regarded them,'
and his brothers he _did_ not acknowledge,
and his children ^[Or "sons"] _he did_ not know,
but _rather_ they observed your word,
and your covenant they kept.

###### v10
They taught ^[Or "teach/will teach"] your regulations to Jacob,
and your law to Israel;
they placed incense smoke _before you_, ^[Literally "in your nose"]
and whole burnt offerings on your altar.

###### v11
Bless, O Yahweh, his substance,
and with the work of his hands you must be pleased;
smite the loins of those who attack him,
and those hating him, _so that they cannot arise_." ^[Literally "so that not they stand up"]

###### v12
Of Benjamin he said,
"The beloved of Yahweh dwells _securely_, ^[Literally "in confidence"]
the Most High ^[This is the most likely reading in context (Most High God). Literally the Hebrew text reads "upon him," so the NASV translates the first line as: dwell in security "by him"] shields _all_ around him,
all the day,
and between his shoulders he dwells."

###### v13
And of Joseph he said,
"Blessed by Yahweh _is_ his land,
with ^[Hebrew "from"] the choice things of heaven,
with ^[Hebrew "from"] dew, and with ^[Hebrew "from"] the deep lying down beneath,

###### v14
and with ^[Hebrew "from"] _the_ choice things of _the_ fruits ^[Or "produce of"] of the _the_ sun,
and with the choice things of _the_ yield of _the_ _seasons_, ^[Literally "months"]

###### v15
and with ^[Hebrew "from"] the finest things of _the_ ancient mountains,
and with ^[Hebrew "from"] _the_ choice things of _the_ _eternal hills_, ^[Literally "_the_ hills of eternity _never ending ages_"]

###### v16
and with ^[Hebrew "from"] the choice things of _the_ earth and its fullness,
and the favor of _the one_ _who dwelt_ ^[Literally "dwells" but context puts the event into the past; literally "dweller of the bush"] in _the_ bush. ^[Some scholars suggest that this expression must be read as: on Sinai]
Let them come to the head of Joseph,
and to the crown of the prince among his brothers.

###### v17
_As_ the firstborn of his ox, majesty _belongs to him_, ^[Literally "is for him"]
and his horns _are_ _the_ horns of a wild ox;
with them he drives people together, ^[Or "all at once" (NASB)]
and they _are_ the myriads of Ephraim,
and they _are_ the thousands of Manasseh."

###### v18
And of Zebulun he said,
"Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out,
and _rejoice_, Issachar, in your tents;

###### v19
They summon people _to the_ mountains; ^[Hebrew "mountain"]
there they sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness,
because the affluence of _the_ seas they suck _out_,
and _the most hidden treasures of the sand_." ^[Literally "_the_ covered of _the_ hidden of _the_ sand"]

###### v20
And of Gad he said,
"Blessed _be_ _the one who enlarges Gad_; ^[Literally "the enlarger of Gad"]
like a lion he dwells,
and he tears an arm as well as a scalp.

###### v21
And he selected ^[Or "provided"] _the_ best _part_ for himself,  ^[Hebrew "for him"]
for there _the_ portion of a ruler _is_ included,
and he came _with the_ heads of _the_ people; ^[Or possibly, "the heads of the people came/assembled" (compare NEB)]
he did ^[Or "worked"] the righteousness of Yahweh,
and his regulations for Israel."

###### v22
And of Dan he said,
"Dan _is_ a cub of _a_ lion;
he leaps from Bashan." ^[Hebrew "the Bashan," referring to a well-known geographical and agricultural area]

###### v23
And of Naphtali, he said,
"Oh, Naphtali, sated of favor,
and full of the blessing of Yahweh;
take possession of _the_ lake,
and _the land to the_ south."

###### v24
And of Asher he said,
"Blessed _more than sons_ ^[Literally "blessed from/of sons _is_" features the comparative use the Hebrew preposition _min_, "than"] _is_ Asher;
_may he be the favorite_ ^[Literally "may he be favored"] of his brothers,
_dipping his feet in the oil_. ^[Literally "and dipping in _the_ oil his feet"]

###### v25
Your bars _are_ ^[Or "will be"] iron and bronze,

The God of _ancient time_ ^[Literally "before/earlier time_s_"] _is_ a hiding place,
and underneath _are_ _the_ arms of eternity, ^[Or "everlasting ages" or "everlasting arms"]
and he drove out _from before_ ^[Literally "from your face"] you your enemy,
and he said, 'Destroy _them_!'

###### v28
So Israel dwells alone _and_ carefree,
the spring of Jacob in a land of grain and wine;
his heavens even drip dew.

###### v29
Blessed _are_ you, O Israel.
Who is like you, a people who _is_ saved by Yahweh,
the shield of your help,
and who _is_ the sword of your triumph,
and your enemies, they shall fawn before you, ^[Hebrew "to you"]
and you shall tread on their backs."
