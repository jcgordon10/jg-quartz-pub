[[Exod-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
And these _are_ the names of the sons of Israel who came _to_ Egypt; with Jacob, they each came with his _family_: ^[Literally "house"]

###### v2
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;

###### v3
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;

###### v4
Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.

###### v5
And _all those who descended from Jacob_ ^[Literally "every soul/individual/life, the ones going out from the loins of Jacob"] were seventy individuals, ^[Or "souls," "lives"] and Joseph was in Egypt.

###### v6
And Joseph died and all of his brothers and all of that generation.

###### v7
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] were fruitful and multiplied and were many and were very, very numerous, and the land was filled with them.

###### v8
And a new king rose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.

###### v9
And he said to his people, "Look, the people of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] _are_ greater and more numerous than us.

###### v10
Come, we must deal shrewdly with them, lest they become many, and when war happens, they also will join our enemies and will fight against us and go up from the land."

###### v11
And they appointed commanders of forced labor over them in order to oppress them with their _forced labor_, ^[Literally "burdens" or "burdensome labor"] and they built storage cities for Pharaoh--Pithom and Rameses.

###### v12
And as he oppressed them, so they became many, and so they spread out, and _the Egyptians_ were afraid because of the presence of the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v13
And the Egyptians ruthlessly compelled the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] to work.

###### v14
And they made their lives bitter with hard work with mortar and with bricks and with all _sorts_ of work in the field--with all their work in which they ruthlessly enslaved them.

###### v15
And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives--of whom the name of the one _was_ Shiphrah and the name of the second _was_ Puah--

###### v16
and he said, "When you help the Hebrews give birth, you will look upon the pairs of testicles; if he _is_ a son, you will put him to death, and if she _is_ a daughter, she will live."

###### v17
But the midwives feared God, and they did not do as the king of Egypt had said to them. They let the boys live.

###### v18
And the king of Egypt summoned the midwives, and he said to them, "Why have you done this thing and let the boys live?"

###### v19
And the midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew _women are_ not like the Egyptian women, because they _are_ vigorous; before the midwife comes to them, they have given birth."

###### v20
And God did the midwives good, and the _Israelite_ people became many and were very numerous.

###### v21
_And so_ ^[Literally "and he/it was"] because the midwives feared God, he gave them _families_. ^[Literally "houses"]

###### v22
And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "Every son who is born you will throw into the Nile, and every daughter you will let live."
