###### v1
And a man from the _family_ ^[Literally "house"] of Levi went, and he took _a descendent of Levi_. ^[Literally "daughter of Levi"]

###### v2
And the woman conceived, and she gave birth to a son, and she saw him, that he was a fine baby, and she hid him three months.

###### v3
But when she could no longer hide him, she got a papyrus basket for him, and she coated it with tar and with pitch, and she placed the boy in it, and she placed _it_ among the reeds on the bank of the Nile.

###### v4
And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him.

###### v5
And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to wash at the Nile, _while_ her maidservants were walking alongside the Nile, and she saw the basket in the midst of the reeds, and she sent her slave woman _for it_ and took it

###### v6
and opened _it_ and saw him--the boy--and it was a lad weeping, and she had compassion for him and said, "This _must be_ from the boys of the Hebrews." ^[Each instance of the implied "she" in verses 5 and 6 is the daughter of Pharaoh]

###### v7
And his sister said to the daughter of Pharaoh, "Shall I go and call for you a woman from the Hebrews _who is_ nursing _so that_ she will nurse the boy for you?"

###### v8
And the daughter of Pharaoh said to her, "Go." And the girl went, and she called the mother of the boy.

###### v9
And the daughter of Pharaoh said, "Take this boy and nurse him for me, and I myself will give you wages, and the woman took the boy, and she nursed him.

###### v10
And the boy grew, and she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh, and he became her son, and she called his name Moses, and she said, "Because I drew him out from the water."

###### v11
_And then_ ^[Literally "and he/it was"] in those days when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers, and he saw their _forced labor_, ^[Literally "burdens" or "burdensome labor"] and he saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man, _one of_ his brothers. ^[Or "a Hebrew man from his brothers"]

###### v12
And he turned here and there, and he saw no one, ^[Literally "and he saw that there was not a man"] and he struck the Egyptian, and he hid him in the sand.

###### v13
And he went out on the second day, and there were two Hebrew men fighting, and he said to the guilty _one_, "Why do you strike your neighbor?"

###### v14
And he said, "Who _appointed you as a commander_ ^[Literally "put you for a man, a commander" or "placed you for a man, a commander"] and a judge over us? _Are_ you intending to kill me like you killed the Egyptian?" And Moses was afraid, and he said, "Surely the matter has become known."

###### v15
And Pharaoh heard this matter, and he sought to kill Moses, and Moses fled from Pharaoh, and he lived in the land of Midian, and he lived at _a certain well_. ^[Literally "the well"]

###### v16
_Now_ the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. ^[The Hebrew noun translated "flock" is used here and in verses 17 and 19 collectively for sheep or goats or a mix of the two]

###### v17
And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.

###### v18
And they came to Reuel, their father, and he said, "_Why have you come so quickly_ ^[Literally "why did you hasten coming"] today?"

###### v19
And they said, "An Egyptian man delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he even drew _water_ for us and watered the flock."

###### v20
And he said to his daughters, "Where _is_ he? _Why then_ ^[Literally "why this"] have you left the man? _Call him so that he can eat some food_." ^[Literally "call to _or "summon/invite"_ him and he will eat bread"]

###### v21
And Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses.

###### v22
And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom because he said, "I am an alien in a foreign land." ^[The word translated "alien" sounds like the first syllable in the name Gershom. The second syllable sounds like the word for "there"]

###### v23
_And then_ ^[Literally "and he/it was"] during those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] groaned because of the work, and they cried out, and their cry for help because of the work went up to God.

###### v24
And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob,

###### v25
and God saw the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and God took notice. ^[Or "and God knew"]
