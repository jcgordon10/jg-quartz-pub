###### v1
And Moses was a shepherd with the flock ^[The Hebrew noun translated "flock" in this verse is used collectively for sheep or goats or a mix of the two.] of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the west _of_ the desert, and he came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.

###### v2
And the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush, and he looked, and there was the bush burning with fire, but the bush was not being consumed.

###### v3
And Moses said, "Let me turn aside and see this great sight. Why does the bush not burn up?"

###### v4
And Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him from the midst of the bush, and he said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here I _am_."

###### v5
And he said, "You must not come near to here. Take off your sandals from on your feet, because the place on which you _are_ standing, it _is_ holy ground."

###### v6
And he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face because he was afraid of looking at God.

###### v7
And Yahweh said, "Surely I have seen the misery of my people who _are_ in Egypt, and I have heard their cry of distress because of their oppressors, for I know their sufferings.

###### v8
And I have come down to deliver them from the hand of _the_ Egyptians and to bring them up from this land to a good and wide land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] and the Hittites ^[Hebrew "Hittite"] and the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] and the Perizzites ^[Hebrew "Perizzite"] and the Hivites ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] and the Jebusites. ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"]

###### v9
And now, look, the cry of distress of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] has come to me, and also I see the oppression _with_ which _the_ Egyptians _are_ oppressing them.

###### v10
And now come, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and _you must_ bring my people, the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] out from Egypt."

###### v11
But Moses said to God, "Who _am_ I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] out from Egypt?"

###### v12
And he said, "Because I am with you, and this _will be_ the sign for you that I myself have sent you: When you bring the people out from Egypt, you will serve God on this mountain."

###### v13
But Moses said to God, "Look, _if_ I go to the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and I say to them, 'The God of your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] has sent me to you,' and they say to me, 'What _is_ his name?' _then_ what shall I say to them?"

###### v14
And God said to Moses, "I am that I am." And he said, "So you must say to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] 'I am sent me to you.'"

###### v15
And God said again to Moses, "So you must say to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] 'Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This _is_ my name forever, and this _is_ my remembrance from generation _to_ generation.'

###### v16
Go and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, 'Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, "I have carefully attended to you and what has been done to you in Egypt."

###### v17
And I said, "I will bring you up from the misery of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] and the Hittites ^[Hebrew "Hittite"] and the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] and the Perizzites ^[Hebrew "Perizzite"] and the Hivites ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] and the Jebusites, ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"] to a land flowing with milk and honey."'

###### v18
And they will listen to your voice, and you will go, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews has met with us, and now let us please go _on_ a journey of three days into the desert, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh our God.'

###### v19
But I myself know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go _unless compelled by a strong hand_. ^[Literally "and not with a strong hand"]

###### v20
And I will stretch out my hand, and I will strike Egypt with all of my wonders that I will do in its midst, and _afterward_ ^[Literally "after so" or "after _I do_ so"] he will release you.

###### v21
And I will give this people favor in the eyes of _the_ Egyptians, _and then_ ^[Literally "and he/it will be"] when you go, you will not go empty-handed.

###### v22
And a woman will ask from her neighbor and from the woman dwelling as an alien in her house _for_ objects of silver and objects of gold and garments, and you will put _them_ on your sons and on your daughters; and you will plunder Egypt."
