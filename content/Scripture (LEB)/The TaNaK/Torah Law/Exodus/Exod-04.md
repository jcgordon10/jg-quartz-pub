###### v10
And Moses said to Yahweh, "Please, Lord, I _am_ not a man of words, _neither recently nor in the past nor since your speaking_ ^[Literally "also from yesterday also from the day before also from then your speaking"] to your servant, because I _am_ heavy of mouth and of tongue."

So then go, and I myself will be with your mouth, and I will teach you what you must speak."
