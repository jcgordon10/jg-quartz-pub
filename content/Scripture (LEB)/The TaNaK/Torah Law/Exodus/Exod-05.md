###### v1
And afterward, Moses and Aaron went, and they said to Pharaoh, "Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, 'Release my people so that they may hold a festival for me in the desert.'"

###### v2
And Pharaoh said, "Who is Yahweh that I should listen to his voice to release Israel? I do not know Yahweh, and also I will not release Israel."

###### v3
And they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go _on_ a three-day journey into the desert, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh our God, lest he strike us with plague or with sword."

###### v4
And the king of Egypt said, "Why, Moses and Aaron, do you take ^[Or "let loose," "let run wild" (compare 32:25)] the people from their work? Go to your _forced labor_!" ^[Literally "burdens" or "burdensome labor"]

###### v5
And Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land _are_ now many, and you want to stop them from their _forced labor_." ^[Literally "burdens" or "burdensome labor"]

###### v6
And on that day Pharaoh commanded the slave drivers over the people and his foremen, saying,

###### v7
"You must no longer give straw to the people to make the bricks like _before_. ^[Literally "yesterday three days ago"] Let them go and gather straw for themselves.

###### v8
But the quota of the bricks that they _were_ making _before_ ^[Literally "yesterday three days ago"] _you must require of them_. ^[Literally "you will put on them"] You must not reduce from it, because they _are_ lazy. Therefore they _are_ crying out, saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'

###### v9
Let the work be heavier on the men so that they will do it and not pay attention to words of deception."

###### v10
And the slave drivers of the people and their foremen went out, and they spoke to the people, saying, "Thus says Pharaoh, 'I _am_ not giving you straw.

###### v11
You go, get straw for yourselves from whatever you find because not a thing is being reduced from your work.'"

###### v12
And the people spread out in all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for the straw.

###### v13
And the slave drivers _were_ insisting, saying, "Finish your work _for each day_ ^[Literally "a thing of a day"] on its day, as _when there was straw_." ^[Literally "in the being of the straw"]

###### v14
And the foremen of the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] whom Pharaoh's slave drivers had appointed over them, were beaten _by men who were_ saying, "Why have you not completed your portion of brickmaking _as before, both yesterday and today_?" ^[Literally "as yesterday three days ago also yesterday also the day"]

###### v15
And the foremen of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you treat your servants like this?

###### v16
Straw _is_ not being given to your servants, but _they are_ saying to us, 'Make bricks!' and, look, your servants _are_ being beaten, but it is the fault of ^[The expression is difficult. The word translated "fault" or "sin" has pointing for a second-person feminine singular subject ("you sinned"), which does not go well with either "Pharaoh" or "your people" as a subject; but the noun translated "sin of" has the same consonants, leading to the possibility that the word should be understood as a noun] your people."

###### v17
And he said, "You _are_ lazy, lazy! Therefore you _are_ saying, 'Let us go; let us sacrifice to Yahweh.'

###### v18
And now go, work, but straw will not be given to you, and you must give the full quota of bricks."

###### v19
And the foremen of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] saw they were in trouble _with the saying_, ^[Literally "saying"] "You will not reduce from your bricks _for each day_ ^[Literally "a thing of a day"] on its day."

###### v20
And they met Moses and Aaron, _who were_ waiting to meet them when they _were_ going out from Pharaoh.

###### v21
And they said to them, "May Yahweh look upon you and judge because you have caused our fragrance to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants _so as_ to put a sword into their hand to kill us."

###### v22
And Moses returned to Yahweh and said, "Lord, why have you brought trouble to this people? Why ever did you send me?

###### v23
And from the time I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble to this people, and you have certainly not delivered your people."
