###### v1
And Yahweh said to Moses, "See, I have made you _as_ a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother will be your prophet.

###### v2
You will speak all that I will command you, and Aaron your brother will speak to Pharaoh, and he will release the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] from his land.

###### v3
And I myself will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and I will make my signs and my wonders numerous in the land of Egypt.

###### v4
And Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will put my hand into Egypt and bring out my divisions, my people, the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] from the land of Egypt with great punishments.

###### v5
And _the_ Egyptians will know that I _am_ Yahweh when I stretch out my hand over Egypt and bring the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] out from their midst."

###### v6
And Moses and Aaron did _it_; as Yahweh commanded them, so they did.

###### v7
(And Moses _was_ _eighty years old_, ^[Literally "a son of eighty year"] and Aaron _was_ _eighty-three years old_ ^[Literally "a son of three and eighty year"] when they spoke to Pharaoh.)

###### v8
And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

###### v9
"When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Do a wonder for yourselves,' you will say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it before Pharaoh, and it will become a snake.'"

###### v10
And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Yahweh had commanded. And Aaron threw his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a snake.

###### v11
And Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did likewise with their secret arts.

###### v12
Each threw down his staff, and they became snakes, and Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.

###### v13
And Pharaoh's heart was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had said.

###### v14
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart _is_ _insensitive_; ^[Literally "heavy"] he refuses to release the people.

###### v15
Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Look, _he is_ going out to the water, and you must wait to meet him on the bank of the Nile, and you must take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.

###### v16
And you must say to him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, "Release my people that they may serve me in the desert, and, look, you have not listened until now."

###### v17
Thus says Yahweh, "By this you will know that I _am_ Yahweh. Look, I _am about to_ strike with the staff that is in my hand the water that is in the Nile, and it will be changed to blood.

###### v18
And the fish that _are_ in the Nile will die, and the Nile will stink, and _the_ Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the Nile."'"

###### v19
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch your hand out over the waters of Egypt and over their rivers, over their canals, and over their pools and over all of their reservoirs of water, so that they become blood,' and blood will be in all the land of Egypt and in _vessels of_ wood and of stone."

###### v20
And Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh had commanded, and he raised the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile before the eyes of Pharaoh and before the eyes of his servants, and all of the water that was in the Nile was changed to blood.

###### v21
And the fish that _were_ in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, and _the_ Egyptians were not able to drink water from the Nile, and the blood was in all the land of Egypt.

###### v22
And the magicians of Egypt did likewise with their secret arts, and Pharaoh's heart was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken.

###### v23
And Pharaoh turned and went to his house, and _he did not take also this to heart_. ^[Literally "he did not put his heart also to this"]

###### v24
And all of _the_ Egyptians dug around the Nile _for_ water to drink, because they were unable to drink from the water of the Nile.

###### v25
And seven days passed after Yahweh struck the Nile.
