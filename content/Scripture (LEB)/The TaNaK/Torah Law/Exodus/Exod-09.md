###### v1
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, "Release my people so that they may serve me."

###### v2
But if you _are_ refusing to release and you still _are_ keeping hold of them,

###### v3
look, the hand of Yahweh _is_ about to be _present with_ a very _severe_ ^[Literally "heavy"] plague on your livestock that are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the cattle, and on the sheep and goats.

###### v4
But Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and not a thing will die from all _that belongs_ to the _Israelites_.'" ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v5
And Yahweh set an appointed time, saying, "Tomorrow Yahweh will do this thing in the land."

###### v6
And Yahweh did this thing the next day; all the livestock of Egypt died, but from the livestock of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] not one died.

###### v7
And Pharaoh sent _to check_, and _it turned out_ ^[Literally "look"] not even one from the livestock of Israel had died, but Pharaoh's heart was _insensitive_, ^[Literally "heavy"] and he did not release the people.

###### v8
And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take for yourselves full handfuls of soot from a smelting furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heavens before the eyes of Pharaoh.

###### v9
And it will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and it will become on humans and on animals a skin sore sprouting blisters in all the land of Egypt."

###### v10
And they took the soot of the smelting furnace, and they stood before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it toward the heavens, and it became skin sores sprouting blisters on humans and on animals.

###### v11
And the magicians were not able to stand before Moses because of the skin sores, for the skin sores were on the magicians and on all _the_ Egyptians.

###### v12
And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.

###### v13
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Start early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Look, _he is_ going out to the water, and you must say to him, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, "Release my people so that they may serve me.

###### v14
For at this time I _am_ sending all of my plagues _to you personally_ ^[Literally "to your heart," that is, in a way designed to receive attention] and among your servants and among your people so that you will know that there is no one like me in all the earth.

###### v15
For now I could have stretched out my hand, and I could have struck you and your people with the plague, and you would have perished from the earth.

###### v16
But for the sake of this I have caused you to stand--for the sake of showing you my strength and in order to proclaim my name in all the earth.

###### v17
Still you _are_ behaving haughtily to my people by not releasing them.

###### v18
Look, about _this_ time tomorrow, I _am_ going to cause very severe ^[Literally "heavy"] hail to rain, the like of which has not been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.

###### v19
And now send _word_; bring into safety your livestock and all that _belongs_ to you in the field. The hail will come down on every human and animal that is found in the field and not gathered into the house, and they will die."'"

###### v20
Anyone from the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of Yahweh caused his servants and livestock to flee to the houses.

###### v21
But whoever did not _give regard to_ ^[Literally "put his heart to"] the word of Yahweh abandoned his servants and his livestock in the field.

###### v22
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand to the heavens, and let there be hail in all the land of Egypt, on human and on animal and on all the vegetation of the field in the land of Egypt."

###### v23
And Moses stretched out his staff to the heavens, and Yahweh gave thunder ^[The word often translated "voice" or "sound" is also used to describe thunder, as in this chapter] and hail, and fire went _to the_ earth, and Yahweh caused hail to rain on the land of Egypt.

###### v24
And there was hail, and fire _was_ flashing back and forth in the midst of the very severe hail, the like of which was not in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.

###### v25
And the hail struck in all the land of Egypt all that _was_ in the field, from human to animal, and the hail struck all the vegetation of the field and smashed every tree of the field.

###### v26
Only in the land of Goshen, where the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] _were_, there was no hail.

###### v27
And Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them, "I have sinned this time. Yahweh _is_ the righteous _one_, and I and my people _are_ the wicked _ones_.

###### v28
Pray to Yahweh. The thunder of God and hail _are enough_, ^[Literally "much/great from the being of the voices/thunder"] and I will release you, and _you will no longer have to stay_." ^[Literally "you will not add to stand/remain"]

###### v29
And Moses said to him, "At my leaving the city, I will spread out my hands to Yahweh. The thunder will stop, and the hail will be no more, so that you will know that the earth _belongs_ to Yahweh.

###### v30
But _as for_ you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the presence of Yahweh God."

###### v31
And the flax and the barley were struck, because the barley _was in the_ ear and the flax _was in_ bud.

###### v32
But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, because they _are_ late-ripening.

###### v33
And Moses went from Pharaoh out of the city, and he spread his hands to Yahweh, and the thunder and the hail stopped, and rain did not pour _on the_ earth.

###### v34
And Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder stopped, and _he again sinned_ ^[Literally "he added to sin"] and made his heart _insensitive_, ^[Literally "he made his heart heavy"] he and his servants.

###### v35
And Pharaoh's heart was hard, and he did not release the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] as Yahweh had said _by the agency of Moses_. ^[Literally "by the hand of Moses"]
