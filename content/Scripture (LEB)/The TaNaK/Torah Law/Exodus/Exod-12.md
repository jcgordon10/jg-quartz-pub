###### v1
And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

###### v2
"This month _will be_ the beginning of months; it _will be_ for you the first of the months of the year.

###### v3
Speak to all the community of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth of this month, they will each take for themselves _a lamb for the family_, ^[Literally "a lamb/kid for the house of fathers." The word translated "lamb" refers to a small livestock animal and could be either a young sheep or a young goat] a lamb for the household.

###### v4
And if the household is too small for a lamb, he and the neighbor nearest to his house will take _one_ according to the number of persons; ^[Or "the number of selves"] you will count out portions of the lamb _according to how much each one can eat_. ^[Literally "a man for the mouth of his eating"]

###### v5
The lamb for you must be a male, without defect, in its first year; you will take _it_ from the sheep or from the goats.

###### v6
"_You will keep it_ ^[Literally "It will be for you for observation"] until the fourteenth day of this month, and all the assembly of the community of Israel will slaughter it _at twilight_. ^[Literally "between the evenings"]

###### v7
And they will take _some_ of the blood and put _it_ on the two doorposts and on the lintel on the houses in which they eat it.

###### v8
And they will eat the meat on this night; they will eat it fire-roasted and _with_ unleavened bread on _bitter herbs_. ^[Literally "bitter _things_"]

###### v9
You must not eat any of it raw or boiled, boiled in the water, but rather roasted with fire, its head with its legs and with its inner parts.

###### v10
And you must not leave any of it until morning; anything left from it until morning you must burn in the fire.

###### v11
And this is how you will eat it--_with_ your waists fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand, and you will eat it in haste. It _is_ Yahweh's Passover.

###### v12
"And I will go through the land of Egypt during this night, and I will strike all of the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from human to animal, and I will do punishments among all of the gods of Egypt. I _am_ Yahweh.

###### v13
And the blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and I will see the blood, and I will pass over you, and there will not be a destructive plague among you when I strike the land of Egypt.

###### v14
"And this day will become a memorial for you, and you will celebrate it as a religious feast for Yahweh throughout your generations; you will celebrate it as a lasting statute.

###### v15
You will eat unleavened bread for seven days. Surely on the first day you shall remove yeast from your houses, because anyone _who_ eats _food with_ yeast from the first day until the seventh day--that person will be cut off from Israel.

###### v16
It will be for you on the first day a holy assembly ^[Or "summons," "convocation"] and on the seventh day a holy assembly; ^[Or "summons," "convocation"] no work will be done on them; only what is eaten by every person, it alone will be prepared for you.

###### v17
"And you will keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because on this very day I brought out your divisions from the land of Egypt, and you will keep this day for your generations as a lasting statute.

###### v18
On the first _day_, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, you will eat unleavened bread until the evening of the twenty-first day of the month.

###### v19
For seven days yeast must not be found in your houses, because _anyone eating food with yeast_ ^[Literally "anyone eating yeasted food, that person"] will be cut off from the community of Israel--_whether_ an alien or a native of the land.

###### v20
You will eat no _food with_ yeast; in all of your dwellings you will eat unleavened bread."

###### v21
And Moses called all the elders of Israel, and he said to them, "Select and take for yourselves sheep for your clans and slaughter the Passover sacrifice.

###### v22
And take a bunch of hyssop and dip _it_ into the blood that _is_ in the basin and apply _some_ of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts. And you will not go out, anyone from the doorway of his house, until morning.

###### v23
And Yahweh will go through to strike Egypt, and he will see the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, and Yahweh will pass over the doorway and will not allow the destroyer to come to your houses to strike _you_.

###### v24
"And you will keep this event as a rule for you and for your children forever. ^[Or "until eternity"]

###### v25
_And_ ^[Literally "and it will be"] when you come into the land that Yahweh will give to you, as he said, you will keep this _religious custom_. ^[Literally "service" or "work"]

###### v26
_And_ ^[Literally "and it will be"] when your children say to you, 'What _is_ this _religious custom_ ^[Literally "service" or "work"] for you?' ^[Or "What does this service mean to you?"]

###### v27
you will say, 'It _is_ a Passover sacrifice for Yahweh, who passed over the houses of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] in Egypt when he struck Egypt; and he delivered our houses.'" And the people knelt down and they worshiped.

###### v28
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] went, and they did as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron; so they did.

###### v29
_And_ ^[Literally "and it was"] in the middle of the night, Yahweh struck all of the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who _was_ in the prison house and every firstborn of an animal.

###### v30
And Pharaoh got up _at_ night, he and all his servants and all Egypt, and a great cry of distress was in Egypt because there was not a house where there was no one dead.

###### v31
And he called Moses and Aaron _at_ night, and he said, "Get up, go out from the midst of my people, both you as well as the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said.

###### v32
Take both your sheep and goats as well as your cattle, and go, and bless also me."

###### v33
And _the_ Egyptians urged the people _in order_ to hurry their release ^[Or "to hasten to release them"] from the land, because they said, "All of us _will_ die!" ^[Or "We all are dead!"]

###### v34
And the people lifted up their dough before it had yeast; their kneading troughs _were_ wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulder.

###### v35
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did according to the word of Moses, and they asked from _the_ Egyptians _for_ objects of silver and objects of gold and _for_ clothing.

###### v36
And Yahweh gave the people favor in the eyes of _the_ Egyptians, and they granted _their_ requests, and they plundered _the_ Egyptians.

###### v37
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] set out from Rameses to Succoth; the men _were_ about six hundred thousand on foot, ^[Or "footmen," "infantrymen." The word probably has military connotations, as when it is used elsewhere in the numbering of soldiers (compare [[2 Sam-10#v6|2 Sam 10:6]]; [[1 Kgs-20#v29|1 Kgs 20:29]]; [[2 Kgs-13#v7|2 Kgs 13:7]])] besides dependents.

###### v38
And also a _mixed multitude_ ^[Literally "a large mixture" (compare [[Jer-25#v20|Jer 25:20]]; [[Ezek-30#v5|Ezek 30:5]])] went up with them and sheep and goats and cattle, very numerous livestock.

###### v39
And they baked the dough that they had brought out from Egypt _as_ cakes, unleavened bread, because it had no yeast when they were driven out from Egypt, and they were not able to delay, and also they had not made provisions for themselves.

###### v40
And the period of dwelling of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] that they dwelled in Egypt _was_ four hundred and thirty years.

###### v41
And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, on this exact day, all of Yahweh's divisions went out from the land of Egypt.

###### v42
It _is_ a night of vigils ^[Or "observances"] _belonging_ to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt; it _is_ this night _belonging_ to Yahweh _with_ vigils for all of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] throughout their generations.

###### v43
And Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "This _is_ the statute of the Passover: No foreigner may eat it.

###### v44
But any slave of a man, an acquisition by money, and you have circumcised him, then he may eat it.

###### v45
A temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat it.

###### v46
It will be eaten in one house; you will not bring part of the meat out from the house to the outside; and you will not break a bone of it.

###### v47
All of the community of Israel will prepare it.

###### v48
And when an alien dwells with you and he wants to prepare _the_ Passover for Yahweh, every male belonging to him must be circumcised, and then he may come near to prepare it, and he will be as the native of the land, but any uncircumcised _man_ may not eat it.

###### v49
One law will be for the native and for the alien who is dwelling in your midst."

###### v50
And all the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron; so they did.

###### v51
And it was on exactly this day Yahweh brought the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] out from the land of Egypt by their divisions.
