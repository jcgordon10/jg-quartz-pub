And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v2
"Consecrate to me every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] among humans ^[Hebrew "human"] and among domestic animals; ^[Hebrew "animal"] _it belongs to me_." ^[Literally "to/for me it"]

###### v3
And Moses said to the people, "Remember this day when you went out from Egypt, from a house of slaves, because with strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from here, and _food with_ yeast will not be eaten.

###### v4
Today you are going out in the month of Abib.

###### v5
And when Yahweh brings you to the land of the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] and the Hittites ^[Hebrew "Hittite"] and the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] and the Hivites ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] and the Jebusites ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"]--which he swore to your ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] to give to you, a land flowing with milk and honey--you will perform this service in this month.

###### v6
Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day _will be_ a feast for Yahweh.

###### v7
Unleavened bread will be eaten the seven days; _food with_ yeast will not be seen for you; and yeast will not be seen for you in all your territory.

###### v8
And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, 'This _is_ because of what Yahweh did for me when I came out from Egypt.'

###### v9
And it will be as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes so that the law of Yahweh will be in your mouth, that with a strong hand Yahweh brought you out from Egypt.

###### v10
And you will keep this statute at its appointed time _from year to year_. ^[Literally "from days to days"]

###### v11
"And when Yahweh brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] and he gives it to you,

###### v12
you will hand over every first offspring of a womb to Yahweh, and every first offspring dropped by a domestic animal that will belong to you, the males _will be_ for Yahweh.

###### v13
And every first offspring of a donkey you will redeem with small livestock, and if you will not redeem _it_, then you will break its neck, and every firstborn human among your sons you will redeem.

###### v14
And when your son asks you _in the future_, ^[Literally "tomorrow"] saying, 'What _is_ this?' you will say to him, 'With strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from a house of slaves.

###### v15
And when Pharaoh was stubborn to release us, Yahweh killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from firstborn human to firstborn domestic animal. Therefore I _am_ sacrificing to Yahweh every first offspring of a womb, the males, and every firstborn of my sons I redeem.'

###### v16
And it will be as a sign on your hand and as symbolic ornaments between your eyes that with strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt."

###### v17
And when Pharaoh released the people, God did not lead them the way of the land of the Philistines, though it _was_ nearer, because God said, "Lest the people change their mind when they see war and return to Egypt."

###### v18
So God led the people around _by_ the way of the desert _to_ the _Red Sea_, ^[Literally "sea of reed"] and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] went up in battle array from the land of Egypt.

###### v19
And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because _Joseph_ ^[Hebrew "he"] had made the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] solemnly swear an oath, saying, "God will surely attend to you, and you will take up my bones from here with you."
