###### v1
And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v2
"Speak to the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] so that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol _and the sea_; ^[Literally "and between the sea"] before Baal Zephon, _which is_ opposite it, you will camp by the sea.

###### v3
And Pharaoh will say of the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] 'They are wandering around in the land. The desert has closed in on them.'

###### v4
And I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and he will chase after them, and I will be glorified through Pharaoh and through all his army, and _the_ Egyptians will know that I _am_ Yahweh." And they did so.

###### v5
And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people fled, and the heart of Pharaoh was changed and _that of_ his servants toward the people, and they said, "What _is_ this we have done, that we have released Israel from serving us!"

###### v6
And he harnessed his chariot and took with him his people.

###### v7
And he took six hundred select chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and officers over all of them.

###### v8
And Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and he chased after the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] (Now the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] _were_ going out _boldly_. ^[Literally "with a raised/high hand"])

###### v9
And _the_ Egyptians chased after them, and they overtook them encamped at the sea--all the horses of the chariots of Pharaoh and his charioteers and his army--at Pi-hahiroth before Baal Zephon.

###### v10
And Pharaoh approached, and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] lifted their eyes, and there were the Egyptians traveling after them! And they were very afraid, and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] cried out to Yahweh.

###### v11
And they said to Moses, "Because there are no graves in Egypt? Is that why you have taken us to die in the desert? What _is_ this you have done to us by bringing us out from Egypt!

###### v12
Isn't this the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone _so that_ we can serve Egypt!' because serving Egypt is better for us than our dying in the desert."

###### v13
And Moses said to the people, "You must not be afraid. Stand _still_ and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will accomplish for you today, because _the_ Egyptians whom you see today you will see never again.

###### v14
Yahweh will fight for you, and you must be quiet."

###### v15
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Why do you cry out to me? Speak to the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] _so that_ they set out. ^[Or "journey," "move on," "travel"]

###### v16
And you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it _so that_ the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] can go in the middle of the sea on the dry land.

###### v17
And as for me, look, I _am_ about to harden the heart of _the_ Egyptians _so that_ they come after them, and I will display my glory through Pharaoh and through all of his army, through his chariots and through his charioteers.

###### v18
And _the_ Egyptians will know that I _am_ Yahweh when I display my glory through Pharaoh, through his chariots, and through his charioteers."

###### v19
And the angel of God who was going before the camp of Israel set out and went behind them. And the column of cloud set out ahead of them, and it stood _still_ behind them,

###### v20
_so that_ it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And _it was a dark cloud_, ^[Literally "the cloud was and the darkness"] but it gave light _to_ the night, ^[Or "it illumined the night"] _so that_ _neither approached the other_ ^[Literally "this did not come near to this"] all night.

###### v21
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh moved the sea ^[Or "caused the sea to go," "drove the sea"] with a strong east wind all night, and he made the sea _become_ dry ground, and the waters were divided.

###### v22
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] entered the middle of the sea on the dry land. The waters _were_ a wall for them on their right and on their left.

###### v23
And _the_ Egyptians gave chase ^[Or "pursued," "chased"] and entered after them--all the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his charioteers--into the middle of the sea.

###### v24
And during the morning watch, Yahweh looked down to the Egyptian camp _from_ in the column of fire and cloud, and he threw the Egyptian camp into a panic.

###### v25
And he removed ^[Or "let turn aside"] the wheels of their chariots _so that_ they drove them with difficulty, and _the_ Egyptians said, "We must flee away ^[Or "let us flee," "let me run away"; the verb is singular, but it is plural in context] from Israel because Yahweh _is_ fighting for them against Egypt."

###### v26
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, and let the waters return over _the_ Egyptians, over their chariots, and over their charioteers."

###### v27
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned _at daybreak_ ^[Literally "at the turning of morning"] to its normal level, and _the_ Egyptians _were_ fleeing _because of it_, ^[Literally "to/for/from the meeting of it"] and Yahweh swept _the_ Egyptians into the middle of the sea.

###### v28
And the waters returned and covered the chariots and the charioteers--all the army of Pharaoh coming after them into the sea. Not _even_ ^[Literally "up to," "as far as"] one survived among them.

###### v29
But the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] walked on the dry land in the middle of the sea. The waters _were_ a wall for them on their right and on their left.

###### v30
