###### v1
And they set out from Elim, and all the community of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] came to the desert of Sin, which _is_ between Elim _and Sinai_, ^[Literally "and between Sinai"] in the fifteenth day of the second month of their going out from the land of Egypt.

###### v2
And all the community of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] grumbled against Moses and against Aaron in the desert.

###### v3
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] said to them, "_If only we had died_ ^[Literally "who will give our dying"] by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots ^[Hebrew "pot"] of meat, when we ate bread _until we were full_, ^[Literally "to contentment" or "to satisfaction"] because you have brought us out to this desert to kill all of this assembly with hunger."

###### v4
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Look, I am going to rain down for you bread from the heavens, and the people will go out and gather enough for the day on its day; in that way I will test them: Will they go according to my law or not?

###### v5
And then on the sixth day, they will prepare what they bring, and it will be twice over what they will gather every _other_ day."

###### v6
And Moses and Aaron said to all the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] "_In the_ evening, you will know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt,

###### v7
and _in the_ morning, you will see the glory of Yahweh, _for he hears_ ^[Literally "at/in his hearing"] your grumblings against Yahweh, and what _are_ we that you grumble against us?"

###### v8
And Moses said, "When in the evening Yahweh gives you meat to eat and bread in the morning _to fill up on_, ^[Literally "to be satisfied"] _for he hears_ ^[Literally "at/in his hearing"] your grumblings that you grumble against him--and what _are_ we? Your grumblings _are_ not against us but against Yahweh."

###### v9
And Moses said to Aaron, "Say to all the community of the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] 'Come near before Yahweh because he has heard your grumblings.'"

###### v10
And at the moment of Aaron's speaking to all the community of the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] they turned to the desert, _and just then_ ^[Literally "look" or "behold"] the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud.

###### v11
And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v12
"I have heard the grumblings of the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] Speak to them, saying, '_At twilight_ ^[Literally "between the evenings"] you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be full _with_ bread, and you will know that I _am_ Yahweh your God.'"

###### v13
And so it was, in the evening, the quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning, a layer of dew was all around the camp.

###### v14
And the layer of dew came up, _and there_ ^[Literally "look" or "behold"] on the face of the desert was a fine granular substance, fine like frost on the ground.

###### v15
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] saw, and they said _to each other_, ^[Literally "a man to his brother"] "What _is_ this?" because they did not know what it _was_. And Moses said to them, "That _is_ the bread that Yahweh has given to you as food.

###### v16
This _is_ the word that Yahweh commanded, 'Gather from it, _each according to what he can eat_, ^[Literally "a man for the mouth of his eating"] an omer per person ^[Literally "skull" or "head"] _according to_ the number of you. ^[Or "the number of your selves"] You each shall take _enough_ for whoever _is_ in his tent.'"

###### v17
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did so, and they gathered, some more and some less.

###### v18
And _when_ they measured with the omer, the one gathering more had no surplus, and the one gathering less had no lack; they gathered _each according to what he could eat_. ^[Literally "a man for the mouth of his eating"]

###### v19
And Moses said to them, "Let no one leave any of it until morning."

###### v20
But they did not listen to Moses. Some people ^[Literally "men"] left _some_ of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them.

###### v21
And they gathered it morning by morning, _each according to what he could eat_, ^[Literally "a man according to the mouth of his eating"] and it melted _when_ the sun was hot. ^[Literally "and the sun was hot, and he/it melted"]

###### v22
And when it was the sixth day, they gathered twice _as much_ bread, two omers for one _person_, and all the leaders of the community came and told Moses.

###### v23
And he said to them, "This is what Yahweh has said. Tomorrow _is_ a rest period, a holy Sabbath for Yahweh. Bake what you _want to_ bake, and boil what you _want to_ boil. Put aside all the surplus for yourselves for safekeeping until the morning."

###### v24
And they put it aside until the morning, as Moses had commanded, and it did not make a stench, and not a maggot was in it.

###### v25
And Moses said, "Eat it today, because today is a Sabbath for Yahweh. Today you will not find it in the field.

###### v26
Six days you will gather it, but on the seventh day, _the_ Sabbath, it will not be _present_ on it."

###### v27
And on the seventh day _some_ of the people went out to gather, and they did not find _any_.

###### v28
And Yahweh said to Moses, "How long do you ^[Plural] refuse to keep my commands and my laws?

###### v29
See, because Yahweh has given to you the Sabbath, therefore he is giving to you on the sixth day bread for two days. Stay, _each in his location_; ^[Literally "a man under him/it"] let no one go from his place on the seventh day."

###### v30
And the people rested on the seventh day.

###### v31
And the house of Israel called its name "manna." And it _was_ like coriander seed, white, and its taste _was_ like a wafer with honey.

###### v32
And Moses said, "This is the word that Yahweh has commanded. 'A full omer of it _is_ for safekeeping for your generations so that they will see the bread that I fed you in the desert when I brought you from the land of Egypt.'"

###### v33
And Moses said to Aaron, "Take one jar and put there a full omer of manna. Leave it before Yahweh for safekeeping for your generations."

###### v34
As Yahweh had commanded Moses, so Aaron left it before the testimony for safekeeping.

###### v35
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] ate the manna forty years, until their coming to an inhabited land; they ate the manna until their coming to the border of the land of Canaan.

###### v36
(And an omer _is_ a tenth of an ephah.)
