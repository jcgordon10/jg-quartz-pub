###### v1
And all the community of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] set out from the desert of Sin for their journeys according to the command of Yahweh, and they camped in Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.

###### v2
And the people quarreled with Moses, and they said, "Give us water so that we can drink." And Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?"

###### v3
And the people thirsted for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, "Why _ever_ ^[Or "at all"; literally "this"] did you bring us up from Egypt to kill me ^[The unexpected switch to first-person singular pronouns reflects the fact that the question summarizes a host of angry accusations and self-centered concern] and my sons and my cattle with thirst?"

###### v4
And Moses cried out to Yahweh, saying, "What will I do with this people? A little longer and they will stone me."

###### v5
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Go on before the people and take with you _some_ from the elders of Israel, and the staff with which you struck the Nile take in your hand, and go.

###### v6
Look, I _will be_ standing before you there on the rock in Horeb, and you will strike the rock, and water will come out from it, and the people will drink."
And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel.

###### v7
And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarrel of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and because of their testing Yahweh _by_ saying, "Is Yahweh in our midst or not?"

###### v8
And Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.

###### v9
And Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us, and go out, fight against Amalek tomorrow. I _will be_ standing on the top of the hill, and the staff of God _will be_ in my hand."

###### v10
And Joshua did as Moses had said to him to fight with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up _to_ the top of the hill.

###### v11
And ^[Literally "and it would be"] when Moses raised his hand, Israel would prevail, but when he rested his hand, Amalek would prevail.

###### v12
But the hands of Moses _were_ heavy, and they took a stone and placed it under him, and he sat on it; Aaron and Hur supported his hands, _one on each side_, ^[Or "one on one side and one on the other"; literally "one from this and one from this"] and his hands _were_ steady until _sundown_. ^[Literally "the coming in of the sun"]

###### v13
And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with _the_ _edge of the sword_. ^[Literally "mouth of _the_ sword"]

###### v14
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Write this _as_ a memorial in the scroll and _recite it in the hearing of_ ^[Literally "and put in the ears of"] Joshua, because I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens."

###### v15
And Moses built an altar, and he called its name Yahweh _Is_ My Banner.

###### v16
And he said, "Because a hand _was_ against the throne of Yah, ^[Or "indeed a hand on the throne of Yah"; the phrase is unclear] a war _will be_ for Yahweh with Amalek from generation _to_ generation."
