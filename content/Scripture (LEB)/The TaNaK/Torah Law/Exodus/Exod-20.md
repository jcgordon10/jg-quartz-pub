###### v1
And God spoke all these words, saying,

###### v2
"I _am_ Yahweh, your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves.

###### v3
"There shall be for you no other gods before me.

###### v4
"You shall not make for yourself a divine image _with_ any form that _is_ in the heavens above or that _is_ in the earth below or that _is_ in the water below the earth.

###### v5
You will not bow down to them, and you will not serve them, because I _am_ Yahweh your God, a jealous God, punishing _the_ guilt of _the_ parents on the children on _the_ third and on _the_ fourth _generations_ ^["Generations" is understood from comparison with parallel verses (compare [[Exod-34#v6|Exod 34:6–7]][[Exod-34#v7|]]; [[Deut-07#v9|Deut 7:9]])] of those hating me,

###### v6
and showing loyal love to thousands _of generations_ ^["Generations" is understood from comparison with parallel verses ( compare [[Exod-34#v6|Exod 34:6–7]][[Exod-34#v7|]]; [[Deut-07#v9|Deut 7:9]])] of those loving me and of those keeping my commandments.

###### v7
"You shall not _misuse the name of Yahweh your God_, ^[Literally "take up/bear/carry the name of Yahweh your God for _what is_ worthless/false/empty"] because Yahweh will not leave unpunished _anyone_ who _misuses his name_. ^[Literally "bears his name for _what is_ false"]

###### v8
"Remember the day of the Sabbath, to consecrate it.

###### v9
Six days you will work, and you will do all your work.

###### v10
But the seventh day _is_ a Sabbath for Yahweh your God; you will not do any work--you or your son or your daughter, your male slave or your female slave, or your animal, or your alien who _is_ in your gates--

###### v11
because _in_ six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that _is_ in them, and on the seventh day he rested. Therefore Yahweh blessed the seventh day and consecrated it.

###### v12
"Honor your father and your mother, so that your days can be long on the land that Yahweh your God _is_ giving you.

###### v15

###### v16
"You shall not testify against your neighbor _with_ a false witness.

###### v17
"You shall not covet the house of your neighbor; you will not covet the wife of your neighbor or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that _is_ your neighbor's."

###### v18
And all the people _were_ seeing the thunder and the lightning and the sound of the ram's horn and the mountain smoking, and the people saw, and they trembled, and they stood at a distance.

###### v19
And they said to Moses, "You speak with us, and we will listen, but let not God speak with us, lest we die."

###### v20
And Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid. God has come to test you so that his fear will be before you so that you do not sin."

###### v21

###### v22
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Thus you will say to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] 'You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from the heavens.

###### v23
You will not make alongside me gods of silver, and gods of gold you will not make for yourselves.

###### v24
An altar of earth you will make for me, and you will sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I cause my name to be remembered, ^[Or "proclaimed"] I will come to you, and I will bless you.

###### v25
And if you make an altar of stones for me, you will not build them _as_ hewn stone, because if you use your chisel on it, you have defiled it.

###### v26
You will not go up with steps onto my altar, that your nakedness not be exposed on it.'
