###### v2
'If you buy a Hebrew slave, he will serve six years, and in the seventh he will go out as free for nothing. ^[Or "for no payment"]

###### v3
If he comes in single, he will go out single. If he is the husband of a wife, his wife will go out with him.

###### v4
If his master gives him a wife and she bears for him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will belong to her master, and _the slave_ will go out single.

###### v5
But if the slave explicitly says, "I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,"

###### v6
his master will present him to God ^[Or "present him to the judges"] and bring him to the door or to the doorpost, and his master will pierce his ear with an awl, and he will serve him forever.

###### v7
"'And if a man sells his daughter as a slave woman, she will not go out as male slaves go out.

###### v8
If _she does not please her master_ ^[Literally "bad in the eyes of her master"] who selected her, he will allow her to be redeemed; he has no authority to sell her to foreign people, since he has dealt treacherously with her.

###### v9
And if he selects her for his son, he shall do for her according to the regulations for daughters.

###### v10
If he takes for himself another, he will not reduce her food, her clothing, or her right of cohabitation.

###### v12
"'_Whoever strikes someone_ ^[Literally "A striker of a man"] and he dies will surely be put to death.

And _whoever strikes_ ^[Literally "a striker of"] his father or his mother will surely be put to death.

###### v19
if he stands and walks about in the outside on his staff, the striker will be unpunished; he will only pay for his inactivity ^[Literally "his sitting"] _toward his full recovery_." ^[Literally "and he indeed will recover"]

###### v20
And if a man strikes his male slave or his female slave with the rod and he dies under his hand, he will surely be avenged.

"'And if men fight and they injure a pregnant woman, and her children go out and there is not serious injury, he will surely be fined as the woman's husband demands concerning him _and as the judges determine_. ^[Literally "and he will give according to judgments" or "judges" or "arbitrators"]

###### v27
And if he causes the tooth of his male slave or the tooth of his female slave to fall out, he will release him as free in place of his tooth.

###### v29
But if it was a goring ox _before_ ^[Literally "yesterday three days ago"] and its owner was warned and did not restrain it and it kills a man or a woman, the ox will be stoned, and the owner also will be put to death.
