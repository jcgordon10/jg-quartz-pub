###### v1
And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v2
"See, I have called by name ^[In other words, "specifically chosen"] Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah.

###### v3
And I have filled him _with_ the Spirit of God, with wisdom and with skill ^[Or "understanding," "discernment," "cleverness"] and with knowledge and with every _kind of_ craftsmanship,

###### v4
to devise designs, to work with gold and with silver and with bronze,

###### v5
and in stonecutting for setting and in cutting wood, for doing every _kind of_ craftsmanship.

###### v6
And, look, I have given with him Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, and I have put skill in the heart of all _the_ skilled of heart, and they will make all that I have commanded you--

###### v7
the tent of assembly and the ark of the testimony and the atonement cover that _is_ on it and all the equipment of the tent,

###### v8
and the table and all its equipment, and the pure _gold_ lampstand and all its equipment, and the incense altar,

###### v9
and the altar of burnt offering and all its equipment, and the basin and its stand,

###### v10
and the garments of woven material, and _the garments of the sanctuary_ ^[Literally "the garments of the holiness" or "the holy garments"] for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to serve as priests,

###### v11
and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense for the sanctuary. According to all that I have commanded you, they will make _it_.

###### v12
And Yahweh spoke to Moses _and_ said,

###### v13
"And you, speak to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] saying, 'Surely you must keep my Sabbaths, because it _is_ a sign between me and you throughout your generations, _in order_ to know that I _am_ Yahweh, who consecrates you.

###### v14
And you must keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you; defilers ^[Or "profaners," those who treat it as common] of it will surely be put to death, because anyone who does work on it--that person will be cut off from among his people.

###### v15
_On_ six days work can be done, and on the seventh _is a Sabbath of complete rest_, ^[Literally "a Sabbath of 'Sabbathation.'" "Sabbathation" is not a real word, but devised as an attempt to convey the sounds of the related nouns in the Hebrew phrase] _a holy day_ ^[Literally "holiness"] for Yahweh; anyone doing work on the Sabbath day will surely be put to death.

###### v16
The _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] will pay attention to the Sabbath _in order_ to fulfill the Sabbath ^[Or "keep the Sabbath to do/observe the Sabbath"] throughout their generations _as_ a lasting covenant.

###### v17
It _is_ a sign between me and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] forever, because _in_ six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh he ceased ^[Or "rested"] and recovered." ^[Or "breathed freely," "got his breath"]

###### v18
And when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave to Moses the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets, written with the finger of God.
