###### v1
And the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, and the people gathered opposite Aaron, and they said to him, "Come, ^[Or "arise" or "get up"] make for us gods who will go before us, because this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him."

Why should _the_ Egyptians _say_ ^[Literally "say, saying"], 'With evil _intent_ he brought them out to kill them in the mountains and wipe them from the face of the earth'? ^[Or "ground"] Turn from _your fierce anger_ ^[Literally "the heat of your nose"] and relent concerning the disaster for your people.
