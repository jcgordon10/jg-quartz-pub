###### v1
And Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Go, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land that I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your offspring.'

###### v2
And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] and the Hittites ^[Hebrew "Hittite"] and the Perizzites, ^[Hebrew "Perizzite"] the Hivites, ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] and the Jebusites, ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"]

###### v3
_Go_ to a land flowing with milk and honey, but I will not go up among you, because you _are_ a stiff-necked people, lest I destroy you on the way."

###### v4
And the people heard this troubling ^[Or "bad," "disastrous," "calamitous"] word, and they mourned, and they each did not put their ornaments on themselves.

###### v5
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Say to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] 'You _are_ a stiff-necked people; _if_ one moment I were to go up among you, I would destroy you. And now take down your ornaments from on you, and I will _decide_ ^[Literally "know"] what I will do to you."

###### v6
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb _onward_.

###### v7
And Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp far from the camp, and he called it the tent of assembly, _and_ ^[Literally "and it would be"] all seeking Yahweh would go out to the tent of assembly, which _was_ outside the camp.

###### v8
_And_ ^[Literally "and it would be"] at the going out of Moses to the tent, all the people would rise and stand, each at the opening of his tent, and gaze after Moses until his entering the tent.

###### v9
_And_ ^[Literally "and it would be"] at the entering of Moses _into_ the tent the column of cloud would descend and stand _at_ the opening of the tent, and he would speak with Moses.

###### v10
And all the people would see the column of cloud standing _at_ the opening of the tent, and all the people would rise and bow in worship, each _at_ the opening of his tent.

###### v11
And Yahweh would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his neighbor. And he would return to the camp, and his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not leave the middle of the tent.

###### v12
And Moses said to Yahweh, "See, you _are_ saying to me, 'Take this people up.' But you have not let me know whom you will send with me, and you yourself have said, 'I know you by name, and you also have found favor in my eyes.'

###### v13
And now if I have found favor in your eyes, make known _to_ me, please, your way, and so I may know you so that I can find favor in your eyes. And see that this nation is your people."

###### v14
And he said, "My presence will go, and I will give you rest."

###### v15
And he said to him, "If your presence _is_ not going, do not bring us up from here.

###### v16
And by what will it be known then that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people? Is it not by your going with us? And _so_ we will be distinguished, I and your people, from all the people who _are_ on the face of the ground."

###### v17
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Also I will do this thing that you have spoken, because you have found favor in my eyes and I have known you by name."

###### v18
And he said, "Please show me your glory."

###### v19
And he said, "I myself will cause all my goodness to pass over before you, and I will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you, and I will be gracious _to_ whom I will be gracious, and I will show compassion _to_ whom I will show compassion."

###### v20
But he said, "You are not able to see my face, because _a_ human will not see me and live."

###### v21
And Yahweh said, "There is a place with me, and you will stand on the rock.

###### v22
_And_ ^[Literally "and it will be"] when my glory passes over, I will put you in the rock's crevice, and I will cover you _with_ my hand until I pass over.

###### v23
And I will remove my hand, and you will see my back, but my face will not be visible."
