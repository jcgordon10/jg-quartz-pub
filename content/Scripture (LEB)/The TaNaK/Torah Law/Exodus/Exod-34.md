###### v2
And be ready for the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount Sinai and present yourself to me there on the top of the mountain.

###### v3
And no one will go up with you, and neither let anyone be seen on all the mountain, nor let the sheep and goats and the cattle graze _opposite_ ^[Literally "to the front of"] that mountain."

###### v6
And Yahweh passed over before him, and he proclaimed, "Yahweh, Yahweh, God, _who is_ compassionate and gracious, _slow to anger_, ^[Literally "long of nose"] and abounding with ^[Or "rich in" or "great of"] loyal love and faithfulness,

###### v7
keeping loyal love to the thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and he does not leave utterly unpunished, punishing _the_ guilt of fathers on sons and on sons of sons on third and fourth _generations_."

###### v8
And Moses hurried and knelt down to the earth and worshiped.

###### v9
And he said, "Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, Lord, let my Lord, please, go among us--indeed it is a stiff-necked people--and forgive our iniquity and our sin and _take us as your possession_." ^[Or "take possession of us," "make us your inheritance"]

###### v10
And he said, "Look, I _am about to_ make a covenant. In front of all your people I will do wonders that have not been created on all the earth and among all the nations, and all the people among whom you _are_ will see Yahweh's work, because what I _am about to_ do with you _will be_ awesome.

###### v11
"Keep for yourself what I myself have commanded you today. Look, I _am about to_ drive from before you the Amorites and the Canaanites ^[Hebrew "Canaanite"] and the Hittites ^[Hebrew "Hittite"] and the Perizzites ^[Hebrew "Perizzite"] and the Hivites ^[Hebrew "Hivite"] and the Jebusites. ^[Hebrew "Jebusite"]

###### v12
Be careful for yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, lest it be a snare among you.

###### v13
Rather, you will tear down their altars, and you will break their stone pillars, and you will cut off their Asherah poles.

###### v14
For you will not bow in worship to another god, for 'Yahweh _Is_ Jealous' is his name, he _is_ a jealous God,

###### v15
lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they prostitute _themselves_ after their gods, and they sacrifice to their gods, and they invite you, and you eat their sacrifice,

###### v16
and you take from their daughters for your sons, and their daughters prostitute _themselves_ after their gods, and they cause your sons to prostitute _themselves_ after their gods.

You will not make gods of cast metal for yourself.

###### v18
"You will keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, which I commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.

###### v19
Every first offspring of a womb _is_ for me--all of your male livestock, _the_ first offspring of cattle and small livestock.

###### v20
But the first offspring of a donkey you will redeem with small livestock, and if you will not redeem _it_, you will break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you will redeem, and you will not appear before me empty-handed.

###### v21
Six days you will work, and on the seventh day you will rest; in the _time of_ plowing and in the _time of_ harvest you will rest.

And _you yourself_ ^[Literally "for yourself" or "as for you, you will observe"] will observe the Feast of Weeks--the firstfruits of the wheat harvest--and the Feast of Harvest Gathering at the turn of the year.

###### v23
Three times in the year all your males will appear before the Lord, Yahweh, the God of Israel,

because I will evict nations before you, and I will enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh your God three times in the year.

###### v25
"You will not slaughter the blood of my sacrifice on _food with_ yeast, and the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover will not stay overnight to the morning.

###### v26

###### v28
And he was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights. He ate no food and drank no water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten words.

###### v29

###### v30

And Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the community returned to him, and Moses spoke to them.

And afterward all the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] came near, and he commanded them all that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.

###### v33
And Moses finished speaking with them, and he put a veil on his face.

###### v34

###### v35
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] would see the face of Moses, that the skin of the face of Moses shone, and Moses would put back the veil on his face until his coming to speak with him.
