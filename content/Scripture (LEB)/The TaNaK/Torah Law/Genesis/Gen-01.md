[[Gen-02|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth--

###### v2
Now ^[Or "And"] the earth was formless and empty, and darkness _was_ over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God _was_ hovering over the surface of the waters.

###### v3
And God said, "Let there be light!" And there was light.

###### v4
And God saw the light, that _it was_ good, and God caused _there to be_ a separation between the light and between the darkness.

###### v5
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, _the_ first day.

###### v6
And God said, "Let there be a vaulted dome ^[Or "expanse"] in the midst of the waters, and _let it cause a separation between the waters_." ^[Literally "Let there be a separation made between waters to waters"]

###### v7
So ^[Or "And"] God made the vaulted dome, ^[Or "expanse"] and he caused a separation between the waters which _were_ under the vaulted dome ^[Or "expanse"] and between the waters which were over the vaulted dome. ^[Or "expanse"] And it was so.

###### v8
And God called the vaulted dome ^[Or "expanse"] "heaven." ^[Or "sky"] And there was evening, and there was morning, a second day.

###### v9
And God said, "Let the waters under heaven ^[Or "the sky"] be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear." And it was so.

###### v10
And God called the dry ground "earth," and he called the collection of the waters "seas." And God saw that _it was_ good.

###### v11
And God said, "Let the earth produce green plants _that will_ bear seed--fruit trees bearing fruit _in which there is seed_ ^[Literally "which its seed _is_ in it"]--according to its ^[Or "their"] kind, on the earth." And it was so.

###### v12
And the earth brought forth green plants bearing seed according to its ^[Or "their"] kind, and trees bearing fruit _in which there was seed_ ^[Literally "which its seed _is_ in it"] according to its ^[Or "their"] kind. And God saw that _it was_ good.

###### v13
And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.

###### v14
And God said, "Let there be lights ^[Or "light sources"] in the vaulted dome ^[Or "expanse"] of heaven ^[Or "the sky"] _to separate day from night_, ^[Literally "to make a separation between the day and between the night"] and let them be as signs and for appointed times, and for days and years,

###### v15
and they shall be as lights ^[Or "light sources"] in the vaulted dome ^[Or "expanse"] of heaven ^[Or "the sky"] to give light on the earth." And it _was_ so.

###### v16
And God made two lights, ^[Or "light sources"] the greater light ^[Or "light source"] to rule ^[Literally "as the authority of"] the day and the smaller light ^[Or "light source"] to rule ^[Literally "as the authority of"] the night, and the stars.

###### v17
And God placed them in the vaulted dome ^[Or "expanse"] of heaven ^[Or "the sky"] to give light on the earth

###### v18
and to rule over the day and over the night, and to _separate light from darkness_. ^[Literally "make a separation between the light and between the darkness"] And God saw that _it was_ good.

###### v19
And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.

###### v20
And God said, "Let the waters swarm _with_ swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly over the earth across the face of the vaulted dome ^[Or "expanse"] of heaven. ^[Or "the sky"]

###### v21
So ^[Or "And"] God created the great sea creatures and every living creature _that_ moves, _with_ which the waters swarm, according to their kind, and every bird _with_ wings according to its ^[Or "their"] kind. And God saw that _it was_ good.

###### v22
And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth."

###### v23
And there was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day.

###### v24
And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind: cattle and moving things, and wild animals ^[Literally "animals of the earth/land"] according to their kind." And it was so.

###### v25
So ^[Or "And"] God made wild animals ^[Literally "animals of the earth/land"] according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind, and every creeping thing of the earth according to its ^[Or "their"] kind. And God saw that _it was_ good.

###### v26
And God said, "Let us make humankind in ^[Or "as"] our image and according to ^[Or "as"] our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of heaven, ^[Or "the sky"] and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every moving thing that moves upon the earth."

###### v27
So ^[Or "And"] God created humankind in ^[Or "as"] his image, in ^[Or "as"] the likeness of God he created him, ^[Or "it" _collective: humankind_] male and female he created them.

###### v28
And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of heaven, ^[Or "the sky"] and over every animal that moves upon the earth."

###### v29
And God said, "Look--I am giving to you every plant _that_ bears seed which _is_ on the face of the whole earth, and every kind of tree _that bears fruit_. ^[Literally "which in it fruit of a tree bears seed"] They shall be yours as food."

###### v30
And to every kind of animal of the earth and to every bird of heaven, ^[Or "the sky"] and to everything that moves upon the earth in which _there is_ life _I am giving_ every green plant as food." And it was so.

###### v31
And God saw everything that he had made and, behold, _it was_ very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, a sixth day.
