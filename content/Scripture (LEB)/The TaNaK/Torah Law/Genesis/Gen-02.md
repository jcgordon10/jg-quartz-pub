And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.

###### v5
_before any plant of the field was_ ^[Literally "and every plant of the field not yet was"] on earth, and _before_ _any plant of the field_ ^[Literally "and every plant of the field not yet"] had sprung up, because Yahweh God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no human being to cultivate the ground,

###### v6
but a stream _would_ rise from the earth and water the whole face of the ground--

###### v7
when ^[Or "and"] Yahweh God formed the man ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] _of_ dust from the ground, and he blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.

###### v10
Now ^[Or "And"] a river flowed out from Eden that watered the garden, and from there it diverged and became four branches.

###### v11
The name of the first _is_ the Pishon. It went around all the land of Havilah, where _there is_ gold.

###### v12

###### v13
And the name of the second _is_ Gihon. It went around all the land of Cush.

And Yahweh God commanded the man, ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] saying, "From every tree of the garden _you may freely eat_, ^[Literally "eating you may eat"]

###### v17
but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day _that you eat_ ^[Literally "of your eating"] from it _you shall surely die_." ^[Literally "dying you shall die"]

###### v18
Then ^[Or "And"] Yahweh God said, "_it is_ not good _that_ the man ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] is alone. I will make for him a helper _as his counterpart_." ^[Literally "as his opposite"]

###### v19
And out of the ground Yahweh God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, ^[Or "the heavens"] and he brought _each_ to the man ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] to see what he would call it. And whatever the man ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] called that living creature _was_ its name.

###### v20
And the man ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] _gave names_ ^[Literally "called names"] to every domesticated animal and to the birds of heaven ^[Or "the sky"] and to all the wild animals. ^[Literally "animals of the earth/land"] But for _the_ man there was not found a helper _as his counterpart_. ^[Literally "as his opposite"]

###### v21
And Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man. ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] While ^[Or "And"] he slept, he took one of his ribs, and closed up _the flesh where it had been_. ^[Literally "the flesh in the place of it"]

###### v22
And Yahweh God fashioned the rib which he had taken from the man ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] into a woman and brought her to the man. ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article]

###### v23
And the man ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] said,
"_She is now_ ^[Literally "this _one_ the time"] bone from my bones
and flesh from my flesh;
_she_ ^[Literally "this _one_"] shall be called 'Woman,'
for _she was taken_ ^[Literally "this _one_ was taken"] from man."
