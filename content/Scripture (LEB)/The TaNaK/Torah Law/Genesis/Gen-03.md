The woman said to the serpent, "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,

For God knows that on the day you _both_ eat from it, then your eyes will be opened and you _both_ shall be like gods, ^[The plural is in the context of v. [[Gen-03#v22|22]] _"one of us"_ and the plural suffix pronouns \[\["you _all_"\]\] throughout the verse] knowing good and evil."

###### v6
When ^[Or "And"] the woman saw that the tree _was_ good for food and that it _was_ a delight to the eyes, and the tree was desirable to make _one_ wise, then ^[Or "and"] she took from its fruit and she ate. And she gave _it_ also to her husband with her, and he ate.

Then ^[Or "And"] they heard the sound of Yahweh God walking in the garden _at the windy time of day_. ^[Literally "at the wind of the day"] And the man ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.

###### v9
And Yahweh God called to the man ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] and said to him, "Where _are_ you?"

###### v10
And he replied, ^[Literally "And he said"; "replied" distinguishes Adam as the speaker] "I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid because I _am_ naked, so I hid myself."

Then he ^[That is, Yahweh God] asked, ^[Or "said"] "Who told you that you _were_ naked? Have you eaten from _the tree from which I forbade you to eat_?" ^[Literally "the tree which I commanded to not eat from it"]

###### v12
And the man ^["The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article] replied, ^[Or "said"] "The woman whom you gave _to be_ with me--she gave to me from the tree and I ate."

Then ^[Or "And"] Yahweh God said to the woman, "What _is_ this you have done?" And the woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."

###### v14
Then ^[Or "And"] Yahweh God said to the serpent,
"Because you have done this,
you _will be_ cursed
more than any domesticated animal
and more than any wild animal. ^[Literally "animal of the earth/land"]
On your belly you shall go
and dust you shall eat
all the days of your life.

###### v15
And I will put hostility
between you and between the woman,
and between your offspring ^[Literally "seed"] and between her offspring; ^[Literally "seed"]
he will strike you _on the_ head,
and you will strike him _on the_ heel."

###### v16
To the woman he said,
"I will greatly increase
_your pain in childbearing_; ^[Literally "your pain and your childbearing"]
in pain you shall bear children.
And to your husband _shall be_ your desire.
And he shall rule over you."

###### v17
And to Adam ^[The noun lacks the definite article and is taken as a proper noun in this context] he said, "Because you listened to the voice of your wife and you ate from the tree _from which I forbade you to eat_, ^[Literally "from the tree which I commanded saying not to eat from it"]
the ground _shall be_ cursed on your account.
In pain you shall eat _from_ it
all the days of your life.

###### v18
And thorns and thistles shall sprout for you,
and you shall eat the plants of the field.

###### v19
By the sweat of your brow ^[Literally "your face"]
you shall eat bread,
until your return to the ground.
For from it you were taken;
for you are dust,
and to dust you shall return."
