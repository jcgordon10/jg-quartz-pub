###### v1
Now Adam knew ^[Or "had intercourse with"] Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain. And she said, "I have given birth to a man with _the help of_ Yahweh."

###### v2
_Then she bore_ ^[Literally "And she added to bear"] his brother Abel. And Abel became a keeper of sheep, and Cain became a tiller of the ground.

###### v3
And _in the course of time_ ^[Literally "it came to pass at the end of days"] Cain brought an offering from the fruit of the ground to Yahweh,

###### v4
and Abel also brought _an offering_ from _the choicest firstlings of his flock_. ^[Literally "from the firstlings of his flock and from their fat"] And Yahweh looked with favor to Abel and to his offering,

###### v5
but to Cain and to his offering he did not look with favor. And Cain became very angry, and his face fell.

###### v6
And Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why is your face fallen?

###### v7
If you do well _will I not accept you_? ^[Literally "a lifting up"; this is an abbreviation of the Hebrew idiom "to lift up the face," which means "to accept or regard with favor"] But if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. And its desire _is_ for you, but you must rule over it."

###### v8
Then ^[Or "And"] Cain said to his brother Abel, _"Let us go out into the field."_ ^[This phrase is not present in the Hebrew; it is supplied in other versions _Samaritan, Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate_] And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.

###### v9
Then ^[Or "And"] Yahweh said to Cain, "Where _is_ Abel your brother?" And he said, "I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"

###### v10
And he said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground.

###### v11
So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive the blood of your brother from your hand.

###### v12
When you till the ground _it shall no longer yield its strength to you_. ^[Literally "it shall not add to give its strength to you"] You shall be a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth."

###### v13
And Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment _is_ greater than _I can_ bear.

###### v14
Look, you have driven me out today from the face of the ground, and from your face I must hide. I will be a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth, and it will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."

###### v15
Then ^[Or "And"] Yahweh said to him, "Therefore, whoever kills Cain will be avenged sevenfold." Then ^[Or "And"] Yahweh put a sign on Cain so that whoever found him would not kill him.

###### v16
And Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh, and he settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

###### v17
And Cain knew ^[Or "had intercourse with"] his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. And when he built a city _he named the city after his son, Enoch_. ^[Literally "he called the name of the city as the name of his son, Enoch"]

###### v18
And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.

###### v19
And Lamech took to himself two wives. ^[Or "women"] The name of the first _was_ Adah, and the name of the second _was_ Zillah.

###### v20
And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and _those who have_ livestock.

###### v21
And the name of his brother _was_ Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and wind instruments.

###### v22
Then ^[Or "And"] Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-Cain who forged all _kinds of_ tools of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain _was_ Naamah.

###### v23
Then ^[Or "And"] Lamech said to his wives,
"Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice;
O wives of Lamech, hear my words.
I have killed a man for wounding me,
Even a young man for injuring me.

###### v24
If Cain is avenged sevenfold,
Then Lamech _will be avenged_ seventy and seven _times_.

###### v25
Then ^[Or "And"] Adam knew ^[Or "had intercourse with"] his wife again, and she gave birth to a son. And she called his name Seth, for _she said_ "God has appointed to me another child in the place of Abel, because Cain killed him."

###### v26
And as for Seth, he also fathered a son, and he called his name Enosh. At that time he ^[Or "humankind," if the 3ms form is considered collective] began to call on the name of Yahweh.
