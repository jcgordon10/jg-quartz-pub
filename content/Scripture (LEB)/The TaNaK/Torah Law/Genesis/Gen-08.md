###### v1
And God remembered Noah and all the wild animals, and all the domesticated animals that _were_ with him in the ark. And God caused a wind to blow ^[Or "go"] over the earth, and the waters subsided.

###### v2
And the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens ^[Or "the sky"] were closed, and the rain from the heavens ^[Or "the sky"] was restrained.

###### v3
And the waters receded from the earth _gradually_, ^[Literally "going and returning"] and the waters abated at the end of one hundred and fifty days.

###### v4
And the ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.

###### v5
And the waters _continued to recede_ ^[Literally "going and receding"] to the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.

###### v6
And it happened _that_ at the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made.

###### v7
And he sent out a ^[Or "the"] raven; ^[Or "crow"] _it went to and fro_ ^[Literally "it went out, going out and returning"] until the waters were dried up from upon the earth.

###### v8
And _he sent out a ^[Or "the"] dove_ ^[Literally "and he sent out a dove from him"] to see _whether_ the waters had subsided from upon the ground.

###### v9
But the dove did not find a resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark, for the waters _were still_ on the face of the earth. And he stretched out his hand and took her, and brought her to himself into the ark.

###### v10
And he waited another seven days, and _again he sent out_ ^[Literally "he added to send"] the dove from the ark.

###### v11
And the dove came to him _in the evening_, ^[Literally "at the time of the evening"] and behold, a freshly-picked olive tree leaf _was_ in her mouth. And Noah knew that the waters had subsided from upon the earth.

###### v12
And he waited _seven more days_, ^[Literally "again another seven days"] and he sent out the dove. But it did not return again to him.

###### v13
And it happened that, in the six hundred and first year, in the first _month_, on the first _day_ of the month, the waters dried up from upon the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked. And behold, the face of the ground was dried up.

###### v14
And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.

###### v15
And God spoke to Noah, saying:

###### v16
"Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you.

###### v17
Bring out with you all the living things which _are_ with you, from all the living creatures--birds, and animals, and everything that creeps on the earth, and let them swarm on the earth and be fruitful and multiply on the earth."

###### v18
So ^[Or "And"] Noah went out, with ^[Or "and"] his sons and his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.

###### v19
Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, _and_ everything _that_ moves upon the earth, according to its families, went out from the ark.

###### v20
And Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and he took from all the clean animals and from all the clean birds, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

###### v21
And Yahweh smelled the soothing fragrance, and Yahweh said _to himself_, ^[Literally "to his heart"] "_Never again will I curse_ ^[Literally "I will not add to curse again"] the ground for the sake of humankind, because the inclination of the heart of humankind _is_ evil from his youth. _Nor will I ever again destroy_ ^[Literally "And I will not add again to destroy"] all life as I have done.

###### v22
_As long as the earth endures_, ^[Literally "While all the days of the earth"] seed and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will not cease.
