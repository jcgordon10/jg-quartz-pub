###### v1
And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.

###### v2
And fear of you and dread of you shall be upon every animal of the earth, and on every bird of heaven, ^[Or "the sky"] _and_ on everything that moves upon the ground, and on all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they shall be given.

###### v3
Every moving thing that lives shall be for you as food. As _I gave_ the green plants to you, I have _now_ given you everything.

###### v4
Only you shall not eat _raw flesh with blood in it_. ^[Literally "flesh with its life, its blood"]

###### v5
And ^[Or "only"; the same word that occurs at the beginning of v. [[Gen-09#v4|4]]] _your lifeblood_ ^[Literally "your blood belonging to your life"] I will require; from _every animal_ ^[Literally "from the hand of every animal"] I will require it. And from the hand of humankind, from the hand of _each_ man to his brother I will require the life of humankind.

###### v6
"_As for_ the one shedding the blood of humankind,
by humankind his blood shall be shed,
for God made humankind in his own image.

###### v7
"And you, be fruitful and multiply, swarm on the earth and multiply in it."

###### v8
And God said to Noah and to his sons with him,

###### v9
"As for me, behold, I am establishing my covenant with you and with your seed after you,

###### v10
and with every living creature that _is_ with you--the birds, the animals, and every animal of the earth with you, from all _that_ came out of the ark to all the animals of the earth.

###### v11
I am establishing my covenant with you, that never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, nor will there ever be a flood that destroys the earth."

###### v12
And God said, "This _is_ the sign of the covenant that I am making between me and you, and between every living creature that _is_ with you for future generations.

###### v13
My bow I have set in the clouds, and it shall be for a sign of _the_ covenant between me and between the earth.

###### v14
And when I make clouds appear over the earth the bow shall be seen in the clouds.

###### v15
Then ^[Or "And"] I will remember my covenant that _is_ between me and you, and between every living creature, with all flesh. And the waters of a flood will never again _cause the destruction_ ^[Literally "be to destroy"] of all flesh.

###### v16
The bow shall be in the clouds, and I will see it, so as to remember _the_ everlasting covenant between God and between every living creature, with all flesh that _is_ upon the earth."

###### v17
And God said to Noah, "This _is_ the sign of the covenant which I am establishing between me and all flesh that _is_ upon the earth.

###### v18
Now ^[Or "And"] the sons of Noah who came out of the ark _were_ Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham _was_ the father of Canaan.)

###### v19
These three _were_ the sons of Noah, and from these _the whole earth was populated_. ^[Literally "all the earth branched out"]

###### v20
And Noah began _to be_ a man of the ground, and he planted a vineyard.

###### v21
And he drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he exposed himself in the midst of his tent.

###### v22
And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and he told his two brothers outside.

###### v23
Then ^[Or "And"] Shem and Japheth took a garment, and the two of them put _it_ on _their_ shoulders and, walking backward, they covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces _were turned_ backward, so that ^[Or "and"] they did not see the nakedness of their father.

###### v24
Then ^[Or "And"] Noah awoke from his drunkenness, ^[Or "his wine"] and he knew what his youngest son had done to him.

###### v25
And he said,
"Cursed _be_ Canaan,
a slave of slaves he shall be to his brothers."

###### v26
Then ^[Or "And"] he said,
"Blessed _be_ Yahweh, the God of Shem,
and let Canaan be a slave to them.

###### v27
May God make space for Japheth,
and let him dwell in the tents of Shem,
and let Canaan be a slave for him."

###### v28
And Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood.

###### v29
And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.
