###### v1
Now ^[Or "And"] the whole earth _had_ one language and the same words.

###### v2
And as people migrated ^[Or "set out"] from the east they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.

###### v3
And they said _to each other_, ^[Literally "each to his companion"] "Come, let us make bricks and _burn them thoroughly_." ^[Literally "burn to burning"] And they had brick for stone and they had tar for mortar.

###### v4
And they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower whose top _reaches to_ the heavens. And let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth."

Then ^[Or "And"] Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower that _humankind_ ^[Literally "sons of Adam" or "sons of humankind"] was building.

###### v6
And Yahweh said, "Behold, _they are one people with one language_, ^[Literally "one people and one language to all of them"] and _this is only the beginning of what they will do_. ^[Literally "and this they begin to do"] So ^[Or "And"] now nothing that they intend to do will be impossible for them.

###### v7
Come, let us go down and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand _each other's language_." ^[Literally "each the language of his companion"]

###### v8
So Yahweh scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth, and they stopped building the city.

###### v9
Therefore its name was called Babel, for there Yahweh confused the language of the whole earth, and there Yahweh scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
