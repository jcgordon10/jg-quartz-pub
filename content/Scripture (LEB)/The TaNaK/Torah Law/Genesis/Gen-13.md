###### v1
Then Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that _was_ with him. And Lot _went_ with him to the Negev.

###### v2
Now Abram _was_ very wealthy in livestock, in silver, and in gold.

###### v3
And he went according to his journey from the Negev, then to Bethel, to the place where his tent was at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,

###### v4
to the place where he had made an altar at the beginning. And Abram called on the name of Yahweh there.

###### v5
And Lot, who went with Abram, also had herds and tents.

###### v6
And the land could not _support them_ ^[Literally "lift them up"] _so as_ to live together, because their possessions were _so_ many that ^[Or "and"] they were not able to live together.

###### v7
And there was a quarrel between the herdsmen of the livestock of Abram and the herdsmen of the livestock of Lot. Now at that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land.

###### v8
Then Abram said to Lot, "Please, let there not be quarreling between me and you, and between my shepherds and your shepherds, for we men _are_ brothers.

###### v9
Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If _you want what is on_ the left, then I will go right; if _you want what is on_ the right, I will go left."

###### v10
And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw the whole plain of the Jordan, that all of it _was_ well-watered land--_this was_ before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah--like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt _in the direction of_ ^[Literally "your going"] Zoar.

###### v11
So ^[Or "And"] Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan. And Lot journeyed from the east, and so they separated _from each other_. ^[Literally "each from his brother"]

###### v12
Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot settled in the cities of the plain. And he pitched his tent toward Sodom.

###### v13
Now the men of Sodom _were extremely wicked sinners against Yahweh_. ^[Literally "_were_ wicked and sinners against Yahweh very"]

###### v14
And Yahweh said to Abram after Lot had separated from him, "Now, lift up your eyes and look from the place where you _are_ to the north, and to the south, and to the east and to the west,

###### v15
for all the land which you see I will give to you, and to your descendants, forever.

###### v16
I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth which, if anyone were able to count the dust of the earth, your descendants would be _so_ counted.

###### v17
Arise, go through the length of the land and through its breadth, for I will give it to you."

###### v18
So ^[Or "And"] Abram pitched his tent, and he came and settled at the oaks of Mamre, which _were_ at Hebron. And there he built an altar to Yahweh.
