###### v1
Now ^[Or "And"] Sarai, the wife of Abram, had borne him no children. And she had a female Egyptian servant, and her name _was_ Hagar.

###### v2
And Sarai said to Abram, "Look, please, Yahweh has prevented me from bearing children. Please go in to my servant; perhaps _I will have children by her_." ^[Literally "I will be built from her"] And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.

###### v3
Then ^[Or "And"] Sarai, the wife of Abram, took Hagar, her Egyptian servant, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband as his wife.

###### v4
And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And _when_ she ^[That is, Hagar] saw that she had conceived, then her mistress grew small in her eyes.

###### v5
And Sarai said to Abram, "may my harm _be_ upon you. _I had my servant sleep with you_, ^[Literally "I put my servant in your lap"] and _when_ she saw that she had conceived, _she no longer respected me_. ^[Literally "I grew small in her eyes"] May Yahweh judge between me and you!"

###### v6
And Abram said to Sarai, "Look, your servant _is_ _under your authority_. ^[Literally "in your hand"] Do to her that which _is_ good in your eyes." And Sarai mistreated her, and she ^[That is, Hagar] fled from her presence.

###### v7
And the angel of Yahweh found her at a spring of water in the wilderness, at the spring by the road of Shur.

###### v8
And he said to Hagar, the servant of Sarai, "_From where_ ^[Literally "where from this"] have you come, and where are you going?" And she said, "I am fleeing from the presence of Sarai my mistress."

###### v9
Then ^[Or "And"] the angel of Yahweh said to her, "Return to your mistress and submit yourself under _her authority_." ^[Literally "her hand"]

###### v10
And the angel of Yahweh said to her, "_I will greatly multiply_ ^[Literally "multiplying I will multiply"] your offspring, so that they cannot be counted for _their_ abundance."

###### v11
And the angel of Yahweh said to her:
"Behold, you are pregnant
and shall have a son.
And you shall call his name Ishmael,
for Yahweh has listened to your suffering.

###### v12
And he shall be a wild donkey of a man,
his hand _will be_ against everyone,
and the hand of everyone _will be_ against him,
and he will live _in hostility with all his brothers_." ^[Literally "against the face of all his brothers"]

###### v13
So ^[Or "And"] she called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her, "You _are_ El-Roi," ^["God of seeing"] for she said, "Here I have seen after he who sees me."
