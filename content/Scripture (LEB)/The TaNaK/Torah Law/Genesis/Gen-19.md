###### v1
And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening. And Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom. Then Lot saw _them_ and stood up to meet them. And he bowed down _with his_ face to the ground.

###### v2
And he said, "Behold, my lords, please turn aside into the house of your servant and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you can rise early and go on your way." And they said, "No, but we will spend the night in the square."

###### v3
But _he urged them strongly_, ^[Literally "he pressed upon them very"] and they turned aside with him and came into his house. And he made a meal for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

###### v4
Before they laid down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people _to the last man_, ^[Literally "from the end"] surrounded the house.

###### v5
And they called to Lot and said to him, "Where _are_ the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may know ^[Hebrew idiom for sexual intercourse (cp. [[Gen-04#v1|Gen 4:1]])] them."

###### v6
But Lot went out to them at the entrance, and he shut the door behind him.

###### v7
And he said, "No, my brothers, please do not do _such a_ wrong _thing_.

###### v8
Behold, I have two daughters who have not known ^[Hebrew idiom for sexual intercourse (cp. [[Gen-04#v1|Gen 4:1]])] a man. Please, let me bring them out to you; then do to them as _it seems_ good in your eyes. Only to these men do not do _this_ thing, since they came under _my roof_ ^[Literally "my beam"] for protection."

###### v9
But they said, "Step aside!" Then they said, "_This fellow_ ^[Literally "the one"] came to dwell as a foreigner and he acts as a judge! Now we shall do worse to you than them!" And they pressed very hard against the man, against Lot, and they drew near to break the door.

###### v10
Then the men reached out _with_ their hands and brought Lot in to them, into the house, and they shut the door.

###### v11
And the men who _were_ at the entrance of the house they struck with blindness, both small and great, and they were unable to find the entrance.

###### v12
Then the men said to Lot, "Who _is_ here with you? Bring out from the place _your_ sons-in-law, and your sons and your daughters, and all who _are_ with you in the city.

###### v13
For we are _about to_ destroy this place, because their cry has become great before Yahweh. Yahweh sent us to destroy it."

###### v14
Then Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law _who were_ taking ^[That is, marrying] his daughters and said, "Get up! Go out from this place, because Yahweh _is going_ to destroy the city!" But _it seemed like a joke_ ^[Literally "it was as one making fun"] in the eyes of his sons-in-law.

###### v15
And as the dawn came up the angels urged Lot saying, "Get up, take your wife and your two daughters _who are staying with you_, ^[Literally "who are found"] lest you be destroyed with the punishment of the city."

###### v16
But _when_ he lingered, the men seized him by his hand and his wife's hand, and his two daughters by hand, on account of the mercy of Yahweh upon him. And they brought him out and set him outside of the city.

###### v17
And after bringing them outside _one_ said, "Flee for your life; do not look behind you, and do not stand anywhere in the plain. Flee to the mountains lest you be destroyed."

###### v18
And Lot said to them, "No, please, my lords.

###### v19
Behold, your servant has found favor in your eyes and _you have shown me great kindness_ ^[Literally "your kindness which you have done to me you have made great"] in saving my life. But I cannot flee to the mountains, lest the disaster overtake me and I die.

###### v20
Behold, this city _is_ near _enough_ to flee there, and it _is a_ little _one_. Please, let me flee there. Is it not a little _one_? Then my life shall be saved."

###### v21
And he said to him, "Behold, _I will grant this favor as well_; ^[Literally "I am lifting up your face also concerning this thing"] that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.

###### v22
Escape there quickly, for I cannot do _this_ thing until you get there." Therefore, there name of the city was called Zoar.

###### v23
_After_ the sun _had risen_ ^[Literally "had gone out"] upon the earth and Lot had entered Zoar,

###### v24
Yahweh rained down from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh.

###### v25
And he overthrew those cities and the whole plain, and the inhabitants of the cities and the vegetation of the ground.

###### v26
But his ^[That is, Lot's] wife looked _back_, ^[Literally "behind him"] and she became a pillar of salt.

###### v27
And Abraham arose early in the morning _and went_ to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.

###### v28
And he looked down upon the surface of Sodom and Gomorrah, and upon the whole surface of the land, the plain. And he saw that, ^[Or "and"] behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a smelting furnace.

###### v29
So it was, when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out from the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.

###### v30
And Lot went out from Zoar and settled in the hill country ^[Or "mountain"] with his two daughters, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. So he lived in a cave, he and his two daughters.

###### v31
And the firstborn _daughter_ said to the younger one, "Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to come in to us according to the manner of all the land.

###### v32
Come, let us give our father wine to drink and let us lie with him ^[Idiom for "have sexual intercourse with him"] that _we may secure descendants through our father_." ^[Literally "that we might preserve offspring from our father"]

###### v33
And they gave their father wine to drink that night, and the firstborn went and lay with her father, but he did not know when she lay down or when she got up.

###### v34
And it happened _that_, the next day the firstborn said to the younger one, "Look, I laid with my father last night. Let us give him wine to drink also tonight, then go and lie with him that _we may secure descendants through our father_." ^[Literally "that we might preserve offspring from our father"]

###### v35
And they gave their father wine to drink again that night, and the younger got up and lay with him, but he did not know when she lay down or when she got up.

###### v36
And the two daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.

###### v37
The firstborn gave birth to a son, and she called his name Moab. He _is_ the father of Moab until this day.

###### v38
And the younger, she also gave birth to a son, and she called his name Ben-Ammi. He _is_ the father of the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Ammon"] until this day.
