###### v1
And Abraham journeyed from there to the land of the Negev, and he settled between Kadesh and Shur. And he dwelled as an alien in Gerar.

###### v2
And Abraham said about Sarah his wife, "She _is_ my sister." And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.

###### v3
And God came to Abimelech in a dream at night. And he said to him, "Look, you _are_ a dead man on account of the woman you have taken. For she _is_ _a married woman_." ^[Literally "married of a husband" or "a woman owned by a husband"]

###### v4
Now Abimelech had not approached her, so he said, "my Lord, will you even kill a righteous people?"

###### v5
Did not he himself say to me, 'She _is_ my sister'? And she herself said, 'He _is_ my brother.' With integrity of my heart and with cleanness of my hands I did this."

###### v6
Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, ^[Or "Also"] I know that in the integrity of your heart you did this, and I also _kept you from sinning_ ^[Literally "kept back from sinning"] against me. Therefore, I did not allow you to touch her.

###### v7
So now, return the wife of the man, for he _is_ a prophet, so that he will pray for you and you will live. And _if you do not return her_, ^[Literally "If there is not for you a returning"] know that you will certainly die, and all that _are_ yours."

###### v8
So Abimelech rose early in the morning. And he called all his servants and _told them all these things_, ^[Literally "said all these things in their ears"] and the men were very afraid.

###### v9
And Abimelech called for Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you that you brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? You have done things to me that should not be done."

###### v10
And Abimelech said to Abraham, "_What were you thinking_ ^[Literally "What have you seen?"] that you did this thing?"

###### v11
And Abraham said, "Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place; they will kill me on account of the matter of my wife.

###### v12
_Besides_, ^[Literally "And also moreover"] she _is_ my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother. And she became my wife.

###### v13
And it happened _that_ as God caused me to wander from the house of my father I said to her, 'This _is_ your loyal kindness that you must do for me at every place where we come: say concerning me, "He _is_ my brother."'"

###### v14
And Abimelech took sheep and cattle and male slaves and female slaves, and he gave _them_ to Abraham. And he returned Sarah his wife to him.

###### v15
And Abimelech said, "Here _is_ my land before you; settle _where it pleases you_." ^[Literally "in the good in your eyes"]

###### v16
And to Sarah he said, "Look, I have given a thousand _pieces of_ silver to your brother. It _shall be_ _an exoneration_. ^[Literally "a covering of the eyes"] _You are vindicated before all who are with you_." ^[Literally "to all who are with you and with all you are vindicated"]

###### v17
And Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his female servants so that they _could_ bear children _again_.

###### v18
For Yahweh had completely closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of the matter of Sarah, the wife of Abraham.
