###### v1
And Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said. And Yahweh did to Sarah as he had promised.

###### v2
And she conceived, and Sarah bore to Abraham a son in his old age at the appointed time that God had told him.

###### v3
And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.

###### v4
And Abraham circumcised Isaac his son _when he was_ eight days old, as God had commanded him.

###### v5
And Abraham _was_ one hundred years old when Isaac his son was born to him.

###### v6
And Sarah said, "God has made laughter for me; all who hear will laugh for me."

###### v7
And she said, "Who would announce to Abraham _that_ Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne a son _to Abraham_ in his old age."

###### v8
And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.

###### v9
And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne Abraham, mocking.

###### v10
Then she said to Abraham, "Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman will not be heir with my son, with Isaac."

###### v11
And the matter _displeased Abraham very much_ ^[Literally "was very bad in the eyes of Abraham"] on account of his son.

###### v12
Then God said to Abraham, "_Do not be displeased_ ^[Literally "Do not let it be bad"] on account of the boy and on account of the slave woman. _Listen to everything that Sarah said to you_, ^[Literally "Everything Sarah said to you, listen with respect to her voice"] for through Isaac _your_ offspring will be named.

###### v13
And I will also make the son of the slave woman into a nation, for he is your offspring."

###### v14
Then Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave _it_ to Hagar, putting _it_ on her shoulder. And he sent her away with the child, and she went, wandering about in the wilderness, in Beersheba.

###### v15
And when the water was finished from the skin, she put the child under one of the bushes.

###### v16
And she went and _she sat a good distance away_, ^[Literally "she sat with respect to her, opposite, far away, as the shooting of a bow"] for she said, "Let me not see the child's death." So she sat away from him and lifted up her voice and wept.

###### v17
And God heard the cry ^[Or "voice"] of the boy and the angel of God called to Hagar from the heavens and said to her, "_What is the matter_ ^[Literally "What to you"] Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the cry ^[Or "voice"] of the boy _from where he is_. ^[Literally "in which he _is_ there"]

###### v18
Get up, take up the boy and take him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation."

###### v19
And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave a drink to the boy.

###### v20
And God was with the boy, and he grew and lived in the wilderness. And he became _an expert with a bow_. ^[Literally "an archer with the bow"]

###### v21
And he lived in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.

###### v22
And it happened _that_ at that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, "God _is_ with you, in all that you do.

###### v23
So now, swear to me here by God _that_ you will not deal with me falsely, or with my descendants, or my posterity. According to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall _pledge_ to do with me and with the land where you have dwelled as an alien."

###### v24
And Abraham said, "I swear."

###### v25
Then Abraham complained to Abimelech on account of the well of water that servants of Abimelech had seized.

###### v26
And Abimelech said, "I do not know who did this thing, neither did you tell me, nor have I heard _of it_ except for today."

###### v27
And Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave _them_ to Abimelech. And the two of them _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] a covenant.

###### v28
Then Abraham set _off_ seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.

###### v29
And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What _is the meaning of_ these seven ewe-lambs that you have set _off_ by themselves?"

###### v30
And he said, "You shall take the seven ewe-lambs from my hand _as proof on my behalf_ ^[Literally "for the sake that it shall be a witness for me"] that I dug this well."

###### v31
Therefore that place is called Beersheba, because there the two of them swore an oath.

###### v32
And they _made_ ^[Literally "cut"] a covenant at Beersheba. And Abimelech, and Phicol his army commander stood and returned to the land of the Philistines.

###### v33
And he ^[That is, Abraham] planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of Yahweh, _the everlasting God_. ^[Literally "El-Olam"]

###### v34
And Abraham dwelled as an alien in the land of the Philistines many days.
