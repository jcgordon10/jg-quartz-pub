###### v1
And _Sarah lived_ ^[Literally "the lives of Sarah were"] one hundred and twenty-seven years; _these were_ the years of the life of Sarah.

###### v2
And Sarah died in Kiriath Arba; that _is_ Hebron, in the land of Canaan.

###### v3
And Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. And Abraham rose up from his dead, and he spoke to the Hittites ^[Or "sons of Heth"] _and_ said,

###### v4
"I _am_ a stranger and an alien among you; give to me _my own burial site_ ^[Literally "ownership of a grave"] among you so that I may bury my dead from before me."

###### v5
And the Hittites ^[Or "sons of Heth"] answered Abraham _and_ said to him,

###### v6
"Hear us, my lord, you _are_ a mighty prince ^[Or "prince of God"] in our midst. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial sites. None of us _will withhold his burial site_ ^[Literally "will withhold from himself his burial site] from you _for_ burying your dead."

###### v7
And Abraham rose up and bowed to the people of the land, to the Hittites. ^[Or "sons of Heth"]

###### v8
And he spoke with them, saying, "_If you are willing_ ^[Literally "if there is with your inner selves / souls"] _that_ I bury my dead from before me, hear me and intercede for me with Ephron the son of Zohar,

###### v9
that he may sell ^[Or "give"] to me the cave of Machpelah which _belongs to him_, ^[Literally "which _is_ to him"] which _is_ at the end of his field. At full value let him sell ^[Or "give"] _it_ to me in your midst as _a burial site_." ^[Literally "ownership of a grave"]

###### v10
Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites. ^[Or "sons of Heth"] And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites ^[Or "sons of Heth"] with respect to all _who were_ entering the gate of his city, _and_ said,

###### v11
"No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field and the cave which _is_ in it, I _also_ give it to you in the sight of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead."

###### v12
And Abraham bowed before the people of the land.

###### v13
And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, "_If only you will hear me_ ^[Literally "Only if you perhaps hear me"]--I give the price of the field. Take _it_ from me that I may bury my dead there."

###### v14
And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,

###### v15
"My lord, hear me. A _piece of_ land _worth_ four hundred shekels of silver--what _is_ that between me and you? Bury your dead."

###### v16
Then Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed for Ephron the silver that he had named ^[Or "spoken"] in the hearing of the Hittites: ^[Or "sons of Heth"] four hundred shekels of silver _at the merchants' current rate_. ^[Literally "passing to the merchant"]

###### v17
So the field of Ephron which _was_ in the Machpelah, which _was_ near Mamre--the field and the cave which _was_ in it, with all the trees that _were_ in the field, which _were_ within all its surrounding boundaries--_passed_ ^[Literally "went up"]

###### v18
to Abraham as a property in the presence of the Hittites, ^[Or "sons of Heth"] with respect to all _who were_ entering the gate of his city.

###### v19
And thus afterward Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah near Mamre; that _is_ Hebron, in the land of Canaan.

###### v20
And the field and the cave which _was_ in it _passed_ ^[Literally "went up"] to Abraham as _a burial site_ ^[Literally "ownership of a grave"] from the Hittites. ^[Or "sons of Heth"]
