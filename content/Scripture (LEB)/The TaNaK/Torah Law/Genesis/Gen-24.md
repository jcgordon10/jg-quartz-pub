###### v1
Now Abraham _was_ old, _advanced in age_, ^[Literally "going in the days"] and Yahweh had blessed Abraham in everything.

###### v2
And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who had charge of all he had, "Please put your hand under my thigh

###### v3
that I may make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose midst I am dwelling,

###### v4
but that you will go to my land and to my family, and take a wife for my son, for Isaac."

###### v5
And the servant said to him, "Perhaps the woman will not be willing _to follow_ ^[Literally "to go after"] me to this land--must I then return your son to the land from whence you came?"

###### v6
Abraham said to him, "_You must take care_ ^[Literally "let it be careful to you"] that you do not return my son there.

###### v7
Yahweh, the God of heaven who took me from the house of my father and from the land of my family, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, 'to your offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.

###### v8
And if the woman is not willing _to follow_ ^[Literally "to go after"] you, then you shall be released from this oath of mine--only you must not return my son there."

###### v9
Then the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and he swore to him concerning this matter.

###### v10
And the servant took ten camels from his master's camels, and he went with all _kinds of_ his master's good things in his hand. And he arose and went to Aram-Naharaim, to the city of Nahor.

###### v11
And he made the camels kneel outside the city at the well of water, at the time of evening, toward the time _the women_ went out to draw water.

###### v12
And he said, "O Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show loyal love to my master Abraham.

###### v13
Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are going out to draw water.

###### v14
And let it be _that_ the girl to whom I shall say, 'Please, offer your jar that I may drink' and _who_ says, 'Drink--and I will also water your camels,' she _is the one_ you have chosen for your servant, for Isaac. By her I will know that you have shown loyal love to my master."

###### v15
And it happened _that_ before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah--who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, the brother of Abraham--came out, and her jar _was_ on her shoulder.

###### v16
Now the girl _was_ very pleasing in appearance. _She was_ a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.

###### v17
And the servant ran to meet her. And he said, "Please, let me drink a little of the water from your jar."

###### v18
And she said, "Drink, my lord." And she quickly lowered her jar in her hand and gave him a drink.

###### v19
When ^[Or "And"] she finished giving him a drink she said, "I will also draw water for your camels until they finish drinking."

###### v20
And she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water. And she drew water for all his camels.

###### v21
And the man _was_ gazing at her silently to know _if_ Yahweh had made his journey successful or not.

###### v22
And it happened _that_ as the camels finished drinking the man took a gold ring of a half shekel in weight and two bracelets for her arms, ten shekels in weight,

###### v23
and said, "Please tell me, whose daughter _are_ you? Is there a place _at_ the house of your father for us to spend the night?"

###### v24
And she said to him, "I _am_ the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."

###### v25
Then she said to him, "We have both straw and fodder in abundance, as well as a place to spend the night."

###### v26
And the man knelt down and worshiped Yahweh.

###### v27
And he said, "Blessed _be_ Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld ^[Or "abandoned"] his loyal love and his faithfulness from my master. I _was_ on the way _and_ Yahweh led me _to_ the house of my master's brother."

###### v28
Then the girl ran and reported these things to the household of her mother.

###### v29
Now Rebekah had a brother, and his name _was_ Laban. And Laban ran out to the man toward the spring.

###### v30
And when he saw the ring and the bracelets on the arms of his sister and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, _who_ said, "Thus the man spoke to me," he went to the man. And behold, _he was_ standing with the camels at the spring.

###### v31
And he said, "Come, O blessed _one_ of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? Now I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."

###### v32
And the man came to the house and unloaded the camels. And he gave straw and fodder to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who _were_ with him.

###### v33
_And food was placed before him_ ^[Literally "And it was placed before him"] to eat. And he said, "I will not eat until _I have told my errand_." ^[Literally "I have spoken my word"] And he said, "Speak."

###### v34
And he said, "I _am_ the servant of Abraham.

###### v35
Now Yahweh has blessed my master exceedingly, and he has become great. He has given to him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male slaves and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.

###### v36
And Sarah, the wife of my master, has borne a son to my master after her old age. And he ^[That is, Abraham] has given to him all that he has.

###### v37
And my master made me swear, saying, 'Do not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I am living.

###### v38
But you shall go to the house of my father, and to my family, and you shall take a wife for my son.'

###### v39
And I said to my master, 'Perhaps the woman will not _follow_ ^[Literally "go after"] me.'

###### v40
And he said to me, 'Yahweh, before whom I have walked, shall send his angel with you and will make your journey successful. And you shall take a wife for my son from my family, and from the house of my father.

###### v41
Then you shall be released from my oath, when you come to my family. And if they will not give _a woman_ to you, then you will be released from my oath.'

###### v42
Then today I came to the spring, and I said, 'O Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, _if you would please make my journey successful_, ^[Literally "if there is you making successful my journey"] upon which I am going.

###### v43
Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let it be _that_ the young woman who comes out to draw water and to whom I say, "Please give me a little water to drink from your jar,"

###### v44
let her say to me, "Drink; I will also draw water for your camels," she _is_ the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for the son of my master.'

###### v45
I had not yet finished speaking to myself ^[Or "to my heart"] when, behold, Rebekah _was_ coming out with ^[Or "and"] her jar on her shoulder. And she went down to the spring and drew water. And I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.'

###### v46
And she hastened and let down her jar _from her shoulder_ ^[Literally "from upon her"] and said, 'Drink, and I will give a drink to your camels also.' Then I drank and she gave a drink to the camels also.

###### v47
Then I asked her and said, 'Whose daughter _are_ you?' And she said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.' And I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.

###### v48
And I knelt down and worshiped Yahweh, and I praised Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who led me on the right way, to take the daughter of the brother of my master for his son.

###### v49
So now, _if you are going to deal loyally and truly_ ^[Literally "if there is you doing loyal love and faithfulness"] with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, so that I may turn to _the_ right or to _the_ left." ^[An idiom for "so that I might know what to do"]

###### v50
Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and they said, "The matter has gone out from Yahweh; we are not able to speak bad or good to you.

###### v51
Here _is_ Rebekah before you. Take _her_ and go; let her be a wife for the son of your master as Yahweh has spoken."

###### v52
And it happened _that_ when the servant of Abraham heard their words he bowed down to the ground to Yahweh.

###### v53
And the servant brought out silver jewelry and gold jewelry, and garments, and he gave _them_ to Rebekah. And he gave precious gifts to her brother and to her mother.

###### v54
And he and the men who _were_ with him ate and drank, and they spent the night. And they got up in the morning, and he said, "Let me go to my master."

###### v55
And her brother and her mother said, "Let the girl remain with us ten days _or so_; after _that_ she may go."

###### v56
And he said to them, "Do not delay me. Now, Yahweh has made my journey successful. Let me go. I must go to my master."

###### v57
And they said, "Let us call the girl and ask _her opinion_." ^[Literally "her mouth"]

###### v58
And they called Rebekah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" And she said, "I will go."

###### v59
So they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and the servant of Abraham and his men.

###### v60
And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "You _are_ our sister; may you become countless thousands; and may your offspring take possession of the gate of his enemies."

###### v61
And Rebekah and her maidservants arose, and they mounted the camels and _followed_ ^[Literally "went after"] the man. And the servant took Rebekah and left.

###### v62
Now Isaac _was_ coming from the direction of Beer-Lahai-Roi. And he _was_ living in the land of the Negev.

###### v63
And Isaac went out to meditate in the field _early in the evening_, ^[Literally "at the turning of evening"] and he lifted up his eyes and saw--behold, camels were coming.

###### v64
And Rebekah lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac. And she got down from the camel.

###### v65
And she said to the servant, "Who _is_ this man walking around in the field to meet us?" And the servant said, "That _is_ my master." And she took her ^[Or "the"] veil and covered herself.

###### v66
And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.

###### v67
And Isaac brought her to the tent of Sarah his mother. And he took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And Isaac loved her and was comforted after _the death of_ his mother.
