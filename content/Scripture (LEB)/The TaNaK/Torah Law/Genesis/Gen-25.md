And Yahweh said to her, "Two nations _are_ in your womb, and two peoples _from birth_ ^[Literally "from your bowels"] shall be divided. And _one people shall be stronger than the other_. ^[Literally "people than people shall be stronger"] And _the_ elder shall serve _the_ younger."

And the first came out red, all _his body_ ^[Literally "of him"] _was_ like a hairy coat, so they called his name Esau.
