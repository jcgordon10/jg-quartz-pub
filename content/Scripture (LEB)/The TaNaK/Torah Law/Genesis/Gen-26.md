###### v1
And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine which was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, to Gerar.

###### v2
And Yahweh appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land which I will show to you.

###### v3
Dwell as an alien in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you, for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham you father.

###### v4
And I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and I will give to your descendants all these lands. And all nations of the earth will be blessed through your offspring,

###### v5
because Abraham listened to my voice and kept my charge: my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."

###### v6
So Isaac settled in Gerar.

###### v7
When the men of the place asked concerning his wife, he said, "She _is_ my sister," for he was afraid to say, "my wife," thinking ^[Or "lest"] "the men of the place will kill me on account of Rebekah, for _she was beautiful_." ^[Literally "good of appearance"]

###### v8
And it happened _that_, _when he had been there a long time_, ^[Literally "when the days there were long to him"] Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked through the window, and saw--behold--Isaac _was_ fondling Rebekah his wife.

###### v9
And Abimelech called Isaac ^[Or "to Isaac"] and said, "Surely she _is_ your wife. Now why did you say 'She _is_ my sister'?" And Isaac said to him, "Because I thought I would die on account of her."

###### v10
And Abimelech said, "What _is_ this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have slept with your wife! Then you would have brought guilt upon us!"

###### v11
Then Abimelech instructed all the people, saying, "The _one who_ touches this man or his wife shall certainly die."

###### v12
And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in that _same_ year a hundredfold, and Yahweh blessed him.

###### v13
And the man _became wealthier and wealthier_ ^[Literally "became great and went, going and became great"] until he was exceedingly wealthy.

###### v14
And he possessed sheep and cattle and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him.

###### v15
And the Philistines stopped up all the wells that the servants of his father had dug in the days of Abraham his father. They filled them with earth.

###### v16
And Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go _away_ from us, for you have become much too powerful for us."

###### v17
So Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there.

###### v18
And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after the death of Abraham. And he gave ^[Or "called"] to them _the same names_ ^[Literally "names as names"] which his father had given ^[Or "called"] them.

###### v19
And when the servants of Isaac dug in the valley, they found a well of fresh water there.

###### v20
Then the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying, "The water is ours." And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.

###### v21
And they dug another well, and they quarreled over it also. And he called its name Sitnah.

###### v22
Then he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. And he called its name Rehoboth, and said, "Now Yahweh has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."

###### v23
And from there he went up to Beersheba.

###### v24
And Yahweh appeared to him that night and said, "I _am_ the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I _am_ with you, and I will bless you and make your descendants numerous for the sake of my servant Abraham."

###### v25
And he built an altar there and called on the name of Yahweh. And he pitched his tent there, and the servants of Isaac dug a well there.

###### v26
Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol his army commander.

###### v27
And Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me? You hate me and sent me away from you."

###### v28
And they said, "We see clearly that Yahweh has been with you, so we thought ^[Or "said"] let there be an oath between us--between us and you--and let us _make_ ^[Literally "cut"] a covenant with you

###### v29
that you may not do us harm just as we have not touched you, but have only done good to you and sent you away in peace. You _are_ now blessed by Yahweh."

###### v30
So he made a meal for them, and they ate and drank.

###### v31
And they arose early in the morning and each one swore to the other, ^[Or "to his brother"] and Isaac sent them away. And they left him in peace.

###### v32
And it happened _that_ on that same day the servants of Isaac came and told him about the well that they had dug. And they said, "We have found water!"

###### v33
And he called it Sheba. Therefore the name of the city _is_ Beersheba unto this day.

###### v34
And _when_ Esau was forty years old he took as wife Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite.

###### v35
And _they made life bitter_ ^[Literally "they caused bitterness of spirit"] for Isaac and Rebekah.
