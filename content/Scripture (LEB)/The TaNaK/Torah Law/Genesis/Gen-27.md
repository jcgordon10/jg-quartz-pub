###### v1
And it happened _that_ when Isaac _was_ old and _his eyesight was weak_, ^[Literally "his eyes were weak from seeing"] he called Esau his older son and said to him, "My son." And he ^[That is, Esau] said to him, "Here I _am_."

###### v2
And he said, "Look, I _am_ old; I do not know the day of my death.

###### v3
So now, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt food for me.

###### v4
Then make for me tasty food like I love, and bring _it_ to me. And I will eat _it_ so that I ^[Or "my soul"] can bless you before I die.

###### v5
Now Rebekah _was_ listening as Isaac spoke to Esau his son, and _when_ Esau went to the field to hunt wild game to bring _back_,

###### v6
Rebekah said to Jacob her son, "Look, I heard your father speaking to Esau your brother saying,

###### v7
'Bring wild game to me and prepare tasty food so I can eat _it_ and bless you before Yahweh before my death.'

###### v8
So now, my son, listen to my voice, to what I command you.

###### v9
Go to the flock and take two good young goats from it for me, and I will prepare them _as_ tasty food for your father, just as he likes.

###### v10
Then you must take it to your father and he will eat _it_ so that he may bless you before his death."

###### v11
Then Jacob said to his mother, "Behold, Esau my brother _is_ a hairy man, but I _am_ a smooth man.

###### v12
Perhaps my father will feel me and I will be in his eyes _as_ a mocker, and he will bring upon me a curse and not a blessing."

###### v13
Then his mother said to him, "Your curse be upon me, my son, only listen to my voice--go and get _them_ for me."

###### v14
So he went and took _them_, and brought _them_ to his mother, and his mother prepared tasty food as his father liked.

###### v15
Then Rebekah took _some of_ her older son Esau's best garments that _were_ with her in the house, and she put _them_ on Jacob her younger son.

###### v16
And she put the skins of the young goats over his hands and over the smooth _part of_ his neck.

###### v17
And she put the tasty food and the bread that she had made into the hand of Jacob, her son.

###### v18
And he went to his father and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I _am_. Who _are_ you, my son?"

###### v19
And Jacob said to his father, "I _am_ Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please get up, sit up and eat from my wild game so that you ^[Or "your soul"] may bless me."

###### v20
Then Isaac said to his son, "_How_ ^[Literally "what is this?"] did you find _it_ so quickly, my son?" And he said, "Because Yahweh your God _caused me to find it_." ^[Literally "made it to happen before me"]

###### v21
Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Please, come near and let me feel you, my son. _Are you really_ ^[Literally "are you this one?"] my son Esau or not?"

###### v22
And Jacob drew near to Isaac his father. And he felt him and said, "The voice _is_ the voice of Jacob, but the hands _are_ the hands of Esau."

###### v23
And he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like the hands of Esau his brother. And he blessed him.

###### v24
And he said, "_Are you really_ ^[Literally "are you this one?"] my son Esau?" And he said, "I _am_."

###### v25
Then he said, "Bring _it_ near to me that I may eat from the game of my son, so that I ^[Or "my soul"] may bless you." And he brought _it_ to him, and he ate. And he brought wine to him, and he drank.

###### v26
Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come near and kiss me, my son."

###### v27
And he drew near and kissed him. And he ^[That is, Isaac] smelled the smell of his garments, and he blessed him and said,
"Look, the smell of my son _is_ like the smell of a field that Yahweh has blessed!

###### v28
May God give you of the dew of heaven
and of the fatness of the earth,
and abundance of grain and new wine.

###### v29
Let peoples serve you,
and nations bow down to you;
Be lord of your brothers,
and may the sons of your mother bow down to you.
Cursed be those cursing you,
and blessed be those blessing you."

###### v30
And as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, _immediately after_ ^[Literally "it was only"] Jacob had gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came _back_ from his hunting.

###### v31
He too prepared tasty food and brought _it_ to his father. And he said to his father, "Let my father arise and eat from the wild game of his son, that you ^[Or "your soul"] may bless me."

###### v32
And Isaac his father said to him, "Who _are_ you?" And he said, "I _am_ your son, your firstborn, Esau."

###### v33
Then Isaac _trembled violently_. ^[Literally "trembled a great trembling unto exceeding"] Then he said, "Who then _was_ he that hunted wild game and brought _it_ to me, and I ate _it_ all before you came, and I blessed him? Moreover, he will be blessed!"

###### v34
When Esau heard the words of his father he cried out _with_ a great and exceedingly bitter cry of distress. And he said to his father, "Bless me as well, my father!"

###### v35
And he said, "Your brother came in deceit and took your blessing."

###### v36
Then he said, "_Isn't that why he is named Jacob_? ^[Literally "that his name is called Jacob?"] He has deceived me these two times. He took my birthright and, look, now he has taken my blessing!" Then he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"

###### v37
Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, "Behold, I have made him lord over you and I have given him all his brothers as servants, and _with_ grain and wine I have sustained him. Now what can I do for you, my son?"

###### v38
And Esau said to his father, "Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me also, my father!" And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.

###### v39
Then Isaac his father answered and said to him,
"Your home shall be from ^[Or "away from"] the fatness of the land,
and from the dew of heaven above.

###### v40
But by your sword you shall live,
and you shall serve your brother.
But it shall be _that_ when free yourself
you shall tear off his yoke from your neck.

###### v41
Then Esau held a grudge against Jacob on account of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, ^[That is, "to himself"] "The days of mourning for my father are coming, then I will kill Jacob my brother."

###### v42
But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called for her younger son Jacob. And she said to him, "Look, Esau your brother _is_ consoling himself concerning you, _intending_ to kill you.

###### v43
Now then, my son, listen to my voice; arise and flee to Haran to Laban my brother.

###### v44
Stay with him a few days until the wrath of your brother has turned--

###### v45
until the anger of your brother turns from you and he has forgotten what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I lose the two of you in one day?"

###### v46
Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I loathe my life because of the Hittite women. ^[Or "daughters of the Hittites"] If Jacob takes a wife from Hittite women ^[Or "daughters of the Hittites"] like these, from the _native women_, ^[Literally "daughters of the land"] _what am I living for_?" ^[Literally "What is life to me?"]
