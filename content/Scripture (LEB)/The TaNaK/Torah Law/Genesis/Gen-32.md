###### v1
And Jacob went on his way, and angels of God met him.

###### v2
And when he saw them, Jacob said, "This _is_ the camp of God!" And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

###### v3
Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the territory of Edom.

###### v4
And he instructed them, saying, "Thus you must say to my lord, to Esau, 'Thus says your servant Jacob, I have dwelled as an alien with Laban, and I have remained _there_ until now.

###### v5
And I have acquired cattle, male donkeys, flocks, and male and female slaves, and I have sent to tell my lord, to find favor in your eyes.'"

###### v6
And the messengers returned to Jacob _and_ said, "We came to your brother, to Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men _are_ with him."

###### v7
Then Jacob was very frightened and distressed. So he divided the people, flocks, cattle, and camels that _were_ with him into two companies.

###### v8
And he thought, "If Esau comes to one company and destroys it, the remaining company will be _able_ to escape."

###### v9
Then Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Yahweh, who said to me, 'Return to your land and to your family, and I will deal well with you.'

###### v10
_I am not worthy_ ^[Literally "I am small"] of all the loyal love and all the faithfulness that you have shown ^[Or "done"] your servant, for with _only_ my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.

###### v11
Please rescue me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and attack mother and children _alike_.

###### v12
Now you yourself said, 'I will surely deal well with you and make your offspring as the sand of the sea that cannot be counted for abundance.'"

###### v13
And he lodged there that night. Then he took _from what he had with him_ ^[Literally "from that which was going from his hand"] a gift for Esau his brother:

###### v14
two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, twenty rams,

###### v15
thirty milk camels with their young, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten male donkeys.

###### v16
And he put _them_ under the hand of his servants, _herd by herd_, ^[Literally "every herd by its own"] and said to his servants, "Cross on ahead before me, and put some distance _between herds_. ^[Literally "between a herd and between a herd"]

###### v17
And he instructed the foremost, saying, "When Esau my brother comes upon you and asks you, saying, 'Whose _are_ you and where are you going? To whom do these _animals_ belong ahead of you?'

###### v18
Then you must say, 'To your servant, to Jacob. It _is_ a gift sent to my lord, to Esau. Now behold, he _is_ also _coming_ after us.'"

###### v19
And he also instructed the second _servant_ and the third, and everyone _else_ who _was_ behind the herds, saying, "You must speak to Esau according to this word when you find him.

###### v20
And moreover, you shall say, 'Look, your servant Jacob _is_ behind us.'" For he thought, "_Let me appease him_ ^[Literally "let me cover his face"] with the gift going before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will _show me favor_." ^[Literally "lift up my face"]

###### v21
So the gift passed on before him, but he himself spent that night in the camp.

###### v22
That night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.

###### v23
And he took them and sent them across the stream. Then he sent across all his possessions.

###### v24
And Jacob remained alone, and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the dawn.

###### v25
And when he ^[That is, the man] saw that he could not prevail against him, he struck his hip socket, so that Jacob's hip socket was sprained as he wrestled with him.

###### v26
Then he ^[That is, the man] said, "Let me go, for dawn is breaking." But he answered, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."

###### v27
Then he said to him, "What _is_ your name?" And he said, "Jacob."

###### v28
And he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, ^["Israel" means "he struggles with God," or "God struggles"] for you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed."

###### v29
Then Jacob asked and said, "Please tell me your name." And he said, "Why do you ask this--for my name?" And he blessed him there.

###### v30
Then Jacob called the name of the place Peniel _which means_ "I have seen God face to face and my life was spared."

###### v31
Then the sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip.

###### v32
Therefore the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] do not eat the sinew of the sciatic nerve that _is_ upon the socket of the hip unto this day, because he struck the socket of the thigh of Jacob at the sinew of the sciatic nerve.
