###### v1
And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked. And behold, Esau _was_ coming and four hundred men _were_ with him. And he ^[That is, Jacob] divided the children among Leah and among Rachel, and among the two of his female servants.

###### v2
And he put the female slaves and their children first, then Leah and her children next, then Rachel with Joseph last.

###### v3
And he himself passed on before them and bowed down to the ground seven times until he came to his brother.

###### v4
But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell upon his neck and kissed him, and they wept.

###### v5
Then Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said, "Who _are_ these with you?" And he said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."

###### v6
Then the female servants drew near, they and their children, and they bowed down.

###### v7
Then Leah and her children drew near and bowed down, and afterward Joseph and Rachel drew near and they bowed down.

###### v8
And he ^[That is, Esau] said, "_What do you mean by_ ^[Literally "What to you?"] all this company that I have met?" Then he said, "To find favor in the eyes of my lord."

###### v9
Then Esau said, "_I have enough_ ^[Literally "There is to me abundance"] my brother; _keep what you have_." ^[Literally "let what is to you be to you"]

###### v10
And Jacob said, "No, please, if I have found favor in your eyes, you must take my gift from my hand, for then I have seen your face _which is_ like seeing the face of God, and you have received me.

###### v11
Please take my gift which has been brought to you, for God has dealt graciously with me, and because _I have enough_." ^[Literally "There is to me abundance"] And he urged him, so he took _it_.

###### v12
Then he ^[That is, Esau] said, "Let us journey and go _on_, and I will go ahead of you."

###### v13
But he said to him, "My lord knows that the children _are_ frail, and the flocks and the cattle _which are_ nursing _are a concern_ to me. Now _if_ they drove them hard for a day all the flocks would die.

###### v14
Let my lord pass on before his servant and I will move along slowly at the pace ^[Or "foot"] of the livestock that are ahead of me, and at the pace ^[Or "foot"] of the children until I come to my lord in Seir."

###### v15
And Esau said, "Let me leave some of my people with you." But he said, "_What need is there_? ^[Literally "What is this?"] Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."

###### v16
So Esau turned that day on his way to Seir.

###### v17
But Jacob traveled on to Succoth, and he built for himself a house, and he made shelters for his livestock. Therefore he called the name of the place Succoth.

###### v18
And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem which _is_ in the land of Canaan, _on his way_ ^[Literally "at his coming"] from Paddan-Aram. And he camped before the city.

###### v19
And he bought a piece of land where he pitched his tent for one hundred pieces of money ^[Hebrew _kesitah_] from the hand of the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem.

###### v20
And there he erected an altar and called it "El Elohe Israel." ^[That is, "_El_ the God of Israel"]
