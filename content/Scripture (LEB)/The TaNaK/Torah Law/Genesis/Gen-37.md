###### v1
And Jacob settled in the land of the sojourning of his father, in the land of Canaan.

###### v2
These _are_ the generations ^[Or "family records"] of Jacob. Joseph, _being_ seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers. Now he _was_ a helper with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, the wives of his father. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to his father.

###### v3
Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, for he _was_ a son of his old age. And he made a robe with long sleeves ^[Or "of many colors"] for him.

###### v4
When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and were not able to speak peaceably to him.

###### v5
And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told _it_ to his brothers. And _they hated him even more_. ^[Literally "they added still to hate him"]

###### v6
And he said to them, "Listen now to this dream that I dreamed.

###### v7
Now behold, we were binding sheaves in the midst of the field and, behold, my sheaf stood up and it remained standing. Then behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf."

###### v8
Then his brothers said to him, "Will you really rule over us?" And _they hated him even more_ ^[Literally "they added still to hate him"] on account of his dream and because of his words.

###### v9
Then he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brothers. And he said, "Behold, I dreamed a dream again, and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."

###### v10
And he told _it_ to his father and to his brothers. And his father rebuked him and said to him, "What _is_ this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down to the ground to you?"

###### v11
And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter _in mind_.

###### v12
Now his brothers went to pasture the flock of their father in Shechem.

###### v13
And Israel said to Joseph, "Are not your brothers pasturing in Shechem? Come, let me send you to them." And he said, "Here I _am_."

###### v14
Then he said to him, "Go now, see _if it goes well for your brothers and for the flock_, ^[Literally "see the peace of your brothers and the peace of the flock"] then return word to me." And he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he arrived at Shechem.

###### v15
And a man found him, and behold, he ^[That is, Joseph] was wandering about in a field. And the man asked him, "What do you seek?"

###### v16
And he said, "I am seeking my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are pasturing."

###### v17
And the man said, "They have moved on from here, for I heard _them_ saying, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" Then Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.

###### v18
And they saw him from a distance. And before he drew near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.

###### v19
And each said to his brothers, "Look, this master of dreams is coming.

###### v20
Now then, come, let us kill him and throw him in one of the pits. Then we will say a wild animal devoured him. Then we will see what his dreams become."

###### v21
And Reuben heard _it_ and delivered him from their hand and said, "We must not take his life."

###### v22
And Reuben said to them, "You must not shed blood. Throw him into this pit that _is_ in the desert, but do not lay a hand on him"--so that he might rescue him from their hand to return him to his father.

###### v23
And it happened _that_ as Joseph came to his brothers they stripped Joseph of his robe, the robe with long sleeves, ^[Or "of many colors"] that _was_ upon him.

###### v24
And they took him and threw him into the pit (the pit _was_ empty; there was no water in it).

###### v25
Then they sat down to eat _some_ food. And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead. And their camels were carrying aromatic gum and balm and spices _on the way_ ^[Literally "going to bring down"] to Egypt.

###### v26
Then Judah said to his brothers, "What profit _is there_ if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?

###### v27
Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, but our hand shall not be against him, for he _is_ our brother, our own flesh." And his brothers agreed.

###### v28
Then Midianite traders passed by. And they ^[That is, the brothers] drew Joseph up and brought _him_ up from the pit, and they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty _pieces of_ silver. And they brought Joseph to Egypt.

###### v29
Then Reuben returned to the pit and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit. And he tore his clothes.

###### v30
And he returned to his brothers and said, "The boy _is gone_! ^[Literally "is not"] Now I, _what can I do_?" ^[Literally "where am I going?"]

###### v31
Then they took the robe of Joseph and slaughtered a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood.

###### v32
Then they sent the robe with long sleeves ^[Or "of many colors"] and they brought _it_ to their father and said, "We found this; please examine _it_. _Is_ it the robe of your son or not?"

###### v33
And he recognized it and said, "The robe of my son! A wild animal has devoured him! Joseph _is_ surely torn to pieces!"

###### v34
And Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.

###### v35
And all his sons and daughters tried to console him, but he refused to be consoled. And he said, "No, I shall go down to my son, to Sheol, mourning." And his father wept for him.

###### v36
And the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh, a commander of the imperial guard.
