###### v1
And it happened _that_ at that time Judah went down from his brothers and pitched his tent near a certain Adullamite, whose name _was_ Hirah.

###### v2
And Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite there whose name _was_ Shua. And he took her and went in to her.

###### v3
And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.

###### v4
And she conceived again and bore a son, and he called his name Onan.

###### v5
And once again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. And he ^[That is, Judah] was in Chezib when she bore him.

###### v6
And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name _was_ Tamar.

###### v7
And Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh killed him.

###### v8
Then Judah said to Onan, "Go in to the wife of your brother and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother."

###### v9
But Onan knew that the offspring would not be for him, so whenever he went in to the wife of his brother he would waste _it_ on the ground ^[Meaning he would spill his semen on the ground] so as not to give offspring to his brother.

###### v10
And what he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh, so he killed him also.

###### v11
Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, "Stay a widow in your father's house until Shelah my son grows up," for _he feared he would also die_ ^[Literally "he thought lest he also will die"] like his brother. So Tamar went and stayed in the house of her father.

###### v12
_And in the course of time_ ^[Literally "And the days increased"] the daughter of Shua, the wife of Judah, died. When Judah was consoled he went up to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite, to Timnah.

###### v13
And it was told to Tamar, saying, "Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."

###### v14
So she removed the clothes of her widowhood and covered _herself_ with the veil and disguised herself. And she sat at the entrance to Eynayim, which _is_ on the way to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah was grown but she had not been given to him as a wife.

###### v15
And Judah saw her and reckoned her to _be_ a prostitute, for she had covered her face.

###### v16
And he turned aside to her at the roadside and said, "Please come, let me come in to you," for he did not know that she _was_ his daughter-in-law. And she said, "What will you give to me that you may come in to me?"

###### v17
And he said, "I will send a kid from the goats of the flock." And she said, "_Only_ if you give a pledge until you send _it_."

###### v18
And he said, "What _is_ the pledge that I must give to you?" And she said, "your seal, your cord, and your staff that _is_ in your hand." And he gave _them_ to her and went in to her. And she conceived by him.

###### v19
And she arose and left, and she removed her veil from herself and put on the garments of her widowhood.

###### v20
And Judah sent the kid from the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to take _back_ the pledge from the hand of the woman, but he could not find her.

###### v21
So he asked the men of her place, saying, "Where _is_ that cult prostitute _that was_ at Eynayim by the roadside?" And they said, "There is no cult prostitute here."

###### v22
Then he returned to Judah and said, "I could not find her. Morever, the men of the place said, 'There is no cult prostitute here.'"

###### v23
And Judah said, "Let her take _them_ for herself, lest we be _laughed at_. ^[Literally "as contempt"] Behold, I sent this kid, but you could not find her."

###### v24
And _about three months later_ ^[Literally "it happened about three months"] it was told to Judah, "Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the whore, and now, behold, she has conceived by prostitution." And Judah said, "Bring her out and let her be burned."

###### v25
She was brought out, but she sent to her father-in-law saying, "By the man to whom these _belong_ I have conceived." And she said, "Now discern ^[Or "examine"] to whom these _belong_: the seal and cord and the staff."

###### v26
Then Judah recognized _them_ and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not know ^["Know" is a euphemism for "have sexual relations with"] her again.

###### v27
And it happened _that_ at the time she gave birth that, behold, twins _were_ in her womb.

###### v28
And it happened _that_ at her labor one _child_ put out a hand. And the midwife took _it_ and tied a crimson thread on his hand saying, "This _one_ came out first."

###### v29
Then his hand drew back and, behold, his brother came out, and she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" And she called his name Perez.

###### v30
And afterward his brother who _had_ the crimson thread on his hand came out. And his name was called Zerah.
