###### v1
Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh, commander of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.

###### v2
And Yahweh was with Joseph, and he became a successful man. And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian.

###### v3
And his master observed that Yahweh _was_ with him, and everything that _was_ in his hand to do Yahweh made successful.

###### v4
And Joseph found favor in his eyes and he served him. Then he appointed him ^[That is, Joseph] over his house and all that he owned he put into his hand.

###### v5
And it happened _that_ from the time he appointed him over his house and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph. And the blessing of Yahweh was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.

###### v6
And he left all that he had in the hand of Joseph, and _he did not worry about anything_ ^[Literally "he did not know with him anything"] except the food that he ate. Now Joseph was _well built and handsome_. ^[Literally "beautiful of form and beautiful of appearance"]

###### v7
And it happened _that_ after these things his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph, and she said, "Lie with me."

###### v8
But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Look, my master _does not worry about_ ^[Literally "does not know with me"] what _is_ in the house, and everything he owns he has put in my hand.

###### v9
He has no greater _authority_ in this house than me, and he has not withheld anything from me except you, since you _are_ his wife. Now how could I do this great wickedness and sin against God?"

###### v10
And it happened _that_ as she spoke to Joseph _day after day_, ^[Literally "day, day"] he did not heed her to lie beside her or to be with her.

###### v11
_But one particular day_ ^[Literally "and it happened as this day"] he came into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house were there in the house,

###### v12
she seized him by his garment _and_ said, "Lie with me!" And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and he went outside.

###### v13
And it happened _that_ when she saw that he left his garment in her hand and fled outside,

###### v14
she called to the men of her house and said to them, "Look! He ^[That is, Potiphar] brought a Hebrew man to us to mock us! He came to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.

###### v15
And when he heard _me_, that I raised my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me and fled, and he went outside."

###### v16
Then she put his garment beside her until his master came to his house.

###### v17
Then she spoke to him according to these words, saying, "The Hebrew slave that you brought to us came to me to make fun of me.

###### v18
And it happened _that_ as I raised my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me and fled outside."

###### v19
And when his master heard the words of his wife that she spoke to him, "_This is what your servant did to me_," ^[Literally "according to these words your servant did to me"] _he became very angry_. ^[Literally "his nostrils became hot"]

###### v20
And Joseph's master took him and put him into prison, the place that the king's prisoners were confined. And he was there in prison.

###### v21
And Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed loyal love to him, and gave him favor in the eyes of the chief of the prison.

###### v22
And the chief of the prison put all the prisoners that _were_ in the prison into the hand of Joseph. And everything that was done there, he _was_ the one who did _it_.

###### v23
The chief of the prison _did not worry about_ ^[Literally "did not pay heed to"] anything in his ^[That is, Joseph's] hand, since Yahweh _was_ with him. And whatever he did Yahweh made _it_ successful.
