###### v1
And it happened _that_ after these things the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and _his_ baker did wrong against their lord, against the king of Egypt.

###### v2
And Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, with the chief cupbearer and chief baker.

###### v3
And he put them in custody in the house of the chief of the guard, into the prison where Joseph was confined.

###### v4
And the chief of the guard appointed Joseph _to be_ with them, and he attended them. And they were in custody _many days_. ^[Literally "days"]

###### v5
And the two of them, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who _were_ confined in the prison, dreamed a dream, each his own dream, with its own interpretation.

###### v6
When Joseph came to them in the morning he looked at them, and behold, they were troubled.

###### v7
And he asked the court officials of Pharaoh that _were_ with him in the custody of his master's house, "Why _are_ your faces sad today?"

###### v8
And they said to him, "We _each_ dreamed a dream, but there is no one to interpret it." And Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell _them_ to me."

###### v9
Then the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and he said to him, "In my dream, now behold, _there was_ a vine before me,

###### v10
and on the vine _were_ three branches. And as it budded, its blossoms came up, _and_ its clusters of grapes grew ripe.

###### v11
And the cup of Pharaoh _was_ in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them into the cup of Pharaoh. Then I placed the cup into the hand of Pharaoh."

###### v12
Then Joseph said to him, "This _is_ its interpretation: The three branches, they _are_ three days.

###### v13
In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and will restore you to your office. And you shall put the cup of Pharaoh into his hand as _was_ formerly the custom, when you were his cupbearer.

###### v14
But remember me when it goes well with you, and please may you show kindness with respect to me, and mention me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.

###### v15
For I was surely kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me in this pit."

###### v16
And when the chief baker saw that the interpretation _was_ good he said to Joseph, "I also _dreamed_. In my dream, now behold, _there were_ three baskets of bread upon my head.

###### v17
And in the upper basket _were_ all sorts of baked foods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket upon my head."

###### v18
Then Joseph answered and said, "This _is_ its interpretation: The three baskets, they _are_ three days.

###### v19
In three days Pharaoh will lift your head from you and hang you on a pole, ^[Or "tree"] and the birds will eat your flesh from you."

###### v20
And it happened _that_ on the third day, _which was_ Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker in the midst of his servants.

###### v21
And he restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing _position_. And he placed the cup in the hand of Pharaoh.

###### v22
But the chief baker he hanged as Joseph had interpreted to them.

###### v23
But the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
