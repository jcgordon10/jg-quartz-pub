###### v1
And it happened _that_ after _two full years_ ^[Literally "two years of days"] Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he was standing by the Nile.

###### v2
And behold, seven cows, _well built and fat_, ^[Literally "beautiful of appearance and healthy of flesh"] were coming up from the Nile, and they grazed among the reeds.

###### v3
And behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, _ugly and gaunt_, ^[Literally "Poor of appearance and thin of flesh"] and they stood beside those ^[Or "the"] cows on the bank of the Nile.

###### v4
And the _ugly and gaunt_ ^[Literally "Poor of appearance and thin of flesh"] cows ate the seven _well built and fat_ ^[Literally "beautiful of appearance and healthy of flesh"] cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.

###### v5
And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time, and behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were coming out of one stalk.

###### v6
And behold, seven thin ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.

###### v7
And the thin ears of grain swallowed up the seven plump and full ears of grain. Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, _it was_ a dream.

###### v8
And it happened _that_ in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called all of the magicians ^[Or "soothsayer priests"] of Egypt, and all its wise men, and Pharaoh told his dream to them. But _they had no interpretation_ ^[Literally "there was no interpretation with them"] for Pharaoh.

###### v9
Then the chief of the cupbearers spoke with Pharaoh, saying, "I remember my sins today.

###### v10
Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the house of the chief of the guard.

###### v11
And we dreamed a dream one night, I and he, _each with a dream that had a meaning_. ^[Literally "each according to his dream we dreamed"]

###### v12
And there with us _was_ a young man, a Hebrew servant of the chief of the guard, and we told him _the dream_, and he interpreted our dreams for us, each according to his dream he interpreted.

###### v13
And it happened just as he interpreted to us, so it was. He ^[That is, Pharaoh] restored me to my office, and him ^[That is, the chief baker] he ^[That is, Pharaoh] hanged."

###### v14
Then Pharaoh sent and called _for_ Joseph, and they brought him quickly from the prison. And he shaved and changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.

###### v15
Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I dreamed a dream, but there is none to interpret it. Now, I have heard concerning you _that when_ you hear a dream _you can_ interpret it."

###### v16
Then Joseph answered Pharaoh saying, "_It is not in my power_; ^[Literally "besides me"] God will answer _concerning_ the well-being of Pharaoh."

###### v17
And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "_Now_ in my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile,

###### v18
and behold, seven cows, _well built and fat_, ^[Literally "beautiful of appearance and healthy of flesh"] were coming up from the Nile, and they grazed among the reeds.

###### v19
And behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, very _ugly and gaunt_ ^[Literally "Poor of appearance and thin of flesh"]--never have I seen _any_ as them in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.

###### v20
And the thin and ugly cows ate the former seven healthy cows.

###### v21
But _when_ they went into their bellies ^[Or "inner parts"] it could not be known that they went into their bellies, ^[Or "inner parts"] for their appearance _was_ as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke.

###### v22
Then I saw in my dream and behold, seven ears of grain were coming out of one stalk, full and good.

###### v23
And behold, seven withered ears of grain, thin _and_ scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.

###### v24
And the thin ears of grain swallowed up the seven good ears of grain. And I told the magicians, ^[Or "soothsayer priests"] but there was none to explain _it_ to me."

###### v25
Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh _are_ one. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.

###### v26
The seven good cows, they are seven years, and the seven good ears of grain, they _are_ seven years. The dreams _are_ one.

###### v27
And the seven thin and ugly cows coming up after them, they _are_ seven years, and the seven empty ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, they are _also_ seven years of famine.

###### v28
This _is_ the word that I have spoken to Pharaoh; God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.

###### v29
Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the whole land of Egypt.

###### v30
Then seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. The famine will consume the land.

###### v31
Abundance in the land will not be known because of the famine _that follows_, ^[Literally "that thus afterwards"] for it will be very heavy.

###### v32
Now concerning the repetition of the dream twice to Pharaoh, _it is_ because the matter _is_ established by God, and God will do _it_ quickly.

###### v33
Now then, let Pharaoh select a man _who is_ discerning and wise, and let him set him over the land of Egypt.

###### v34
Let Pharaoh do _this_, and let him appoint supervisors over the land, and let him take one-fifth from the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance.

###### v35
Then let them gather all the food of these coming good years and let them pile up grain under the hand of Pharaoh _for_ food in the cities, and let them keep _it_.

###### v36
Then the food shall be as a deposit for the land for the seven years of the famine that will be in the land of Egypt, that the land will not perish on account of the famine."

###### v37
And the plan ^[Or "word"] was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.

###### v38
Then Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this in whom is the spirit of God?"

###### v39
Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has made all of this known to you there is no one as discerning and wise as you.

###### v40
You shall be over my house, and to your word ^[Or "mouth"] all my people shall submit. Only _with respect to_ the throne will I be greater than you."

###### v41
Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."

###### v42
Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his finger and put it on the finger of Joseph. And he clothed him with garments of fine linen, and he put a chain of gold around his neck.

###### v43
And he had him ride in his second chariot. And they cried out before him, "Kneel!" And Pharaoh set him over all the land of Egypt.

###### v44
Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I _am_ Pharaoh, but without your consent no one will lift his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt."

###### v45
And Pharaoh called the name of Joseph Zaphenath-paneah and gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as a wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.

###### v46
Now Joseph _was thirty years old_ ^[Literally "a son of thirty years"] when he stood before Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and traveled through the whole land of Egypt.

###### v47
And the land produced a plenty in the seven years of abundance.

###### v48
And he gathered all the food of the seven years which _occurred_ in the land of Egypt. And he stored the food in the cities. The food of the field that surrounded _each_ city he stored in its midst.

###### v49
And Joseph piled up grain like the sand of the sea in great abundance until he stopped counting _it_, for _it could not be counted_. ^[Literally "there was no number"]

###### v50
Before the years of famine came, Asenath, daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore two sons to him.

###### v51
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, for _he said_, "God has caused me to forget all my hardship and all my father's house."

###### v52
And the name of the second he called Ephraim, for _he said_, "God has made me fruitful in the land of my misfortune."

###### v53
And the seven years of abundance which _were_ in the land of Egypt came to an end.

###### v54
And the seven years of famine began to come as Joseph had said. And there was famine in all of the countries, but in the land of Egypt there was food.

###### v55
And when all the land of Egypt was hungry the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. And Pharaoh said to all the land of Egypt, "Go to Joseph; what he says to you, you must do."

###### v56
And the famine was over the whole land, and Joseph opened all the storehouses ^[Hebrew "that which was in them"] and sold _food_ to the Egyptians. And the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.

###### v57
And every land came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, for the famine was severe in every land.
