###### v1
When Jacob realized that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?"

###### v2
Then he said, "Look, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy grain for us there that we may live and not die."

###### v3
And the ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain from Egypt.

###### v4
But Jacob did not send Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, for _he feared harm would come to him_. ^[Literally "he thought, lest harm encounter him"]

###### v5
Then the sons of Israel went to buy grain amid those _other people_ who went _as well_, for there was famine in the land of Canaan.

###### v6
Now Joseph was the governor over the land. He _was_ the one who sold _food_ to all the people of the land. And the brothers of Joseph came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.

###### v7
And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger to them. And he spoke with them harshly and said to them, "From where have you come?" And they said, "From the land of Canaan to buy food."

###### v8
And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.

###### v9
And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed concerning them, and he said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!"

###### v10
And they said to him, "No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.

###### v11
We all are sons of one man. We _are_ honest _men_. We, your servants, are not spies."

###### v12
Then he said to them, "No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land."

###### v13
Then they said, "We, your servants, _are_ twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, but behold, the youngest _is_ with our father today, and one is no more."

###### v14
But Joseph said to them, "It _is_ what I said to you--you _are_ spies.

###### v15
By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh you will not go out from here unless your youngest brother comes here.

###### v16
Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, but you will be kept in prison so that your words might be tested _to see_ if _there is_ truth with you. And if not, by the life of Pharaoh surely you _are_ spies."

###### v17
Then he gathered them into the prison for three days.

###### v18
On the third day Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live; I fear God.

###### v19
If you _are_ honest, let one of your brothers be kept in prison _where you are now being kept_, ^[Literally "in the house of your custody"] but _the rest of_ you go, carry grain for the famine for your households.

###### v20
You must bring your youngest brother to me, and then your words will be confirmed and you will not die." And they did so.

###### v21
Then each said to his brother, "Surely we _are_ guilty on account of our brother when we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded for mercy to us and we would not listen. Therefore this trouble has come to us."

###### v22
Then Reuben answered them, saying, "Did I not say to you, do not sin against the boy? But you did not listen, and now, behold, his blood has been sought."

###### v23
Now they did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter _was_ between them.

###### v24
And he turned away from them and wept. Then he returned to them and spoke to them, and took Simeon from them and tied him up in front of them.

###### v25
Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to return their money to each sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. Thus he did for them.

###### v26
Then they loaded their grain upon their donkeys and went _away_ from there.

###### v27
And one _of them later_ opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place and saw his money--behold, it _was_ in the mouth of his sack.

###### v28
And he said to his brothers, "My money was returned and moreover, behold, _it is_ in my sack!" Then _their hearts failed them_ ^[Literally "their heart went out"] and each of them trembled _and_ said, "What _is_ this God has done to us?"

###### v29
And when they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan they told him everything _that_ had happened to them, saying,

###### v30
"The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and treated us as _if we were_ spying out the land.

###### v31
But we said to him, 'We _are_ honest; we are not spies.

###### v32
We _are_ twelve brothers, the sons of our father. One is no more and the youngest _is_ with our father now in the land of Canaan.'

###### v33
Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know that you _are_ honest. Leave one _brother_ with me, and take _food for_ the famine in your households and go.

###### v34
And bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you _are_ not spies but you _are_ honest. And I will give your brother _back_ to you, and you will trade in the land.'"

###### v35
And it happened _that when_ they emptied their sacks, behold, each one's pouch of money _was_ in his sack. And when they and their father saw the pouches of their money, they were greatly distressed.

###### v36
And Jacob their father said to them, "You have bereaved me--Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and Benjamin you would take! All of this _is_ against me!

###### v37
Then Reuben said to his father, "You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hand and I myself will return him to you."

###### v38
But he said, "My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone remains. _If_ harm meets him on the journey that you would take, you would bring down my gray head in sorrow to Sheol."
