###### v1
Now the famine in the land _was_ severe.

###### v2
And it happened _that_ as they finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt their father said to them, "Return and buy a little food for us."

###### v3
Then Judah said to him, "The man solemnly admonished us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother _is_ with you.'

###### v4
_If you will send_ ^[Literally "if there is a sending"] our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you,

###### v5
but _if you will not send_ ^[Literally "if there is no sending"] _him_, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother _is_ with you.'"

###### v6
Then Israel said, "Why did you bring trouble to me by telling the man you still had a brother?"

###### v7
And they said, "The man asked explicitly about us and about our family, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have a brother?' And we answered him according to these words. How could we know that he would say, 'Bring down your brother'?"

###### v8
Then Judah said to his father Israel, "Send the boy with me, and let us arise and go, so that we will live and not die--you, we, and our children.

###### v9
I myself will be surety for him. You may seek him from my hand. If I do not bring him back to you and present him before you, then I will stand guilty before you forever.

###### v10
Surely if we had not hesitated by this _time_ we would have returned twice."

###### v11
Then their father Israel said to them, "If _it must be_ so then do this. Take some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift--a little balm and honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, and pistachios and almonds.

###### v12
And take double _the_ money in your hands. Take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it _was_ a mistake.

###### v13
And take your brother. Now arise and return to the man.

###### v14
And may El-Shaddai ^[Often translated "God Almighty"] grant you compassion before the man that he may release your other brother to you and Benjamin. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved."

###### v15
So the men took this gift, and they took double money in their hands, and Benjamin, and they rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.

###### v16
When Joseph saw Benjamin with them he said to the one who _was_ over his household, "Bring the men into the house and slaughter and prepare _an animal_, for the men shall eat with me at noon."

###### v17
And the man did as Joseph had said, and the man brought the men into the house of Joseph.

###### v18
And the men were afraid when they were brought into the house of Joseph. And they said "We were brought _here_ on account of the money that was returned to our sacks the first time, that he might attack us and fall upon us to take us as slaves with our donkeys."

###### v19
So they approached the man who _was_ over Joseph's house and spoke to him at the doorway of the house.

###### v20
And they said, "Please, my lord, we surely came down once before to buy food,

###### v21
but when we came to the place of lodging and we opened our sacks, then behold, each one's money _was_ in the mouth of his sack--our money in its _full_ weight--so we have returned _with_ it in our hands.

###### v22
Now, other money we have brought down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks."

###### v23
And he said, "Peace to you; do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father must have given you a treasure in your sacks; your money came to me." And he brought Simeon out to them.

###### v24
Then the man brought the men into Joseph's house and he gave them water and washed their feet, and gave fodder to their donkeys.

###### v25
Then they laid out ^[Or "prepared"] the gift until Joseph came at noon, for they had heard that they were to eat food there.

###### v26
And when Joseph came into the house they brought the gift that _was_ in their hand into the house to him, and they bowed down before him to the ground.

###### v27
And _he greeted them_ ^[Literally "he asked peace for them"] and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"

###### v28
And they said, "Your servant our father _is_ well; he is still alive." And they knelt and bowed down.

###### v29
Then he lifted up his eyes and saw Benjamin his brother, the son of his mother, and said, "Is this your youngest brother of whom you told me?" And he continued, ^[Or "said"] "God be gracious to you, my son."

###### v30
Then Joseph _hurried away_, ^[Literally "made haste"] _being overcome with emotion_ ^[Literally "his compassion boiled up"] toward his brother, and sought for _a place_ to cry. Then he went into a room and wept there.

###### v31
Then he washed his face and went out, now controlling himself, and said, "Serve the food."

###### v32
And they served him ^[That is, Joseph] by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves, for Egyptians _could not dine_ ^[Literally "were not able to eat food"] with Hebrews, because that _was_ a detestable thing to Egyptians.

###### v33
And they were seated before him _from_ the firstborn according to his birthright _to_ the youngest according to his youth. And the men _looked at one another_ ^[Literally "each to his companion"] amazed.

###### v34
And portions were served to them from _his table_, ^[Literally "his presence"] and the portion of Benjamin was five times greater than the portion of any of them. And they drank and became drunk with him.
