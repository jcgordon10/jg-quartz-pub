###### v1
Then he commanded _the one_ who _was_ over his household, saying, "Fill the sacks of the men _with_ food as much as they are able to carry, and put each one's money in the mouth of his sack.

###### v2
And my cup--the cup of silver--you shall put into the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and the money for his grain. And he did according to the word of Joseph that he had commanded.

###### v3
_When_ the morning light _came_ the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.

###### v4
They went out of the city, _and_ had not gone far when Joseph said to _the one_ who _was_ over his house, "Arise! Pursue after the men and overtake them. Then you shall say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good?

###### v5
Is this not that from which my master drinks? Now he himself certainly practices divination with it. You have done evil _in_ what you have done.'"

###### v6
When he overtook them he spoke these words to them.

###### v7
And they said to him, "Why has my lord spoken according to these words? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!

###### v8
Behold, the money that we found in the mouth of our sacks we returned to you from the land of Canaan. Now why would we steal silver or gold from the house of my lord?

###### v9
Whoever is found with it from among your servants shall die. And moreover, we will become slaves to my lord."

###### v10
Then he said, "Now also according to your words, thus will it be. He who is found with it shall be my slave, but you shall be innocent."

###### v11
Then each man quickly brought down his sack to the ground, and each one opened his sack.

###### v12
And he searched, beginning with the oldest and finishing with the youngest. And the cup was found in the sack of Benjamin.

###### v13
Then they tore their clothes, and each one loaded his donkey and they returned to the city.

###### v14
And Judah and his brothers came to the house of Joseph--now he _was_ still there--they fell before him to the ground.

###### v15
Then Joseph said to them, "What is this deed that you have done? Did you not know that a man who _is_ like me surely practices divination?"

###### v16
And Judah said, "What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? Now how can we show ourselves innocent? God has found the guilt of your servants! Behold, we _are_ slaves to my lord, both we and also he in whose hand the cup was found."

###### v17
But he said, "Far be it from me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found, he will become my slave. But as for you, go up in peace to your father."

###### v18
But Judah drew near to him and said, "Please my lord, let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord, and _let not your anger burn_ ^[Literally "let not your nose become hot"] against your servant, for _you are like Pharaoh himself_. ^[Literally "like you like Pharaoh"]

###### v19
My lord had asked his servants, saying, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'

###### v20
And we said to my lord, 'We have an aged father, and a younger _brother_, the child of his old age, and his brother died, and he alone remains from his mother, and his father loves him.'

###### v21
Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me that I may set my eyes upon him.'

###### v22
Then we said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father; if he should leave his father, then he ^[That is, the father (Jacob/Israel)] would die.'

###### v23
Then you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not again see my face.'

###### v24
And it happened _that_ we went up to your servant, my father, and told him the words of my lord.

###### v25
And when our father said, 'Buy a little food for us,'

###### v26
then we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother _is_ with us, then we shall go down. For we will not be able to see the face of the man unless our youngest brother _is_ with us.'

###### v27
Then your servant, my father, said to us, 'You yourselves know that my wife bore two sons to me.

###### v28
One went out from me, and I said, "Surely he must have been torn to pieces," and I have never seen him since.

###### v29
And if you take this one also from me, and he encounters harm, you will bring down my gray head in sorrow to Sheol.'

###### v30
So now, when I come to your servant, my father, and the boy is not with us--now his life is bound up with his life--

###### v31
it shall happen _that_ when he sees that the boy is gone, he will die. And your servants will bring down the gray head of your servant, our father, to Sheol with sorrow.

###### v32
For your servant is pledged as surety for the boy by my father, saying, If I do not bring him to you, then I shall be culpable to my father forever.

###### v33
So then, please let your servant remain in place of the boy as a slave to my lord, and let the boy go up with his brothers.

###### v34
For how can I go up to my father if the boy is not with me? _I do not want to see_ ^[Literally "lest I see"] the misery which will find my father."
