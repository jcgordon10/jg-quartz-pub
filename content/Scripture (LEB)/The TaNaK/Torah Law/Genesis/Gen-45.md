###### v1
Then Joseph was not able to control himself before all who were standing by him. And he cried out, "Make every man go out from me!" So no one stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.

###### v2
And _he wept loudly_, ^[Literally "he gave his voice with weeping"] so that the Egyptians heard _it_ and the household of Pharaoh heard _it_.

###### v3
Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I _am_ Joseph! Is my father still alive?" And his brothers were unable to answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.

###### v4
So Joseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, please." And they drew near. And he said, "I _am_ Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.

###### v5
So now, do not be distressed and do not be angry _with yourselves_ ^[Literally "in your eyes"] that you sold me here, for God sent me as deliverance before you.

###### v6
For these two years the famine _has been_ in the midst of the land, but _there will be_ five more years where there is no plowing or harvest.

###### v7
And God sent me before you _all_ to preserve for you a remnant in the land and to keep alive among you many survivors.

###### v8
So now, you yourselves did not send me here, but God put me here as father to Pharaoh and as master of all his household, and a ruler over all the land of Egypt.

###### v9
Hurry, and go up to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me and do not delay.

###### v10
You shall settle in the land of Goshen so that you will be near me, you and your children and your grandchildren, and your flocks and your herds and all that you have.

###### v11
And I will provide for you there, because _there are_ still five years of famine--lest you and your household and all that you have become destitute.'

###### v12
Now behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that _it is I_ ^[Literally "it is my mouth"] who am speaking to you.

###### v13
And you must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt and all that you have seen. Now hurry and bring my father here."

###### v14
Then he fell upon the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.

###### v15
And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. And afterward his brothers spoke with him.

###### v16
Then the report was heard _in_ the house of Pharaoh, saying, "Joseph's brothers have come." And it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.

###### v17
Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers: 'Do this--load your donkeys and go back to the land of Canaan,

###### v18
and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.'

###### v19
And you _Joseph_, are commanded _to say_ this: 'Do this! Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives, and bring your father and come!

###### v20
_Do not worry_ ^[Literally "let not your eyes be troubled"] about your possessions, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'"

###### v21
And the sons of Israel did so. And Joseph gave them wagons at the word of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.

###### v22
To each and to all of them he gave sets of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of clothing.

###### v23
And to his father he sent _as follows_: ^[Literally "according to this"] ten donkeys carrying the best of Egypt, and ten donkeys carrying grain and food and provisions for his father for the journey.

###### v24
Then he sent his brothers away, and when they departed he said to them, "Do not be agitated on the journey."

###### v25
So they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.

###### v26
And they spoke to him, saying, "Joseph _is_ still alive, and he _is_ ruler over all the land of Egypt." And his heart _went numb_, ^[Or "became cold"] because he did not believe him.

###### v27
Then they told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them. And when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, then the spirit of Jacob their father revived.

###### v28
And Israel said, "_It is_ enough. Joseph my son _is_ still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
