###### v1
"'When a person ^[Or "a soul"] brings a grain offering to Yahweh, his offering must be finely milled flour, and he must pour out oil on it and place frankincense on it.

###### v2
And he shall bring it to the sons of Aaron, the priests, and he ^[That is, the priest--see v. [[Lev-02#v9|9]]] shall take _his handful from its finely milled flour_ ^[Literally "from there his handful from its finely milled flour"] and from its oil in addition to all its frankincense. The priest ^[Or "And the priest"] shall turn its token portion into smoke on the altar _as_ an offering made _by_ fire, _as_ an appeasing fragrance for Yahweh.

###### v3
The remainder ^[Or "And the remainder"] of the grain _offering_ _belongs to_ ^[Literally "for"] Aaron and to his sons--_it is a most holy thing_ ^[Literally "a holiness of holinesses"] from the offerings made by fire for ^[Hebrew "of"] Yahweh.

###### v4
"'But if you bring a grain offering of something oven-baked, _it must be of_ finely milled flour _as_ ring-shaped unleavened bread _mixed_ with oil or wafers of unleavened bread smeared with oil.

###### v5
If your offering _is_ a _grain_ offering _baked_ on a ^[Hebrew "the"] flat baking pan, it must be finely milled flour, unleavened bread mixed with oil;

###### v6
break it into pieces and pour out oil on it; it _is_ a grain _offering_.

###### v7
"'If ^[Or "And if"] your offering _is_ a grain _offering_ _prepared in_ a cooking pan, it must be _with_ finely milled flour in oil.

###### v8
And you shall bring the grain _offering_ that is made from these things to Yahweh, and _the offerer_ ^[Changing from 2ms in the first verb to 3ms in the second verb apparently moves from general to specific; NET takes the second verb as an imperative ("Present it"), and NJPS translates it as an indefinite 3ms, making it passive ("it shall be brought")] shall bring it to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar.

###### v9
And the priest shall take away from the grain _offering_ its token portion, and he shall turn _it_ into smoke on the altar _as_ an offering made _by_ fire, _as_ an appeasing fragrance for Yahweh.

###### v10
And the remainder of the grain _offering_ _belongs to_ ^[Literally "for"] Aaron and to his sons--_it is a most holy thing_ ^[Literally "a holiness of holinesses"] from the offerings made by fire for ^[Hebrew "of"] Yahweh.

###### v11
"'Every grain _offering_ you ^[The first time a plural 2m verb has been employed since 1:2] bring to Yahweh must not be made of yeasted food, because you must not turn into smoke any yeast or any honey from ^[Hebrew "from it"] an offering made by fire for Yahweh.

###### v12
_As_ an offering of _the_ choicest portion, you ^[Another occurrence of the 2mp] may bring them to Yahweh, but they must not be offered on the altar _as_ an appeasing fragrance.

###### v13
Also all ^[Or "And all"] of your grain offerings you must season with salt; you ^[Or "and you"] must not omit the salt of your God's covenant from your offering.

###### v14
"'And if you bring to Yahweh a grain _offering_ of firstfruits, you must bring an ear of new grain roasted by fire, coarsely crushed ripe grain, _as_ the grain _offering_ of your firstfruits.

###### v15
And you shall put oil on it and place frankincense on it; it _is_ a grain _offering_.

###### v16
The ^[Or "And the"] priest shall turn into smoke its token portion from its coarsely crushed grain together with all of its frankincense--_it is_ an offering made by fire for Yahweh.'"
