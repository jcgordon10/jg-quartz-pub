###### v3
and summon all of the community to the entrance to ^[Or "of"] the tent of assembly."

###### v4
So ^[Or "And"] Moses did _just_ as Yahweh commanded him, and the community gathered by the entrance to ^[Or "of"] the tent of assembly.

###### v5
Then ^[Or "And"] Moses said to the community, "This _is_ the word that Yahweh has commanded to be done." ^[Or "to do" or "_me_ to do"]

So ^[Or "And"] Moses brought Aaron and his sons near, and he washed them with water.

###### v7
Then ^[Or "And"] he put the tunic on him and tied ^[Or "he tied"] the sash _around_ him; then ^[Or "and"] he clothed him with the robe and put ^[Or "he put"] the ephod on him; then ^[Or "and"] he tied the ephod's waistband _around_ him and fastened ^[Or "he fastened"] _the ephod_ ^[Understood by context] to him with it.

###### v8
Then ^[Or "And"] he placed the breastpiece on him and put ^[Or "he put"] the Urim and the Thummim into the breastpiece;

and he placed the turban on his head, and on _the front of_ ^[Literally "to the front of his faces"] the turban he placed the gold rosette, the holy diadem, _just_ as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

Then ^[Or "And"] Moses took the anointing oil and anointed ^[Or "he anointed"] the tabernacle and all that _was_ in it, and he consecrated them.

And he spattered _part of_ ^[Literally "from"] it on the altar seven times--thus ^[Or "and"] he anointed the altar and all of its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.

###### v12
Then ^[Or "And"] he poured out _part of_ ^[Literally "from"] the anointing oil on Aaron's head--thus ^[Or "and"] he anointed him _in order_ to consecrate him.

###### v13
Then ^[Or "And"] Moses brought Aaron's sons near and clothed ^[Or "he clothed"] them _with_ tunics and tied ^[Or "he tied"] a sash _around_ _each one_, ^[Literally "them"] and he bound headbands on ^[Or "to"] them, _just_ as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

###### v14
Then ^[Or "And"] he brought forth the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering,

###### v15
and he slaughtered _it_, and Moses took the blood and put ^[Or "he put"] _it_ with his finger on the altar's horns all around and purified the altar; then ^[Or "and"] he poured the blood out on the altar's base--thus ^[Or "and"] he consecrated it _in order_ to make atonement for it. ^[Or "to make atonement upon it" (see NET, Tanakh)]

###### v16
Then ^[Or "And"] he took all the fat that _was_ on the inner parts ^[Or "entrails"] and the lobe on the liver and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses turned _them_ into smoke on the altar,

###### v17
but ^[Or "and"] he burned the bull and its skin and its meat and its offal in the fire _outside the camp_, ^[Literally "from an outside place of the camp"] _just_ as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

###### v18
Then ^[Or "And"] he brought the ram of the burnt offering near, and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the ram's head,

###### v19
and he slaughtered _it_. Then ^[Or "And"] Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar all around.

###### v20
Then ^[Or "And"] he cut the ram into pieces, and Moses turned into smoke the head and the pieces and the suet,

###### v21
but ^[Or "and"] he washed the inner parts ^[Or "entrails"] and the lower leg bones with water, and Moses turned into smoke all of the ram on the altar; it _was_ a burnt offering as an appeasing fragrance, an offering made by fire for ^[Or "to"] Yahweh, _just_ as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

###### v22
Then ^[Or "And"] he brought the second ram near, the ram of the consecration, and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the ram's head,

and he slaughtered _it_. Then ^[Or "And"] Moses took _some of_ ^[Literally "from"] its blood and put ^[Or "he put"] _it_ on Aaron's right ear lobe and on his right hand's thumb and on his right foot's big toe.

###### v24
Then ^[Or "And"] he brought Aaron's sons near, and Moses put _some of_ ^[Literally "from"] the blood on their right ear lobe and on their right hand's thumb and on their right foot's big toe, and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar all around.

###### v25
Then ^[Or "And"] he took the fat and the fat tail and all of the fat that _was_ on the inner parts ^[Or "entrails"] and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right upper thigh;

###### v26
and from the basket of the unleavened bread that _was_ before Yahweh he took one ring-shaped unleavened bread and one ring-shaped bread with ^[Or "of"] oil and one wafer, and he placed _them_ on the _fat parts_ ^[Literally "fats"] and on the right upper thigh.

###### v27
Then ^[Or "And"] he put _all of these_ ^[Literally "the all"] on Aaron's palms and on his sons' palms, and he waved them _as_ a wave offering _before_ ^[Literally "to the faces of"] Yahweh.

###### v28
Then ^[Or "And"] Moses took them from upon their palms, and he turned _them_ into smoke upon the burnt offering on the altar; they _were_ a consecration offering as an appeasing fragrance--it _was_ an offering made by fire for ^[Or "to"] Yahweh.

###### v29
Then ^[Or "And"] Moses took the breast section, and he waved it _as_ a wave offering _before_ ^[Literally "to the faces of"] Yahweh from the ram of the consecration offering; it _was_ Moses' share, _just_ as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

###### v30
Then ^[Or "And"] Moses took _some of_ ^[Literally "from"] the anointing oil and _some of_ ^[Literally "from"] the blood that _was_ on the altar, and he spattered _them_ on Aaron, on his garments, and on Aaron's sons and on his sons' garments with him--thus ^[Or "and"] he consecrated Aaron, his garments, and his sons and his sons' garments with him.

###### v31
Then ^[Or "And"] Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, "Boil the meat in _the_ entrance to ^[Or "of"] _the_ tent of assembly, and there you must eat it and the bread that _is_ in the basket of the consecration offering, _just_ as I have commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons must eat it,'

###### v32
but ^[Or "and"] the remainder of the meat and the bread you ^[Plural] must burn in the fire.

###### v33
And you must not go out from the entrance to ^[Or "of"] _the_ tent of assembly _for_ seven days, until _the_ day of fulfilling the days of your ^[Plural] consecration, because _it will take seven days to ordain you_. ^[Literally "seven of days it will fill your (plural) hand"]

###### v34
_Just_ as was done ^[Or "he did"] on this day, Yahweh commanded to be done ^[Or "to do"] _in order_ to make atonement for you. ^[Plural]

###### v35
And you ^[Plural] must stay _at the_ entrance to ^[Or "of"] _the_ tent of assembly day and night _for_ seven days, and you ^[Plural] shall keep the obligation from ^[Or "of"] Yahweh, so you ^[Plural] might not die, for thus I have been commanded."

###### v36
So ^[Or "And"] Aaron and his sons did all the things that Yahweh had commanded _through_ ^[Literally "by the hand of"] Moses.
