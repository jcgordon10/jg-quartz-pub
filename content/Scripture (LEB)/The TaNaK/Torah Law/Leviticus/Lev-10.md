###### v1
And Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu each took his censer, and they put fire in them and placed incense on it; ^[That is, the fire] then ^[Or "and"] they presented _before_ ^[Literally "to the faces of"] Yahweh illegitimate fire, which he had not commanded them.

###### v2
So ^[Or "And"] fire went out _from before_ ^[Literally "from to the faces of"] Yahweh, and it consumed them so that ^[Or "and"] they died _before_ ^[Literally "to the faces of"] Yahweh.

###### v3
Therefore ^[Or "And"] Moses said to Aaron, "This _is_ what Yahweh spoke, saying, 'Among those who are close to me I will show myself holy, and _in the presence of_ ^[Literally "upon the faces of"] all the people I will display my glory.'" ^[Or "I will be glorified"] So ^[Or "And"] Aaron was silent.

###### v4
Then ^[Or "And"] Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and he said to them, "Come forward. ^[Or "Come near" or "Approach"] Carry your brothers from _the front of_ ^[Literally "the faces of"] the sanctuary to _outside the camp_." ^[Literally "from an outside place of the camp"]

###### v5
So ^[Or "And"] they came forward, ^[Or "came near" or "approached"] and they carried them _outside the camp_ ^[Literally "to from an outside place of the camp"] in their tunics, just as Moses had ordered.

###### v6
Then ^[Or "And"] Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "You must not let your hair hang loosely, and you must not tear your garments, so that ^[Or "and"] you will not die and he ^[That is, God] will be angry with all the community. But ^[Or "And"] your brothers, all the house of Israel, may weep _because of_ _the burning that Yahweh caused_, ^[Literally "the burning that Yahweh burned"]

###### v7
but ^[Or "and"] you must not go out from _the_ entrance to ^[Or "of"] _the_ tent of assembly lest you die, because Yahweh's anointing oil _is_ on you." So ^[Or "And"] they did according to Moses' word.

###### v8
Then ^[Or "And"] Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying,

###### v9
"You and your sons with you may not drink wine or ^[Or "and"] strong drink when you come to _the_ tent of assembly, so that ^[Or "and"] you will not die--_it is_ a lasting statute for your ^[Plural] generations--

###### v10
and to distinguish between the holy and the unholy, ^[Or "the common"] as well as ^[Or "and"] between the unclean and the clean,

###### v11
and to teach the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] all the rules that Yahweh has spoken to them _through_ ^[Literally "by the hand of"] Moses."

###### v12
Then ^[Or "And"] Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "_As for_ the remaining _parts_, ^[Implied by plural form of noun and the immediate context] take the remainder _of_ the grain offering from Yahweh's offerings made by fire and eat it, _the_ unleavened bread, beside the altar, because it _is_ _a most holy thing_. ^[Literally "a holiness of holinesses"]

###### v13
And you shall eat it in a holy place, because it _is_ your allotted portion and the allotted portion of your sons from Yahweh's offerings made by fire, for so I have been commanded.

###### v14
And the wave offering's breast section and the upper thigh of the contribution _offering_ you ^[Plural] must eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, because they are given _as_ your allotted portion and your sons' allotted portion from the sacrifices of the _Israelites_' ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] fellowship offerings.

###### v15
They must bring the thigh of the contribution _offering_ and the breast section of the wave offering in addition to the offerings made by fire, _consisting_ of the fat portions, to wave as a wave offering _before_ ^[Literally "to the faces of"] Yahweh; and it will be for you and for your sons with you as a lasting rule, _just_ as Yahweh had commanded."

###### v16
Then ^[Or "And"] Moses sought all over _for_ the goat of the sin offering and behold, it was burned up. So ^[Or "And"] he was angry with Aaron's remaining sons Eleazar and Ithamar, saying,

###### v17
"Why did you not eat the sin offering on the sanctuary's site, because it _is_ _a most holy thing_? ^[Literally "a holiness of holinesses"] And he gave it to you to remove the community's guilt, to make atonement for them _before_ ^[Literally "to the faces of"] Yahweh.

###### v18
Look, its blood was not brought _inside the sanctuary_. ^[Or "to the sanctuary inside" or "to the sanctuary within"] Certainly you should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded."

###### v19
So ^[Or "And"] Aaron said to Moses, "Look, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering _before_ ^[Literally "to the faces of"] Yahweh, and _things_ such as these have happened to me, and _if_ I were to eat a sin offering today, would it have been good in Yahweh's eyes?"

###### v20
When ^[Or "And"] Moses heard, it ^[Or "and it"] was good in his eyes.
