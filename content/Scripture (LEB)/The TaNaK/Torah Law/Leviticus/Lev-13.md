###### v3
And the priest shall examine the infection on his body's skin, and _if_ _the_ hair in the infection turns white and the appearance of the infection _is_ deeper than his body's skin, it _is_ an infectious skin disease, and the priest shall examine it, and he shall declare him unclean.

###### v4

the priest shall examine _it_, ^[The direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and _if_ ^[Literally "look" or "behold"] a white swelling _is_ on the skin and it turns _the_ hair white and _raw flesh_ ^[Literally "living of living flesh"] _is_ in the swelling,

###### v11
it _is_ a chronic infectious skin disease on his body's skin, and the priest shall declare him unclean; he shall not confine him, because he _is_ unclean.

###### v13
then ^[Or "and"] the priest shall examine _it_, ^[The direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and _if_ ^[Literally "look" or "behold"] the infectious skin disease covers his whole body, then ^[Or "and"] he shall pronounce the afflicted person clean--all of it has turned white; he is clean.

###### v29
"And when a man or a woman _has_ ^[Literally "becomes on him"] an infection on _the_ head or in _the_ beard,

###### v30
then ^[Or "and"] the priest shall examine the infection, and _if_ ^[Literally "look" or "behold"] its appearance _is_ deeper than the skin and in it _is_ thin bright red hair, then ^[Or "and"] the priest shall declare it unclean--it _is_ a diseased area of skin; it _is_ an infectious skin disease of the head or the beard.

then ^[Or "and"] the priest shall examine him, and _if_ ^[Literally "look" or "behold"] the diseased area of skin has spread on the skin, the priest shall not inspect _for_ bright ^[Hebrew "the bright"] red hair--he is unclean.

So ^[Or "And"] the priest shall examine him, and _if_ ^[Literally "look" or "behold"] the infection's swelling _is_ _pinkish_ ^[Literally "white red"] on his bald spot or on his bald forehead, like _the_ appearance of an infectious skin disease _on_ ^[Literally "of"] the body,

###### v44
he _is_ a man afflicted with a skin disease--he _is_ unclean; the priest certainly shall declare him unclean--his infection _is_ on his head.

###### v45
"As for ^[Or "And"] the person who is afflicted with a skin disease, his garments must be torn and his _hair_ ^[Literally "head"] must _be allowed to_ hang loosely, and he must cover _his_ upper lip, and he must call out, 'Unclean! Unclean!'

and _if_ the infection is yellowish green or reddish on the garment or on the leather or on the woven material or on the fabric or on any leather object, ^[Literally "an object of leather"] it _is_ an infectious skin disease ^[Perhaps better translated "mold" rather than "skin disease"] and it shall be shown _to_ the priest.

###### v50
And the priest shall examine the infection, and he shall confine the infected article _for_ seven days.

###### v51
And he shall examine the infection on the seventh day; if the infection has spread on the garment or on the woven material or on the fabric or on the leather, for any work for which the leather is used, the infection _is_ a destructive skin disease ^[Perhaps better translated "mold" rather than "skin disease"]--it _is_ unclean.

###### v52
And he shall burn the garment or the woven material or the fabric, _whether wool or linen_, ^[Literally "in/on the wool or in/on the linen"] or any leather object that _has_ ^[Literally "becomes on/in it"] the infection, because it _is_ an infectious skin disease, ^[Perhaps better translated "mold" rather than "skin disease"] _which is_ destructive--it must be burned in the fire.

###### v53
"But ^[Or "And"] if the priest examines _it_ ^[The direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and _if_ ^[Literally "look" or "behold"] the infection has not spread on the garment or on the woven material or on the fabric or on any leather object,

And the priest shall examine _it_ ^[The direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] after the infection has been washed off, and _if_ ^[Literally "look" or "behold"] the infection has not changed its outward appearance and the infection has not spread, it _is_ unclean; he must burn it in the fire; it _is_ a fungus on its back or on its front.

###### v56
But ^[Or "And"] if the priest examines _it_ ^[The direct object is supplied from context in the English translation] and _if_ ^[Literally "look" or "behold"] the infection _is_ faded after it has been washed off, then ^[Or "and"] he shall tear it from the garment or from the leather or from the woven material or from the fabric.

###### v57
And if it appears again on the garment or on the woven material or on the fabric or on any leather object, it _is_ spreading; you ^[Singular] must burn in the fire that which _has_ the infection in it.

###### v58
And the garment or the woven material or the fabric or any leather object that he might wash and the infection is removed from them then ^[Or "and"] shall be washed _a_ second _time_, and it shall be clean."

###### v59
This _is_ the regulation of the infectious skin disease ^[Perhaps better translated "mold" rather than "skin disease"] in ^[Hebrew "of"] the wool garment or the linen or the woven material or the fabric or any leather object to declare it clean or to declare it unclean.
