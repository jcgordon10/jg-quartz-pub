###### v1
Then ^[Or "And"] Yahweh said to Moses, "Speak to the priests, Aaron's sons, and say to them, 'One must not make himself unclean for a dead person among his _own_ people,

###### v2
except for his direct relative closest to him: his mother and his father, and his son and his daughter, and his brother,

###### v3
and for his sister, a virgin, _who is_ closest to him, _who has not had a husband_ ^[Literally "who is not for a man/husband"]--for her he may defile himself.

###### v4
He must not make himself unclean _as_ _a kinsman by marriage_, ^[Literally "a husband among his people"] defiling himself.

###### v5
"'And they shall not shave bald patches on their head, and they shall not shave off the corner of their beard, and they shall not make a cut in their body.

###### v6
They shall be holy to their God, and they shall not profane the name of their God, because they are bringing near the offerings made by fire to ^[Hebrew "of"] Yahweh--their God's food--and they shall be holy.

###### v7
"'They shall not _marry_ ^[Literally "take"] a woman _who is_ a prostitute and defiled, nor shall they _marry_ ^[Literally "take"] a woman divorced from her husband, because each priest ^[Hebrew "he"; singular antecedent specified from the context] _is_ holy for his God.

###### v8
And you shall consecrate him, because he is bringing near your God's food; he shall be holy to you, since I, Yahweh, who consecrates you, _am_ holy.

###### v9
"'As for ^[Or "And"] the daughter of any priest, if she is defiled by prostituting, she is disgracing her father--she shall be burned in the fire.

###### v10
"'As for ^[Or "And"] the priest _who is_ higher than his brothers, on whose head the oil of anointment is poured and _he was ordained_ ^[Literally "he has filled up his hand"] to wear the garments, he shall not dishevel his head, and he shall not tear his garments.

###### v11
And he shall not go near any dead person, nor shall he make himself unclean for his father or ^[Or "and"] for his mother.

###### v12
And he shall not go out from the sanctuary, and he shall not profane his God's sanctuary, because the dedication of his God's oil of anointment _is_ on him; I _am_ Yahweh.

###### v13
"'And he himself must take a wife in her virginity.

###### v14
A widow or ^[Or "and"] a divorced woman or ^[Or "and"] a defiled _woman_, a prostitute--these he must not take; he shall take only ^[Or "instead"] a virgin from his people _as_ wife.

###### v15
And he shall not profane his offspring among his people, because I _am_ Yahweh, who consecrates him.'"

###### v16
Then ^[Or "And"] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v17
"Speak to Aaron, saying, 'A man from your offspring throughout their generations, in whom is a physical defect, shall not come near to present your God's food.

###### v18
Indeed, ^[Or "For"] any man in whom is a physical defect shall not come near: a blind man or lame or disfigured or deformed,

###### v19
or a man in whom is a broken foot or a broken hand,

###### v20
or a hunchback or a dwarf, or a spot in his eye or a skin disorder or a skin eruption or a crushed testicle.

###### v21
Any man from Aaron the priest's offspring in whom is a physical defect shall not come near to present offerings made by fire to ^[Hebrew "of"] Yahweh; a physical defect _is_ in him; he shall not come near to present his God's food.

###### v22
He may eat his God's food, from _the most holy things_ ^[Literally "the holy things of the holy things"] and from the holy things.

###### v23
But he must not enter the curtain, and he must not come near to the altar, because a physical defect _is_ in him, and he must not profane my sanctuary, because I _am_ Yahweh, who consecrates them.'"

###### v24
Thus ^[Or "And"] Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]
