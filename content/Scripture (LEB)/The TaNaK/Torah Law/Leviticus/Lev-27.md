###### v5
And if from _five years of age_ ^[Literally "a son of five years"] up to ^[Or "and up to"] _twenty years of age_, ^[Literally "a son of twenty years"] then ^[Or "and"] your proper value shall be twenty shekels _for_ the male and ten shekels for the female.

###### v6
And if from _a month of age_ ^[Literally "a son of a month"] up to ^[Or "and up to"] _five years of age_, ^[Literally "a son of five years"] then ^[Or "and"] your proper value shall be five shekels _of_ money _for_ the male, and your proper value for the female _shall be_ three shekels _of_ money.

###### v8
But ^[Or "And"] if he _is_ poorer than your proper value, then ^[Or "and"] he shall present himself _before_ ^[Literally "to the faces of"] the priest, and the priest shall set a value _on_ him; the priest shall value him _according to_ ^[Literally "on a mouth of"] what the person who made a vow _can afford_. ^[Literally "his hand produces"]

###### v9
"'And if _it is_ a domestic animal from which they present an offering for Yahweh, all that he gives from it for Yahweh shall be a holy object.

###### v10
He shall not replace it, nor shall he exchange it, _either_ good with bad or bad with good; and if he indeed exchanges a domestic animal with a domestic animal, then ^[Or "and"] _it and its substitution shall be a holy object_. ^[Literally "it shall be and its substitution shall be holy"]

###### v11
But ^[Or "And"] if _it is_ any unclean animal from which they may not present an offering for Yahweh, then ^[Or "and"] he shall present the animal _before_ ^[Literally "to the faces of"] the priest.

###### v12
And the priest shall set a value on it, _either good or bad_; ^[Literally "between good and between bad"] as the priest _sets_ your proper value, so it shall be.

###### v13
And if he indeed wants to redeem it, then ^[Or "and"] he shall add a fifth of it onto your proper value.

###### v14
"'And if a man consecrates his house _as_ a holy object for Yahweh, then ^[Or "and"] the priest shall set a value on it, _either good or bad_; ^[Literally "between good and between bad"] _just_ as the priest sets a value on it, so it shall remain.

###### v15
But ^[Or "And"] if the one who consecrates _it_ wants to redeem his house, then ^[Or "and"] he shall add a fifth of your proper value's money onto it, and it shall be his.

###### v16
"'And if a man consecrates _some of_ ^[Literally "from"] his property's fields ^[Collective singular; Hebrew "field"] for Yahweh, then ^[Or "and"] your proper value shall be _in accordance with its seed requirements_: ^[Literally "to the number of its seed"] a homer of barley seed for fifty shekels of money.

###### v17
If he consecrates his field from the Year of Jubilee, it shall stand as your proper value.

###### v18
But ^[Or "And"] if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, then ^[Or "and"] the priest shall calculate the money for him _according to the number of years_ ^[Literally "on the mouth of the years"] that are left over until the Year of Jubilee; and it shall be deducted from your proper value.

###### v19
And if he indeed redeems the field that is consecrated, then ^[Or "and"] he shall add a fifth of your proper value's money onto it, and it shall stand for ^[Or "remain for" or "belong to"] him.

###### v20
And if he does not redeem the field and if he sells the field to another man, it may not be redeemed again,

###### v21
and the field shall be a holy object for Yahweh when it goes out ^[Or "is released" or "reverts"] in the Jubilee, like a devoted ^[Or "permanently set apart"; a different Hebrew word than previously translated "consecrated" in this chapter] field; _it shall be the priest's property_. ^[Literally "to/for the priest it shall be his property"]

###### v22
"'And if he consecrates for Yahweh his acquired ^[Or "purchased"] field that _is_ not the field of his _inherited_ possession,

###### v23
then ^[Or "and"] the priest shall calculate for him the _amount_ ^[Literally "number"] of your proper value until the year of the Jubilee, and he shall give your proper value on that day _as_ a holy object for Yahweh.

###### v24
In the Year of the Jubilee the field shall return to the one who bought it from him, to the one whose property the land _is_.

###### v25
And every proper value of yours shall be in the sanctuary's shekel--the shekel shall be twenty gerahs.

###### v26
"'However, a man shall not consecrate a firstborn among livestock, which belongs as firstborn to Yahweh; whether an ox _or_ ^[Literally "whether" or "if"] small livestock, it is for Yahweh.

###### v27
And if _it is_ among the unclean animals, then ^[Or "and"] he shall ransom _it_ according to your proper value, and he shall add a fifth of its _value_ onto it; and if it is not redeemed, then ^[Or "and"] it shall be sold according to your proper value.

###### v28
However, anything devoted ^[Or "permanently set apart"; a different Hebrew word than previously translated "consecrated" in this chapter] that a man has devoted to Yahweh _from all that he has_, ^[Literally "from all that _is_ for him"] from human or ^[Or "and"] animal, or ^[Or "and"] from the field of his property, may not be sold, and it may not be redeemed; anything devoted _is_ _a most holy thing_ ^[Literally "a holy thing of holy things"] for Yahweh.

###### v29
Anyone devoted who is devoted from _human beings_ ^[Literally "the human"] cannot be ransomed--he shall surely be put to death.

###### v30
"'And any tithe of the land from the land's seed _or_ from the fruit of the trees _is_ for Yahweh; it _is_ a holy object for Yahweh.

###### v31
And if a man indeed redeems from his tithe, he shall add a fifth of its _value_ onto it.

###### v32
As for ^[Or "And"] every tithe of cattle or ^[Or "and"] of the flock, ^[The Hebrew term refers collectively to both sheep and goats (small livestock animals)] all which crosses under the rod, the tenth shall be a holy object for Yahweh.

###### v33
He shall not inspect between _the_ good and _the_ bad, and he shall not exchange it; but ^[Or "and"] if he indeed exchanges it, then ^[Or "and"] _it and its substitution shall be_ ^[Literally "it shall be and its substitution shall be"] a holy object--it shall not be redeemed.'"

###### v34
These _are_ the commands that Yahweh commanded Moses for the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] on _Mount Sinai_. ^[Literally "the mountain of Sinai"]
