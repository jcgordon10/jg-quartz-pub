###### v1
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v2
"Command the _Israelites_: ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] they must send everyone from the camp who is afflicted with a rash, ^[The precise meaning is uncertain; many modern translations suggest "leprosy"] everyone with a fluid discharge, and everyone unclean through _contact with_ a corpse.

###### v3
You will send away _both male and female_; ^[Literally "from male until female"] you will send them _outside the camp_. ^[Literally "to an outside place of the camp"] They must not make unclean their camps where I _am_ dwelling in their midst."

###### v4
So the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did so. They sent them away _outside the camp_; ^[Literally "to an outside place of the camp"] just as Yahweh spoke to Moses, so did the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v5
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v6
"Speak to the _Israelites_: ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] 'When a man or woman _commits_ ^[Literally "does"] any of the sins of humankind by acting unfaithfully, _it is_ a sin against Yahweh, and that person will be guilty;

###### v7
they will confess their sin that they did and will make restitution _for_ their ^[Hebrew "his"] guilt by adding a fifth _to it_ ^[Literally "on top of it"] and giving _it_ _to whomever was wronged_. ^[Literally "to whomever he was guilty"]

###### v8
But if the man does not have a redeemer to make restitution to him for the reparation, the reparation is to be given to Yahweh for the priest, in addition to the ram of atonement by which atonement is made for him.

###### v9
And every contribution of all the holy objects of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] that they bring to the priest for him will be his.

###### v10
The holy objects of a man will be for him; ^[That is, the priest] whatever he gives to the priest will be for him.'"

###### v11
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v12
"Speak to the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and say to them, 'If any man's wife goes astray and acts unfaithfully to him,

###### v13
and a man sleeps with her and ejaculates and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and she is concealed, although she is defiled, and there is no witness against her and she was not caught,

###### v14
if a spirit of jealousy comes over him, and he is jealous _of_ his wife and she is defiled; or if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous _of_ his wife but she is not defiled,

###### v15
he will bring his wife to the priest. And he will bring her offering for her, one-tenth of an ephah of flour. He will not pour oil on it, and he will not put frankincense on it because _it is_ a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembering, ^[Or "memorial"] a reminding of guilt.

###### v16
"'Then the priest will bring her near and present her _before_ ^[Literally "before the face of"] Yahweh;

###### v17
the priest will take holy waters in a clay vessel, and from the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle, and the priest will put _it_ into the waters.

###### v18
And the priest will present the woman _before_ ^[Literally "before the face of"] Yahweh, and he will uncover the head of the woman; he will then put in her hands the grain offering of the remembering--_which is_ the grain offering of jealousy--and in the hand of the priest will be the waters of bitterness that brings a curse.

###### v19
Then the priest will make her swear an oath, and he will say to the woman, "If a man has not slept with you, and if you have not had an impurity affair under your husband, go unpunished from the waters of bitterness that brings this curse.

###### v20
But if you have had an affair under your husband, and if you are defiled and a man other than your husband had intercourse with you,"

###### v21
the priest will make the woman swear an oath of the sworn oath of the curse, the priest will say to the woman, "May Yahweh give you a curse and a sworn oath in the midst of your people with Yahweh making ^[Hebrew "giving"] your hip fall away ^[Or "waste away"] and your stomach swollen;

###### v22
and these waters that bring a curse will go into your intestines to cause _your_ womb to swell and to make _your_ hip fall away." ^[Or "waste away"] And the women will say, "Amen. Amen."

###### v23
"'And the priests will write these curses on the scroll, and he will wipe _them_ off into the waters of the bitterness.

###### v24
He will make the woman drink the waters of the bitterness that brings ^[Hebrew "bring"] a curse, and the waters of bitterness that bring a curse will go into her.

###### v25
The priest will take the grain offering of jealousy from the hand of the woman, and he will wave the grain offering _before Yahweh_, ^[Literally "before the face of Yahweh"] and he will present it to the altar;

###### v26
the priest will grasp her memorial offering from the grain offering, and he will turn _it_ into smoke _on_ the altar, and afterward he will make the woman drink the waters.

###### v27
When he has made her drink the waters, it will come about, if she has defiled herself and acted unfaithfully to her husband and the waters of bitterness that bring a curse go into her and her stomach swells and her hip falls away, ^[Or "wastes away"] the woman will be as a curse in the midst of her people.

###### v28
And if the woman is not defiled, and she _is_ pure, she will go unpunished and be able to conceive children.

###### v29
"'This _is_ the regulation of jealousy, when a woman has an affair under her husband and she is defiled,

###### v30
or when a spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous _of_ his wife, he will present the woman _before Yahweh_, ^[Literally "before the face of"]and the priest will do to her all of this law.

###### v31
The man will go unpunished from guilt, and the woman, she will bear her guilt.'"
