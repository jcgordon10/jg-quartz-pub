###### v1
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, in the second year after they came out from the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying,

###### v2
"Let the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] observe the Passover at its appointed time.

###### v3
On the fourteenth day of this month _at twilight_ ^[Literally "between the two evenings"] you will perform it at its appointed time according to all its decrees; and according to all its stipulations you will observe it."

###### v4
So Moses spoke to the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] to observe the Passover.

###### v5
And they observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month _at twilight_ ^[Literally "between the two evenings"] in the desert of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, thus the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] did.

###### v6
And it happened, men who were unclean _by a dead person_ ^[Literally "by a life of a person"] were not able to perform the Passover on that day. And they came _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Moses and Aaron on that day.

###### v7
And those men said to him, "_Although_ we _are_ unclean _by a dead person_, ^[Literally "by a life of a person"] why are we hindered from presenting the offering of Yahweh at its appointed time in the midst of the _Israelites_?" ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v8
Moses said to them, "Stay. I will hear what Yahweh commands to you."

###### v9
And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v10
"Speak to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] saying, 'Each man that is unclean _by a dead person_ ^[Literally "by a life of a person"] or _is_ on a far journey, you or your _descendants_, ^[Literally "generations"] he will observe the Passover of Yahweh.

###### v11
On the second month on the fourteenth day _at twilight_ ^[Literally "between the two evenings"] they will observe it; they will eat it with unleavened bread and bitter plants.

###### v12
They will leave none of it until morning, and they will not break a bone in it; they will observe it according to every decree of the Passover.

###### v13
But the man who _is_ clean and not on a journey, and he fails to observe the Passover, that person will be cut off from the people because he did not present the offering of Yahweh on its appointed time. That man will bear his guilt.

###### v14
If an alien dwells with you he will observe the Passover of Yahweh according _to_ the decree of the Passover and according _to_ its stipulation; thus you will have one decree for you, for the alien and for the native of the land.'"

###### v15
And on a day setting up the tabernacle, the cloud covered the tent of the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony; in the evening it was on the tabernacle as an appearance of fire until morning.

###### v16
So it was ^[Hebrew "it will be"] continually; the cloud would cover it and the appearance of fire _by_ night.

###### v17
_Whenever_ the cloud lifted up from on the tent, after that the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] would set out, and in the place where the cloud dwelled, there the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] camped.

###### v18
On the _command of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "mouth of Yahweh"] the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] would set out, and on the _command of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "mouth of Yahweh"] they encamped; all the days that the cloud dwelled on the tabernacle they encamped.

###### v19
And when the cloud prolonged on the tabernacle many days the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] kept the kept requirement of Yahweh and did not set out.

###### v20
When the cloud _remained_ ^[Literally "it was there"] a number of days on the tabernacle, on the _command of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "mouth of Yahweh"] they encamped; and on the _command of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "mouth of Yahweh"] they set out.

###### v21
When the cloud _remained_ ^[Literally "it was there"] from evening until morning, and the cloud lifted up in the morning, they would set out, or _if it remained_ in the daytime and _at_ night, _when_ the cloud lifted up they set out.

###### v22
When _it was_ two days, a month, _or a year_ ^[Literally "or days"] that the cloud prolonged to dwell on the tabernacle, the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] encamped, and they did not set out; when it lifted up they set out.

###### v23
On the _command of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "mouth of Yahweh"] they encamped, and on the _command of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "mouth of Yahweh"] they set out. They kept the requirement of Yahweh, on the _command of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "mouth of Yahweh"] in the hand of Moses. ^[Or "through Moses"]
