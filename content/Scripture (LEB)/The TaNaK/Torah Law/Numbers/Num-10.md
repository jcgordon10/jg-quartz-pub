The sons of Aaron, the priests, will blow on the trumpets; this will be an eternal decree for your generations.

###### v10
"And on the day of your joy and in your appointed times, at the beginning of your months, you will blow on the trumpets in addition to your burnt offerings and in addition to the sacrifices of your fellowship offerings.

Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses, "We _are_ setting out to the place that Yahweh said, 'I will give it to you'; go with us, and we will _treat you well_ ^[Literally "do good to you"] because _Yahweh promised_ ^[Literally "Yahweh spoke"] good concerning Israel."

###### v36
And when it rested he would say,
"Return, Yahweh,
to the countless thousands of Israel."
