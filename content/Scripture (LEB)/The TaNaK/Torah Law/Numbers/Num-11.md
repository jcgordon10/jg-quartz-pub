###### v1
And it happened, the people were like those who _complain of hardship_ ^[Literally "complain of bad"] _in the hearing_ ^[Literally "in the ears"] of Yahweh, and Yahweh _became angry_, ^[Literally "his nose became hot"] and the fire of Yahweh burned among them, and it consumed the edge of the camp.

###### v2
Then the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire died down.

###### v3
And he called the name of that place Taberah ^[This word is difficult, but some modern translations suggest the word in Hebrew means "burning" (see NRSV, NASB)] because the fire of Yahweh burned among them.

###### v4
The riff-raff that _were_ in their midst _had a strong desire_; ^[Literally "desired a desire"] and the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] turned back and also wept, and they said, "Who will feed us meat?

###### v5
We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumber, melon, leek, the onions, and the garlic.

###### v6
But now _our strength is dried up_; ^[Literally "our life _is_ dry"] there is nothing whatsoever except _for the manna before us_." ^[Literally "for the manna of our eyes"]

###### v7
Now the manna _was_ like coriander seed, and its outward appearance was like that of bdellium-gum.

###### v8
The people went about and gathered _it_, and they ground _it_ with mills or crushed _it_ with mortar. Then they boiled _it_ in a pot and made it _into_ bread-cakes; and it tasted like olive oil cakes.

###### v9
When the dew came down on the camp _at_ night, the manna came down _with_ it.

###### v10
Moses heard the people weeping according to their ^[Hebrew "its"] clans, each at the doorway of their tents. Then _Yahweh became very angry_, ^[Literally "the nose of Yahweh became very hot"] and in the eyes of Moses it was bad.

###### v11
And Moses said to Yahweh, "Why have you brought trouble to your servant? Why have I not found favor in your eyes, that the burdens of all these people have been placed on me?

###### v12
Did I conceive all these people? If I have fathered them, ^[Hebrew "him/it"] that you could say to me, 'Carry them ^[Hebrew "him/it"] in your lap, just as a foster-father carries the suckling on the land that you swore an oath to their ancestors?' ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v13
From where do I have meat to give all these people? They weep before me, saying, 'Give us meat and let us eat!'

###### v14
I am not able to carry all these people along alone; they are too heavy for me.

###### v15
If this is how you _are_ going to treat me, please kill me immediately if I find favor in your eyes, and do not let me see my misery."

###### v16
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Gather for me seventy men from the elders of Israel whom you know _are_ elders of the people and their ^[Hebrew "his/its"] officials; take them to the tent of assembly, and they will stand there with you.

###### v17
I will come down and speak with you there; I will take away from the spirit that _is_ on you, and I will place _it_ on them; and they will bear the burdens of the people with you; you will not bear it alone.

###### v18
And you will say to the people, 'Sanctify yourselves tomorrow, for you will eat meat because you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, "Who will feed us good meat? _It was_ good for us in Egypt." Yahweh will give to you meat, and you will eat.

###### v19
You will eat, not one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,

###### v20
_but for a whole month_, ^[Literally "until a period of one month"] until it comes out from your nose and becomes as nausea to you; because you have rejected Yahweh, who _is_ in your midst, and you wept before _his presence_, ^[Literally "before his face"] saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"

###### v21
But Moses said, "_There are_ six hundred thousand on foot, among whom I _am_ in the midst, and you yourself said, 'I will give meat to them, and they will eat for a whole month.'

###### v22
Should flocks and cattle be slaughtered for them? Should all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be enough for them?"

###### v23
And Yahweh said to Moses, "_Is Yahweh's power limited_? ^[Literally "Is Yahweh's hand short?"] Now you will see if my word will happen or not."

###### v24
So Moses went out, and he spoke the words of Yahweh to the people, and he gathered _together_ seventy men from the elders of the people, and he _made them stand_ ^[Literally "caused them to stand"] all around the tent.

###### v25
Then Yahweh went down in the cloud and spoke to him, and he took away the spirit that _was_ on him, and he _put it_ ^[Or "gave it"] on the seventy elders. And as soon as the spirit was resting on them they prophesied, but they did not do it again.

###### v26
But two men were left in the camp; the name of one _was_ Eldad, and the name of the second _was_ Medad, and the spirit rested on them; they were among those who were written _down_, but they did not go out to the tent, so they prophesied in the camp.

###### v27
So a boy ^[Hebrew "the boy"] ran and told Moses and said, "Eldad and Medad _are_ prophesying in the camp."

###### v28
And Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from time of his youth, answered, "Moses, my lord, stop them."

###### v29
But Moses said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? Would that he ^[That is, Yahweh] give all Yahweh's people prophets, that Yahweh put his spirit on them!"

###### v30
Then Moses and the elders of Israel were gathered to the camp.

###### v31
Then a wind set out from Yahweh, and it drove quails from the west, and he spread _them_ out on the camp about a day's journey on one side and about a day's journey on the other, all around the camp, about two cubits on the surface of the land.

###### v32
And so the people _worked_ ^[Literally "arose"] all day and all night and all the next day, and they gathered the quail (the least of the ones collecting gathered ten homers). ^[HALOT 330, "a dry measure"]

###### v33
While the meat _was_ still between their teeth, before it was consumed, Yahweh was angry with the people, and Yahweh struck a very great plague among the people.

###### v34
And he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah ^[Hebrew "the graves of greediness"] because they buried the people that _were greedy_. ^[Literally "craved"]

###### v35
From Kibroth Hattaavah ^[Hebrew "the graves of greediness"] the people set out _to_ Hazeroth; and they stayed ^[Hebrew "they were"] in Hazeroth.
