###### v1
And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he took (because he took a Cushite wife);

###### v2
and they said, "Has Yahweh spoken only through Moses? Has not Yahweh also spoken through us?" And Yahweh heard it.

###### v3
Now the man, Moses, _was_ more humble than any other person on the face of the earth,

###### v4
and Yahweh said suddenly to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, "Go out, you three, to the tent of assembly." So the three of them when out.

###### v5
And Yahweh went down in a column of cloud and stood _at_ the doorway of the tent, and he called Aaron and Miriam, and the two of them went,

###### v6
and he said,
"Please hear my words:
If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh,
will make myself known to him in a vision.
I will speak to him in a dream. ^[Hebrew "the dream"]

###### v7
Not so with my servant Moses;
in all my house he _is_ faithful.

###### v8
I will speak to him mouth to mouth,
_in_ clearness, not in riddles;
and he will look at the form of Yahweh.
Why were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?"

###### v9
_And Yahweh became very angry_ ^[Literally "And the nose of Yahweh became hot"] with them, and he went _away_.

###### v10
And the cloud departed from on the tent, and behold, Miriam _was_ infected with _a skin disease_ ^[The precise meaning is uncertain; many modern translations suggest "leprosy"] white like snow; when Aaron turned toward Miriam, behold, _she was_ afflicted with a skin disease.

###### v11
So Aaron said to Moses, "Please, my lord, please do not put on us _this_ sin _in_ which we were foolish and _in_ which we have sinned.

###### v12
Please do not let her be like the dead, whose flesh is half consumed when coming out from the womb of its mother."

###### v13
And Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, "God, _please heal her_!" ^[Literally "Please heal please her"]

###### v14
But Yahweh said to Moses, "_If_ her father had surely spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be confined for seven days to an outside place of the camp, and afterward she may be gathered."

###### v15
So Miriam was confined to the outside place of the camp seven days, and the people did not set out until Miriam was gathered.

###### v16
And afterward the people set out from Hazeroth, and they encamped in the desert of Paran.
