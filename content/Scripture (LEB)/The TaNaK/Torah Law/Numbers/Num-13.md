And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v2
"Send for yourself men, and let them explore the land of Canaan, which I _am about_ to give to the _Israelites_; ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] _from each tribe of his father send one man_, ^[Literally "one man one man from the tribe of his father"] everyone a leader among them."

###### v3
So Moses sent them from the desert of Paran on the command of Yahweh; all of the men _were_ _leaders_ ^[Literally "heads"] of the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v16
These _are_ the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land. And Moses called Hoshea son of Nun Joshua.

###### v17
Moses sent them to explore the land of Canaan, and he said to them, "Go up _like_ this to the Negev, ^[An arid region south of the Judean hills] and go up into the hill country,

###### v18
and you will see what the land is _like_ and if the people who inhabit it _are_ strong or weak, or whether they are few or many,

###### v19
and whether the land that they _are_ inhabiting _is_ good or bad, and whether the cities they _are_ inhabiting are camps or fortifications,

###### v20
and whether the land _is_ fertile or lean, and whether there are trees on it or not. You will show yourself courageous, and you will take some of the fruit of the land." It _was_ the time of first ripe grapes.

###### v21
So they went up and explored the land from the desert of Zin until Rehob, at Lebo Hamath. ^[Or "near Hamath"]

###### v22
They went up through the Negev ^[An arid region south of the Judean hills] and came to Hebron, where ^[Hebrew "and there"] Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai the descendants of the Anakites _were_. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan _in_ Egypt.)

###### v23
And they came up to the valley ^[Or "wadi"] of Eshcol, and they cut off a vine branch and one cluster of grapes from there; they carried it on _a_ pole between two _men_, _with_ pomegranates and figs.

###### v24
That place he called the valley ^[Or "wadi"] of Eshcol on account of the cluster of grapes that the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] cut off from there.

###### v25
They returned from exploring the land at the end of forty days. ^[Hebrew "day"]

###### v26
And they came ^[Hebrew "they went and came"] to Moses and Aaron and to the entire community of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] in the desert of Paran at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and _to_ all the community, and they showed them the fruit of the land.

###### v27
And they told him, ^[Hebrew "they told him and said"] "We came to the land that you sent us, and it _is_ flowing of milk and honey; this _is_ its fruit.

###### v28
Yet the people who are inhabiting _it are_ strong and the cities _are_ fortified and very large; moreover, we saw the descendants of the Anakites there.

###### v29
_The_ Amalekites _are_ living in the land of the Negev; ^[An arid region south of the Judean hills] the Hittites, Jebusites, and the Amorites _are_ living in the hill country; and the Canaanites _are_ living at the sea and on the banks of the Jordan."

###### v30
And Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "Surely, let us go up and let us take possession of it because surely we will be able to prevail over it."

###### v31
And the men who went up with him said, "We are not able to go up to the people because they _are_ stronger than us."

###### v32
And they presented the report of the land that they explored to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] saying, "The land that we went through to explore _is_ a land that eats its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in its midst _are_ _men of great size_. ^[Literally "men of measurements"]

###### v33
There we saw the Nephilim (the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Anak _came_ from the Nephilim), and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their eyes."
