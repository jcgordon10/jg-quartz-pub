###### v12
According to the number that you prepare, so should you do to each according to their number.

###### v13
Every native must do these _things_ to present an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh.

If an alien dwells among you, or whoever _is_ in your midst throughout your generations, ^[Hebrew "for your generations"] and prepares an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh, he should do as you do.

###### v15
_For_ the assembly, there will be one decree for you and for the alien who dwells _among you_; _it is_ an eternal decree for _all_ your generations. _You as well as the alien_ ^[Literally "like you like the alien"] will be _before Yahweh_. ^[Literally "in the presence of Yahweh"]

###### v16
There will be one law and one stipulation for you and for the alien dwelling among you.'"

###### v17
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v18
"Speak to the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and say to them, 'When you come into the land to which I _am about_ to bring you,

###### v19
whenever you eat from the food of the land, you will lift up a contribution to Yahweh.

###### v20
You must lift up a contribution of the first _batch_ of your ring-shaped dough bread; you must lift it up as a contribution of the threshing floor.

###### v23
all that Yahweh commanded you by the hand of Moses ^[Or "through Moses"] from the day that Yahweh commanded and beyond, throughout your generations, ^[Hebrew "for your generations"]

###### v24
and if it was done unintentionally _without the knowledge_ ^[Literally "from the eyes"] of the community, then the entire community must prepare one _young bull_ ^[Literally "a bull a son of cattle"] as a burnt offering, as a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh, and its grain offering and its libation, according to the stipulation, and one male goat as a sin offering.

###### v25
The priest will make atonement for all of the community of the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and _they will be forgiven_ ^[Literally "it will be forgiven to them"] because it _was_ unintentional; they will bring their offering, an offering made by fire for Yahweh, their sin offering _before Yahweh_ ^[Literally "in the presence of Yahweh"] for their unintentional sin.

###### v26
All of the community of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] will be forgiven, as well as the alien that dwells in their midst, because the whole community _was involved_ in the unintentional wrong.

###### v27
"'If one person sins unintentionally, that person will present a female goat _in its first year_ ^[Literally "a daughter of a year"] as a sin offering.

###### v28
And the priest will make atonement for the person who _sinned unintentionally_ ^[Literally "sinned unintentionally when sinning an unintentional wrong"] _before Yahweh_, ^[Literally "in the presence of Yahweh"] to make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.

###### v29
_For_ the native among the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and the alien that dwells in their midst, there will be one law for anyone who commits an unintentional wrong.

###### v30
But the one _who acts presumptuously_ ^[Literally "who acts with a high hand"] from among the native or alien blasphemes against Yahweh, and that person must be cut off from the midst of the people.

###### v31
Because he despised the word of Yahweh and broke his command, that person will be surely cut off and bear the guilt.'"

###### v32
When the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] were in the desert, they found a man who was gathering wood on the day of the Sabbath.

###### v33
The ones who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and to all the community.

###### v34
And they put him under watch because it was not made clear what should be done to him.

###### v35
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Surely the man must be put to death by stoning him; all the community _must stone him_ with stones from outside the camp."

###### v36
So the entire community brought him out to a place outside the camp, and _they stoned him to death_ ^[Literally "they stoned him with stones and he died"] just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

###### v37
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v38
"Speak to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and tell them to make for themselves tassels ^[Hebrew "tassel"] on the hems of their garments throughout their generations ^[Hebrew "for their generations"] and to put a blue cord on the tassel of the hem.

###### v39
You will have a tassel _for you to look at_ ^[Literally "and you will look at it"] and remember all the commands of Yahweh and do them, and not follow _after the unfaithfulness of your own heart and eyes_, ^[Literally "after your heart and after your eyes, which you _are_ unfaithful after them"]

###### v40
so that you will remember and do all my commandments, and you will be holy for your God.

###### v41
I _am_ Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God; I _am_ Yahweh your God."
