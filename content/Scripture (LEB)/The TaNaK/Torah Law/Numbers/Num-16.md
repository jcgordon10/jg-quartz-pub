[[Num-15|Previous Chapter]] | [[Num-17|Next Chapter]]

###### v1
Now Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben,

###### v2
took two hundred and fifty men from the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] leaders of the community summoned from the assembly, _renowned men_, ^[Literally "men of name"] and _they confronted_ ^[Literally "they rose up before"] Moses.

###### v3
They were assembled in front of Moses and Aaron, and they said to them, "_You take too much upon yourselves_! ^[Literally "It is much for you"] All of the community is holy, every one of them, and Yahweh _is_ in their midst, so why do you raise yourselves over the assembly of Yahweh?"

###### v4
When Moses heard _this_, he fell on his face.

###### v5
And he said to Korah and to his entire company, saying, "_Tomorrow_ morning Yahweh will make known who _is_ his and _who_ is holy, and he will bring him near to him, whomever he chooses he will bring near to him.

###### v6
Do this: take for yourselves censers, Korah and all of your company; ^[Hebrew "his company"]

###### v7
tomorrow put fire in them and place incense on them _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh; the man whom Yahweh chooses _will be_ the holy _one_. You take too much upon yourselves, sons of Levi!"

###### v8
And Moses said to Korah, "Please listen, sons of Levi!

###### v9
_Is it_ too little for you that the God of Israel set you apart from the community of Israel _to allow you to approach him_ ^[Literally "to bring you near to him"] to do the work of the tabernacle of Yahweh, to stand _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] the community to serve them?

###### v10
_He has allowed you to approach him_, ^[Literally "He has brought you near"] you with all your brothers, the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Levi, but yet you also seek the priesthood.

###### v11
Therefore you and your company that has banded together against Yahweh. What is Aaron that you grumble against him?"

###### v12
Moses sent to call _for_ Dathan and Abiram son of Eliab, but they said, "We will not come! ^[Hebrew "We will not come up!"]

###### v13
Is it too little that you have brought us from a land that flows with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, and that you also appoint yourself as a ruler over us?

###### v14
Surely, you have not brought us to a land that flows with milk and honey, and you have not given us the inheritance of fields and a vineyard. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come!" ^[Hebrew "We will not come up!"]

###### v15
Then Moses became angry, and he said to Yahweh, "Do not notice their grain offering. I have not offered one donkey from them, and I have not mistreated one of them."

###### v16
And Moses said to Korah, "You and your entire company will be _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh tomorrow, you and they and Aaron.

###### v17
Each one take his censer, and put incense on it ^[Hebrew "on them"] and you will present it _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh, and each of you bring his censer, two hundred and fifty censers, you and Aaron, each his censer."

###### v18
So each of them took his censer, and they put fire on them, and they placed incense on them; they stood _at the_ doorway of the tent of the assembly of Moses and Aaron.

###### v19
And Korah summoned them, the entire community, by the doorway of the tent of assembly, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the community.

###### v20
And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

###### v21
"Separate yourselves from the midst of this community, that I can destroy them in a moment."

###### v22
And they fell on their faces, and they said, "God, God of the spirits of all flesh, will one man sin and you become angry toward the entire community?"

###### v23
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v24
"Speak to the community, saying, 'Move away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.'"

###### v25
So Moses stood up and went to Dathan and Abiram; the elders of Israel followed after him.

###### v26
He said to the community, saying, "Please turn away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything _that belongs to them_, ^[Literally "that _is_ to them"] or you will be destroyed with all their sins."

###### v27
And so they moved away from around the dwellings ^[Hebrew "dwelling"] of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out standing _at_ the doorway of their tents, with their wives, sons, and little children.

###### v28
And Moses said, "In this you will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; _it is_ not from my heart.

###### v29
_If they die a natural death_ ^[Literally "If they die like the death of every human"] or _if a natural fate is visited upon them_, ^[Literally "If the fate of every human is visited upon them"] Yahweh has not sent me.

###### v30
But if Yahweh creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up and _all that belongs to them_, ^[Literally "All that _is_ for them"] and they go down alive _to_ Sheol, and you will know that these men have despised Yahweh."

###### v31
And it happened, as soon as he finished _speaking_ ^[Literally "to speak"] all these words, the ground that _was_ under them split open.

###### v32
The land opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their houses and every person _that belonged to Korah_ ^[Literally "that was to Korah"] and all the property.

###### v33
They went down alive _to_ Sheol, they and all that belonged to them, and the land covered over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.

###### v34
All Israel who _were_ around them fled at their cry, because they said, "Lest the land swallow us up!"

###### v35
And fire went out from Yahweh, and it consumed the two hundred and fifty men presenting the incense.

###### v36
 ^[[[Num-16#v36|Numbers 16:36–17:13]] in the English Bible is 17:1–28 in the Hebrew Bible] And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v37
"Say to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, '_Take out_ ^[Literally "raise up"] the censers from among the place of burning because they are sacred, and scatter the fire outside.

###### v38
The censers of these _who have sinned_ ^[Literally "sinners"] at the cost of their lives, let them be made into gilded leafing plating for the altar; because they presented them _before Yahweh_, ^[Literally "in the presence of Yahweh"] they are holy; and they will be a sign for the _Israelites_.'" ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v39
Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that the ones who were burned presented, and they hammered them out thinly _as_ plating for the altar;

###### v40
_it was_ a memorial for the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] so that _no strange man_ ^[NASB translates "no layman"] who is not from _the offspring_ ^[Literally "the seed"] of Aaron should approach the presence _of_ Yahweh to burn a smoke offering; ^[That is, an incense offering] he will not be like Korah and his company, just as Yahweh had spoken to him by the hand of Moses. ^[Or "through Moses"]

###### v41
The next day all the community of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You have killed the people of Yahweh!"

###### v42
Then, when the community had gathered against Moses and Aaron, they turned to the tent of assembly, and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared.

###### v43
And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of assembly,

###### v44
and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v45
"Get away from the midst of this community, and I will finish them in an instant," ^[Or "in a moment"] but they fell on their faces.

###### v46
And Moses and Aaron said, "Take the censer, and put fire on it from the altar. Place incense _on it_, and bring it quickly to the community, and make atonement for them, because wrath went out from the presence of Yahweh, and a plague has begun."

###### v47
And so Aaron took _it_ just as Moses had spoken, and he ran into the midst of the assembly, for behold, the plague had begun among the people; so he gave the incense and made atonement for the people.

###### v48
He stood between the dead and between the living, and the plague was stopped.

###### v49
Those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died on account of Korah.

###### v50
Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of assembly, and the plague was stopped.
