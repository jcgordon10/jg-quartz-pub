###### v1
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v2
"Speak to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and take from among them twelve staffs, _a staff from each family_ ^[Literally "a staff from a house of a father"] from among all their leaders according to their families' households. Write the name of each man on his staff,

###### v3
and the name of Aaron on the staff of Levi, because one staff _is_ for the head of _each of_ _their families_. ^[Literally "the house of their fathers"]

###### v4
You must then put them in the tent of assembly _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] the testimony ^[Or "the statute"] where I meet with you.

###### v5
And it will happen, the man whom I will choose, his staff will blossom, and so I will rid from upon myself the grumblings of the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] who _are_ grumbling against you."

###### v6
Moses spoke to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and all their leaders gave him a staff for each leader, one from _each of their families_, ^[Literally "each from the house of their fathers"] twelve staffs, and the staff of Aaron _was_ in the midst of their tribes.

###### v7
And Moses put the staffs before Yahweh in the tent of testimony.

###### v8
Then the next day, Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and behold the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi blossomed and put forth a flower and produced blossoms, and it produced almonds.

###### v9
Then Moses brought out to all the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] all the staffs before the presence of Yahweh, and they saw, and each man took his staff.

###### v10
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Bring back the staff of Aaron before the testimony ^[Or "the statute"] as a guard and sign for the children of rebellion, and let them finish their grumblings before me and not die."

###### v11
So Moses did; just as Yahweh commanded him, so he did.

###### v12
And the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] said to Moses, saying, "Look! We will die! We will be destroyed! All of us will perish!

###### v13
Anyone who approaches the tabernacle of Yahweh will die. _Will we all die_?" ^[Literally "Will we all die to perish?"]
