###### v1
Yahweh said to Aaron, "You, your sons, and your family with you will bear the guilt of the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you will bear the guilt of your priesthood.

###### v2
Moreover, bring your brothers with you, the tribe of Levi the tribe of your father, that they may be joined to you and minister _to_ you, you and your sons with you before the tent of testimony.

###### v3
They will keep your responsibility and the responsibility of all the tent, only they may not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, so both you and they will not die.

###### v4
They will be joined to you, and they will keep the responsibility of the tent of assembly for the entire service of the tent; a stranger may not come near you.

###### v5
You will keep the responsibility of the sanctuary and the responsibility of the altar, and there will no longer be wrath on the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v6
Look, I myself have chosen your brothers the Levites from the midst of the children. They are a gift to you given from Yahweh to perform the work of the tent of assembly.

###### v7
But you with your sons will keep your priesthood to perform your priestly duties for everything at the altar ^[Or "for all the things of the altar"] and for _the area behind the curtain_. ^[Literally "the house of the curtain"] I give you the priesthood as a gift, but the stranger who approaches will be put to death."

###### v8
Yahweh spoke to Aaron, "Behold, I myself have given to you the responsibility of my contributions for all the holy objects of the _Israelites_; ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] I have given them as a portion to you and your sons as an eternal decree.

###### v9
This will be for you from the sanctuary of the holy things from the fire; all of their offerings, from every grain offering, from every sin offering, and from every guilt offering which they will bring to me _is_ _a most holy thing_ ^[Literally "a holy object of holiness"] for you and your sons.

###### v10
You will eat it in the most holy place; ^[Alternatively "as a holy object of holiness"] every male will eat it. It will be a holy object to you.

###### v11
This _is also_ for you: the contribution of their gift of the wave offerings of the children Israel. I have given them to you and your sons and your daughters with you as an eternal decree; whoever _is_ clean in your house may eat it.

###### v12
All _the_ finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and their best grain that they have given to Yahweh, I have given them to you.

###### v13
_The_ firstfruits of all that _is_ in their land that they present to Yahweh will be for you; whoever _is_ clean in your house may eat it.

###### v14
All consecrated possessions ^[Hebrew "possession"] in Israel will be for you.

###### v15
All _the_ first offspring of a womb of any creature that they offer to Yahweh, whether human or animal, will be yours; you will surely redeem the firstborn of the human and the unclean firstborn of the animal.

###### v16
As to their price of redemption, from _a one-month-old_ ^[Literally "a son of a month"] you will redeem them according to your proper value, five shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which _is_ twenty gerah.

###### v17
Only the firstborn of an ox or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat you will not redeem; they _are_ holy. Their blood you will sprinkle over the altar, and their fat you will turn into smoke _as_ an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh.

###### v18
But their flesh will be for you like the breast section of the wave offering, and it will be for you like the right upper thigh.

###### v19
All the contributions of holiness that the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] offer to Yahweh I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you as an eternal decree; it _is_ an eternal covenant of salt _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh to you and your offspring with you."

###### v20
Then Yahweh said to Aaron, "You will not receive an inheritance in their land, and there will not be a plot of ground for you in the midst of the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v21
"Behold, I have given to the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Levi every tithe in Israel as an inheritance in return for their service, which they _are_ doing, the work of the tent of assembly.

###### v22
The _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] will not come near again to the tent of assembly, or _they will bear sin_ ^[The NRSV translates "they will incur guilt"] and die.

###### v23
The Levites ^[Hebrew "Levite"] will perform the service of the tent of assembly, and they will bear their guilt, an eternal decree for all your generations. But they will not receive an inheritance in the midst of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v24
because the tithes ^[Hebrew "tithe"] of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] that are _offered_ ^[Hebrew "raised up"] to Yahweh as a contribution, I have given to the Levites as an inheritance; therefore I said to them, 'They will not receive an inheritance in the midst of the _Israelites_.'" ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v25
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v26
"You will speak to the Levites and say to them, 'When you receive the tithe from the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] that I have given to you from them for your inheritance, _you will present_ ^[Literally "you will raise up"] a contribution from it to Yahweh, a tithe from a tithe.

###### v27
Your contribution will be credited to you like the grain from the threshing floor and like the produce from the press.

###### v28
So _you will present_ ^[Literally "you will raise up"] your own contribution to Yahweh from all your tithes that you receive from the _Israelites_; ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] from it you will give the contribution of Yahweh to Aaron the priest.

###### v29
From all your gifts _you will present_ ^[Literally "you will raise up"] every contribution of Yahweh, from all its fat, the part _that is_ sacred.'

###### v30
You will say to them, 'When _you are presenting_ ^[Literally "you are raising up"] its fat, the rest will be credited to the Levites like a yield of the threshing floor and like a yield from the press.

###### v31
You may eat it anywhere, you and your household, because it _is_ a wage in return for your service in the tent of assembly.

###### v32
You will not bear any sin because _you have presented_ ^[Literally "you have raised up"] its fat; you will not defile the holy objects of the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] or you will die.'"
