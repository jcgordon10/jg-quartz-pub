###### v1
Then the entire community of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] came _to_ the desert of Zin on the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh; Miriam died and was buried there.

###### v2
There was no water for the community, and they were gathered before Moses and Aaron.

###### v3
And the people quarreled with Moses and spoke, saying, "If only we died when our brothers were dying _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh!

###### v4
Why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh, us and our livestock, into this desert to die here?

###### v5
Why have you brought us from Egypt to bring us to this bad place? It is not a place of seed or figs ^[Hebrew "fig"] or vines ^[Hebrew "vine"] or pomegranate trees, ^[Hebrew "tree"] and there is not water to drink."

###### v6
And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of assembly. They fell on their faces, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them.

###### v7
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v8
"Take the staff and summon the community, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will give water. Bring out for them water from the rock, and let the community and their livestock drink."

###### v9
So Moses took the staff from _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh just as he command him,

###### v10
and Moses and Aaron summoned the assembly to the presence of the rock, and he said to them, "Please listen, you rebels; can we bring out water for you from this rock?"

###### v11
Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice. And abundant water went out, and the community and their livestock drank.

###### v12
But Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you have not trusted in me, to regard me as holy _in the sight of_ ^[Or "before the eyes of"] the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] you will not bring this assembly into the land that I have given to them."

###### v13
Those _were_ the waters of Meribah, where the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] quarreled with Yahweh, and he showed himself holy among them.

###### v14
From Kadesh Moses sent messengers to the king of Edom: "Thus your brother Israel has said, 'You know all the hardship that has found us;

###### v15
our ancestors ^[Or "fathers"] went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt _a long time_, ^[Literally "many days"] and the Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v16
Then we cried to Yahweh, and he heard our voice; he sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt. And look, we _are_ in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory.

###### v17
Please let us go through your land. We will not go through a field or vineyard, and we will not drink water from a well. We will go along the road of the king; we will not turn aside right or left until we have gone through your territory.'"

###### v18
Then Edom said to him, "You will not pass through us ^[Hebrew "me"] lest _we will go out_ ^[Hebrew "I will go out"] to meet you with the sword."

###### v19
The _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] said to him, "We will go up on the main road, and if we ^[Hebrew "I"] and our livestock ^[Hebrew "my livestock"] drink your water, we will pay _for it_. ^[Hebrew "I will give their worth"] It is only a small matter; let us pass through on our feet." ^[Hebrew "I will go through on my feet"]

###### v20
But he said, "You will not go through." And Edom went out to meet _them_ ^[Hebrew "him"] with a large army and a strong hand.

###### v21
So Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, and Israel turned aside from him.

###### v22
And they set out from Kadesh. The _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] the whole community, came _to_ Mount Hor.

###### v23
Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron on Mount Hor, on the boundary of the land of Edom, saying,

###### v24
"Let Aaron be gathered to his people; he will not come into the land that I have given to the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] because you rebelled against _my word_ ^[Literally "my mouth"] at the waters of Meribah.

###### v25
Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and take them up Mount Hor.

###### v26
Strip off Aaron's garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; Aaron will be gathered _to his people_, and he will die there."

###### v27
So Moses did just as Yahweh commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor before the eyes of all the community.

###### v28
And Moses stripped off Aaron's garments and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there on the top of the mountain; and Moses and Eleazar went down from the mountain.

###### v29
All the community saw that Aaron died; so all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days. ^[Hebrew "day"]
