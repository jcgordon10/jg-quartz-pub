###### v1
The Canaanite king of Arad, who was dwelling _in_ the Negev, ^[An arid region south of the Judean hills] heard that Israel came _along_ the way of Atharim; he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.

###### v2
Israel made a vow to Yahweh, and they said, "If you will surely give this people into our ^[Hebrew "my"] hand, then we ^[Hebrew "I"] _will destroy_ ^[Literally "devote to God"] their cities."

###### v3
Yahweh heard the voice of Israel; he gave _to them_ the Canaanites, and _they destroyed them_ ^[Literally "they devoted to God"] and their cities. They called the name of the place Hormah.

###### v4
They set out from Mount Hor _by_ the way of the _Red Sea_ ^[Literally "sea of reed"] to go around the land of Edom; but _the people became impatient_ ^[Literally "the life of the people became short"] along the way.

###### v5
The people spoke against God and against Moses, "Why have you brought us from Egypt to die in the desert? There is no food and no water, and our hearts detest _this_ miserable food."

###### v6
And Yahweh sent among the people poisonous snakes; they bit the people, and many people from Israel died.

###### v7
The people came to Moses and said, "We have sinned because we have spoken against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh and let him remove the snakes ^[Hebrew "snake"] from among us." So Moses prayed for the people.

###### v8
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Make for yourself a snake and place it on a pole. When ^[Hebrew "And it will happen"] anyone is bitten and looks at it, that person will live."

###### v9
So Moses made a snake of bronze, and he placed it on the pole; whenever ^[Hebrew "And it will happen"] a snake bit someone, and that person looked at the snake of bronze, he lived.

###### v10
The _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] set out and encamped at Oboth.

###### v11
They set out from Oboth and encamped at Iye Abarim in the desert, which _was_ in front of Moab _toward the sunrise_. ^[Literally "from the east of the sun"]

###### v12
From there they set out and encamped at the valley of Zered.

###### v13
From there they set out and encamped beyond Arnon, which _is_ in the desert that goes out from the boundary of the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] because Arnon _is_ the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. ^[Hebrew "Amorite"]

###### v14
Therefore thus it is said in the scroll of the Wars of Yahweh,
"Waheb in Suphah,
and the wadis of Arnon,

###### v15
and the slope of the wadis
that spreads out to the dwelling of Ar
and lies at the boundary of Moab."

###### v16
From there _they went_ to Beer, which is the water well where Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Gather the people, that I may give them water."

###### v17
Then Israel sang this song, "Arise, well water! Sing to it!

###### v18
Well water that the princes dug, that the leaders of the people dug, with a staff _and_ with their rods." And from _the_ desert _they continued to_ Mattanah,

###### v19
and from Mattanah _to_ Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel _to_ Bamoth;

###### v20
and from Bamoth to the valley that _is_ in the territory of Moab, _by_ the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the surface of the wasteland.

###### v21
Israel sent messengers to Sihon, the king of the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] saying,

###### v22
"Let us go through your land; we will not turn aside into a field or vineyard; we will not drink well water along the way of the king until we have gone through your territory."

###### v23
But Sihon did not allow Israel to go through his territory. Sihon gathered all his people and went out to meet Israel; he came _to_ the desert, to Jahaz, and he fought against Israel.

###### v24
But Israel struck him with _the_ edge of _the_ sword, and they took possession of his land from Arnon to Jabbok, until the _Ammonites_, ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] because the boundary of the _Ammonites_ ^[Literally "sons of Ammon"] _was_ strong.

###### v25
Israel took all these cities, and Israel inhabited all the cities of the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] in Heshbon, and in all its environs. ^[Hebrew "her daughters;" other modern versions translate "its villages"]

###### v26
Because Heshbon _was_ the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land from his hand until Arnon.

###### v27
Thus the ones who quote proverbs say,
"Come _to_ Heshbon! Let it be built!
And let the city of Sihon be established.

###### v28
Because fire went out from Heshbon,
a flame from the city of Sihon;
it consumed Ar of Moab,
the lords of the ^[Or "the dominant"] high places of Arnon.

###### v29
Woe to you, Moab!
You have perished, people of Chemosh.
He has given his sons as fugitives,
and his daughters into captivity,
to the king of the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] Sihon.

###### v30
    We destroyed them;
Heshbon has perished up to Dibon;
we laid waste up to Nophah,
which _reaches_ ^[Literally "_is_ up to"] Medeba."

###### v31
Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. ^[Hebrew "Amorite"]

###### v32
Moses sent to explore Jaazer; they captured _its environs_ ^[Hebrew "her daughters;" other modern versions translate "its villages"] and dispossessed the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] who _were_ there.

###### v33
Then they turned and went up _by_ the way of the Bashan, and Og king of the Bashan and all his people went out to meet them for battle _at_ Edrei.

###### v34
And Yahweh said to Moses, "Do not fear him because I will give him and all his people and all his land into your hand. You will do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] who was living in Heshbon."

###### v35
And so they destroyed him and his sons, and all his people until they had not spared a survivor; and they took possession of his land.
