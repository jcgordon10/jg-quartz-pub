###### v1
The _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] set out, and they encamped on the desert-plateau of Moab, across from Jericho beyond _the_ Jordan.

###### v2
Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel did to the Amorites, ^[Hebrew "Amorite"]

###### v3
and Moab was very terrified in the presence of the people because _they_ ^[Hebrew "he" or "it"] _were_ numerous; and Moab dreaded the presence of the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v4
And Moab said to the elders of Midian, "Now the crowd will lick up all around us, like a bull devours the grass of the field." And Balak son of Zippor _was_ king of Moab at that time.

###### v5
He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor _at_ Pethor, which _is_ by the river, ^[That is, the Euphrates] in the land of the children of his people, to summon him, saying, "Look! A people went out from Egypt. Look! They cover _the surface of the land_; ^[Literally "the eye of the land"] they _are about_ to dwell opposite me.

###### v6
Now, please go, curse this people for me because they ^[Hebrew "he"] _are_ stronger than me; perhaps I will be able to strike them ^[Hebrew "he"] and drive them ^[Hebrew "he"] out from the land because I know whoever you bless _is_ blessed, and whoever you cursed is cursed."

###### v7
So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went _with_ a fee for divination in their hand; they came to Balaam and spoke the words of Balak to him.

###### v8
He said to them, "Spend the night here, and I will return, and I will return word to you, just as Yahweh speaks to me." So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.

###### v9
And God came to Balaam and said, "Who _are_ these men with you?"

###### v10
And Balaam said to God, "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent _word_ to me,

###### v11
'Look! A people went out from Egypt. Look! They cover _the surface of the land_. ^[Literally "the eye of the land"] Now, go, curse them ^[Hebrew "him"] for me. Perhaps I will be able to attack them ^[Hebrew "him"] and drive them ^[Hebrew "him"] out."

###### v12
God said to Balaam, "You will not go with them; you will not curse the people, because they ^[Hebrew "he"] _are_ blessed."

###### v13
Balaam got up in the morning, and he said to the princes of Balak, "Go to your land, because Yahweh refused to allow me to go with you."

###### v14
The princes of Moab got up and went to Balak, and they said, "Balaam refused to come with us."

###### v15
Balak again sent many princes, _who were more_ honored _than the former_. ^[Literally "than these"]

###### v16
They came to Balaam and said to him, "Thus says Balak son of Zippor, 'Please, let nothing keep you from coming to me

###### v17
because I will surely honor you greatly, and all that you say to me I will do. Please, come; curse this people for me.'"

###### v18
Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, "Even though Balak gives to me his house full of silver and gold, I am not able to go beyond _the command of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "the mouth of Yahweh"] my God to do a little or a lot.

###### v19
And now please, _you also stay here_ ^[Literally "please stay in this"] the night, and _let me find out_ ^[Literally "let me know"] again what Yahweh will say with me."

###### v20
And God came to Balaam _at_ night, and he said to him, "If the men have come to call you, get up _and_ go with them; but only the word that I will speak to you, you will do."

###### v21
So Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey, and he went with the princes of Moab.

###### v22
But _God became angry_ ^[Literally "God's nose became hot"] because he was going, and the angel of Yahweh stood in the road as an adversary to him; he _was_ riding on his donkey, and two servants were with him.

###### v23
The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and the donkey turned aside from the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back _to_ the road.

###### v24
The angel of Yahweh stood in the narrow path of the vineyards, _with_ _a wall on either side_. ^[Literally "a wall from this and a wall from this"]

###### v25
When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she pressed herself into the wall, and she pressed the foot of Balaam into the wall, so he struck her again.

###### v26
Then the angel of Yahweh went further ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was not a way to turn aside _to the_ right or left.

###### v27
When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she lay down under Balaam, so _Balaam became angry_, ^[Literally "Balaam's nose became hot"] and he struck the donkey with _his_ staff.

###### v28
Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What did I do to you that you struck me these three times?"

###### v29
Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you made a mockery of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!"

###### v30
The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life until this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?" He said, "No."

###### v31
Then Yahweh exposed the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and he bowed down and worshiped to his face.

###### v32
The angel of Yahweh said to him, "Why have you struck this donkey three times? Look, I have come out as an adversary because your conduct is perverse before me.

###### v33
The donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If she had not turned aside from my face, then I would have killed you and kept her alive."

###### v34
Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, "I have sinned because I did not know that you _were_ standing to meet me in the road. Now, _if it is displeasing to you_, ^[Literally "if it is evil in your eyes"] I will turn back."

###### v35
The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but speak only the word that I will speak to you." So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

###### v36
When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him by the city of Moab, which _was_ on the boundary of Aaron at the end of the territory.

###### v37
And Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not urgently send to meet with you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really not able to honor you?"

###### v38
Balaam said to Balak, "Look, I came to you now. Am I really able to speak anything at all? I speak the word that God puts in my mouth."

###### v39
Balaam went with Balak, and they came _to_ Kiriath-Huzoth.

###### v40
And Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and he sent _them_ to Balaam and to the princes who _were_ with him.

###### v41
And it happened, in the morning Balak took Balaam and took him up to Bamoth-Baal, and he saw from there the end of the nation.
