###### v1
And Balaam saw that _it pleased_ ^[Literally "it was good in the eyes of Yahweh"] Yahweh to bless Israel, and he did not go _as other times_ ^[Literally "as time on time"] _to seek out_ ^[Literally "to meet"] sorcery; instead, he set his face toward the desert.

###### v2
Balaam lift up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to its tribes, and the spirit of God was upon it. ^[That is, Israel]

###### v3
He _uttered_ ^[Literally "lifted up"] his oracle and said,
"The declaration of Balaam son Beor,
the declaration of the man _whose_ eyes are closed,

###### v4
the declaration of the hearer of God's words, ^[Or "God's sayings"]
who sees the revelation of Shaddai, ^[Often translated "the Almighty"]
falling down but _whose_ eyes are uncovered.

###### v5
    How good are your tents, O Jacob,
your dwellings, O Israel!

###### v6
    They are spread out like valleys,
like gardens on a river,
like aloes planted by Yahweh,
like cedars at _the_ waters.

###### v7
    He will pour water from his buckets,
and his offspring _will be_ like many waters;
his king will be higher than Agag,
and his kingdom will be exalted.

###### v8
    God, who brings him out from Egypt,
_is_ like the strength ^[Or "the horns"] of a wild ox for him.
He will devour _the_ nations _who are_ his enemies;
he will break their bones;
he will pierce _them with_ his arrows.

###### v9
He crouches, he lies down like a lion,
and like a lioness, who will rouse him?
_They who_ bless you will be blessed,
and _they who_ curse you will be cursed."

###### v10
Then _Balak became angry with_ ^[Literally "the nose of Balak became hot against"] Balaam, and he clapped his hands and said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, but look, you have surely blessed _them_ these three times.

###### v11
_Flee_ ^[Literally "Flee for yourself"] to your place now. I said I would richly honor you, but look, Yahweh has withheld honor from you."

###### v12
Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,

###### v13
'If Balak gave to me the fullness of his house full of silver and gold, I am not able to go beyond _the command of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "the mouth of Yahweh"] to do good or evil, from my heart; what Yahweh speaks, I will speak'? ^[Hebrew "I will speak it"]

###### v14
And now, look, I _am about_ to go to my people; I will advise you what this people will do to your people _in the following days_." ^[Literally "in the last of the days"]

###### v15
And he _uttered_ ^[Literally "lifted up"] his oracle and said,
"The declaration of Balaam son of Beor,
and the declaration of the man whose eye is closed,

###### v16
the declaration of the hearer of God's words, ^[Or "God's sayings"]
and the knower of the knowledge of the Most High,
who sees the vision of Shaddai, ^[Often translated "the Almighty"]
who is falling, and _his_ eyes _are_ revealed.

###### v17
I see him, but not now;
I behold him, but not near;
a star will go out from Jacob,
and a scepter will rise from Israel;
it will crush the foreheads of Moab
and destroy all the children of Seth.

###### v18
Edom will be a captive;
Seir, its enemies, will be a captive,
and Israel _will be_ acting _courageously_. ^[Literally "_with_ physical strength"]

###### v19
    Someone ^[Hebrew "He"] from Jacob will rule
and will destroy a remnant ^[Or "survivor"] from the city."

###### v20
    And he looked _at_ Amalek, _uttered_ ^[Literally "lifted up"] his oracle, and said,
"Amalek _is_ first ^[Or "among"] of _the_ nations,
but his future _will be_ forever ruin."

###### v21
And he looked _at_ the Kenites, ^[Hebrew "Kenite"] _uttered_ ^[Literally "lifted up"] his oracle, and said,
"Steady _is_ your dwelling place;
in the rock is your nest.

###### v22
Nevertheless, _the_ Kenite will be burned;
how long will Asshur keep ^[Hebrew "take"] you captive?"

###### v23
Again he _uttered_ ^[Literally "lifted up"] his oracle and said,
"Woe, who will live when God establishes this? ^[Hebrew "it"]

###### v24
    The ships _will come_ from the hand of the Kittim,
and they will afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber;
also he _will be_ forever ruin."

###### v25
Then Balaam got up and went and returned to his place, and Balak also went on his way.
