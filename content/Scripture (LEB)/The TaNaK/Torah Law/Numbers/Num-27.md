###### v1
Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, of the clan of Manasseh the son of Joseph, came near; and these _were_ the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, and Tirzah.

###### v2
They stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the leaders of the entire community _at_ the doorway of the tent of assembly, ^[Or "meeting"] saying,

###### v3
"Our father died in the desert; he was not in the midst of the company of those who banded together against Yahweh in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons.

###### v4
Why should the name of our father disappear from the midst of his clan because he does not have a son? Give us property in the midst of the brothers of our father."

###### v5
So Moses brought their case before Yahweh.

###### v6
And Yahweh said to Moses, saying,

###### v7
"_The statements of the daughters of Zelophehad are right_. ^[Literally "Such as the daughters of Zelophehad _are_ speaking"] You must surely give them _the_ property of an inheritance in the midst of their father's brothers, and you must transfer the inheritance of their father to them.

###### v8
And you must speak to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] saying, 'If a man dies and has no son, you must transfer his inheritance to his daughter.

###### v9
And if he has no daughter, you must give his inheritance to his brothers.

###### v10
If he has no brothers, then you must give his inheritance to his father's brothers.

###### v11
If his father has no brothers, then you must give his inheritance to his nearest relative from his own clan, and he will take possession of it. It will be as a decree of stipulation for the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] just as Yahweh commanded Moses.'"

###### v12
Yahweh said to Moses, "Go up to this mountain of Abarim, and see the land that I have given to the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v13
When you see it, you will be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother was gathered,

###### v14
because you rebelled against my word in the desert of Zin when the community quarreled regarding my holiness at the waters." (These _are_ the waters of Meribah-Kadesh _in_ the desert of Zin.)

###### v15
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

###### v16
"Let Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the community

###### v17
who will go out before them and will come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, so the community of Yahweh will not be like a flock that does not have a shepherd."

###### v18
Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is _the_ spirit, and place your hand on him.

###### v19
Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before the entire community, and _commission him_ ^[Literally "command him"] _in their sight_. ^[Literally "before their eyes"]

###### v20
You will give to him from your authority so that the entire community of Israel will _obey him_. ^[Literally "hear _him_"]

###### v21
He will stand before Eleazar the priest, who will ask for him by the decision ^[Or "judgment"] of the Urim before Yahweh. On _his command_ ^[Literally "his word"] they will go out, and at _his command_ ^[Literally "his word"] they will come in, _both_ he and all of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] with him, the entire community."

###### v22
Moses did just as Yahweh commanded him, and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before the entire community.

###### v23
And he placed his hands on him and _commissioned him_ ^[Literally "commanded him"] just as Yahweh spoke by the hand of Moses. ^[Or "through Moses"]
