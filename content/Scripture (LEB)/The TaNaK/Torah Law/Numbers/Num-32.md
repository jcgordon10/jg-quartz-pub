###### v1
The descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben and the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Gad had a very large number of livestock. And they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold it _was_ a place for livestock.

###### v2
The descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Gad and the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben came, and they said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, saying,

###### v3
"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,

###### v4
the land that Yahweh struck before the community of Israel, _is_ a land of livestock, and your servants have livestock."

###### v5
They said, "If we have found favor in _your sight_, ^[Literally "your eyes"] let this land be given to your servants as property; do not lead us _across_ the Jordan."

###### v6
But Moses said to the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Gad and to the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben, "Will your brothers go to war while you yourselves live here?

###### v7
Why are you discouraging the hearts of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] from crossing into the land that Yahweh gave to them?

###### v8
This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.

###### v9
When they went up to the valley ^[Or "the wadi"] of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] so that they did not come to the land that Yahweh gave to them.

###### v10
So _Yahweh's anger burned_ ^[Literally "Yahweh's nose became hot"] on that day, and he swore an oath, saying,

###### v11
'The men who went up from Egypt, from _those twenty years old_ ^[Literally "a son of twenty years"] and above, will not see the land that I swore with an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob because they have not wholly followed me,

###### v12
except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, because they followed Yahweh wholly.'

###### v13
And _Yahweh became angry_, ^[Literally "Yahweh's nose became hot"] and he made them wander in the desert forty years until the entire generation who did evil in the _sight of Yahweh_ ^[Literally "eyes of Yahweh"] _had died_. ^[Literally "had completed"]

###### v14
Behold, you stand in the place of your fathers, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more _Yahweh's fierce anger_ ^[Literally "the fierce anger of Yahweh's nose"] against Israel.

###### v15
If you turn from following him, he will again abandon them ^[Hebrew "him"] in the wilderness, and you would have destroyed all these people."

###### v16
They came near to him and said, "We will build sheep pens here for _the_ flock of our livestock and cities for our little children;

###### v17
but we ourselves will become armed _and_ ready before the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] until we have brought them to their place, and our little children will live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

###### v18
We will not return to our houses until the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] each obtain their ^[Hebrew "his"] inheritance for themselves.

###### v19
For we will not take possession with them from across the Jordan and beyond because our inheritance has come to us from across the Jordan to the east."

###### v20
So Moses said to them, "If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh for the war,

###### v21
and everyone of you armed cross the Jordan _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh until he has driven out his enemies from before him,

###### v22
and the land is subdued _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh, then afterward you will return and be free of obligation from Yahweh and from Israel, and this land will be your property _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh.

###### v23
But if you do not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh, and know that your sin will find you.

###### v24
Build for yourselves cities for your little children and sheep pens for your flocks; what has gone out from your mouth you will do."

###### v25
So the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Gad and the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben said to Moses, saying, "Your servants will do just as my lord commands.

###### v26
Our little children, our wives, our livestock, and all of our animals ^[Hebrew "animal"] _will remain_ ^[Literally "will be there"] in the cities of Gilead,

###### v27
but your servants, everyone who is armed for battle, will cross over _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh to the war, just as my lord says."

###### v28
So Moses commanded them, Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the _families_ ^[Literally "fathers"] of the tribes of the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v29
Moses said to them, "If the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Gad and the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben, everyone who is armed for the war, cross over the Jordan _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh, and the land is subdued before you, you will give them the land of Gilead as property.

###### v30
But if they will not cross over with you armed, they will acquire land in your midst in Canaan."

###### v31
The descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Gad and the descendants of Reuben answered and said, "What Yahweh has commanded your servants, we will do.

###### v32
We ourselves will cross over armed _before_ ^[Literally "in the presence of"] Yahweh to the land of Canaan, and the property of our inheritance _will remain_ with us beyond the Jordan."

###### v33
So Moses gave to them, to the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Gad and the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben, and to half of the tribe of Joseph's son Manasseh, the kingdom of Sihon the king of Amorites and the kingdom of Og the king of the Bashan, the land with its cities _and their_ territories, the cities of the surrounding land.

###### v34
The descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, and Aroer,

###### v35
and Atroth Shophan, Jazer, and Jogbehah,

###### v36
and Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran, the cities of Mibzar, and the sheep pens for flocks.

###### v37
The descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,

###### v38
and Nebo, Baal Meon (their names ^[Hebrew "name"] _were_ changed), and Sibmah, and _they renamed_ ^[Literally "they called to names the names"] the cities that they rebuilt.

###### v39
The descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and they captured it and drove out the Amorites ^[Hebrew "Amorite"] who _were_ in it.

###### v40
So Moses gave Gilead to Makir son of Manasseh, and he lived in it.

###### v41
And Jair son of Manasseh went and captured their unwalled villages, and he called them Havvoth Jair.

###### v42
Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and he called it Nobah after his _own_ name.
