[[Num-35|Previous Chapter]]

###### v1
_The leaders_ ^[Literally "The heads"] of the families ^[Or "fathers"] of the clans of descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Gilead the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, of the clans of the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Joseph came near and spoke _before_ ^[Literally "before the face of"] Moses and _before_ ^[Literally "before the face of"] _the leaders_ ^[Literally "the heads"] of the families ^[Hebrew "of the fathers"] of the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v2
And they said, "Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land by lot as an inheritance to the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.

###### v3
But if they become wives to one of the sons from _another_ tribe of the _Israelites_, ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] their inheritance will disappear from the inheritance of our ancestors, ^[Or "fathers"] and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; the lot of our inheritance would disappear.

###### v4
When the Jubilee of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] _comes_, ^[Literally "will be"] it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; and their inheritance will disappear from the tribe of our father."

###### v5
Then Moses commanded the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] by the command of Yahweh, saying, "The tribe of the descendants ^[Or "sons"] of Joseph _is_ right _regarding what they are_ speaking.

###### v6
This _is_ the word that Yahweh commanded the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, '_Let them marry_ ^[Literally "Let them be as wives"] _whomever they like_; ^[Literally "they will be as the good in their eyes"] only _they must marry_ ^[Literally "they must be as wives"] from within the clan of the tribe of their father.

###### v7
Thus an inheritance of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] will not go around from tribe to tribe. Rather, the inheritance of each tribe of his father will remain with the _Israelites_. ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"]

###### v8
Every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribes of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] will _marry_ ^[Literally "be a wife to"] one of the clan of the tribe of her father, so that the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] will possess the inheritance of his ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v9
Therefore an inheritance will not go around from _one_ tribe to another tribe because the tribes of the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] will each hold to their _own_ inheritance.'"

###### v10
Just as Yahweh commanded to Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did:

###### v11
Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, _married_ ^[Literally "were as wives to"] the sons of their uncles.

###### v12
_They married_ ^[Literally "They were as wives to"] those from the sons of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance _remained_ ^[Literally "was"] among the tribe of the clan of their ancestors. ^[Or "fathers"]

###### v13
These _were_ the commands and the stipulations that Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses ^[Or "through Moses"] to the _Israelites_ ^[Literally "sons/children of Israel"] on the desert-plateaus of Moab by the Jordan _across_ Jericho.
