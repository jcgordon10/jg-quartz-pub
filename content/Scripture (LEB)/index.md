This is a markdown copy of the Lexham English Bible, which I use integrated into my notes to be able to hyperlink to passages. I don't keep any commentary or notes in this directory, only an organized copy of the scripture for linking to. Any notes on passages will be elsewhere, but can be found by going to a passage
