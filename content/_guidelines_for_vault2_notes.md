# Filenames
undecided. obsidian already prevents special characters. It's a weird tradeoff between having readable filenames in obsidian that don't have spell check on them, but that would also be highly processable by a computer system, like if I wanted files to be ingested by an llm.

# Folder Structure
Try to keep a logical folder structure. The structure will probably also mirror MOCs

# Tags
Based on this [article](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Tags_are_an_ineffective_association_structure?stackedNotes=zRaJxQBJgbD5wgRYLoqTpa3) tags should be discouraged and instead direct links should be favored. I'm opting to use MOC's (Map of Content) as like tables of contents to try and connect notes and make things more discoverable

# MOCs
I plan to have a Map of Content for almost ever major folder division.
I'm trying to create summaries of a note to make it more searchable in the MOC.
