Welcome! This site contains personal notes of mine that I am in the process of publishing. The notes may be a variety of things, and I have tried to divide them up in a reasonable manner. Some of the notes may be more personal thoughts or observations on topics as I study through it, others are more straightforward lecture style notes from material that I have listened to. I think that this process of note-taking and publishing is helpful to digesting the material and organizing it in my mind, as well as keeping a record of the material for reference.

I am trying to use a "Map of Content" strategy where I keep a series of indexes, much like nested tables of contents. This is both to help organize things mentally, and to aid in finding or discovering material.

In addition to the more traditional hierarchical system of organizing notes, I would like to try and have my notes be hyperlinked as much as I can to both other internal notes, and external sources. This results in there being much more a web of ideas that are all connected in various ways, and is more organic in connection. One note may be linked to from many places, and this forms a natural hierarchy of important thoughts. This will happen more as I add more notes. 

I have an existing collection of notes which is in various stages of organization or quality. I have been adjusting my style of how I like to build my notes, and so am in the process of working through old notes and reformatting or updating them to be moved into this published repository.

# Site Structure

- **[[Journal/index|Journal]]:** Chronological notes, where I will post thoughts and updates. Because of the organic and living nature of this site, this Journal area may also be the best place for me to share about what new information I've added to the site.
- **[[Lecture Notes/index|Lecture Notes]]:** Straightforward notes, summarizing the content of material I have watched, read, or listened to.
- **[[Reflections/index|Reflections]]:** More opinionated commentary or observations about topics, that may include and encompass multiple different sources of material I've consumed. The more personal and digested reflections on topics.
- **[[Scripture (LEB)/index|The Markdown Bible]]:** A utility copy of the Bible that I use for linking passages and embedding references in my collection of notes. Just the biblical text here, no commentary.

⚠️ Some of the material (particularly in Lecture Notes) may come from diverse traditions or viewpoints, and I would not say that having notes on the material is an endorsement from me of that view. Nevertheless, these are views or sources that I am interested in listening to and genuinely understanding, to either grow or correct myself, or to understand where the fault may lie in that view from an apologetic standpoint.
