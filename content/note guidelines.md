# Quartz Metadata:
- `title`: Title of the page. If it isn’t provided, Quartz will use the name of the file as the title.
- `description`: Description of the page used for link previews. (like SEO?)
- `permalink`: A custom URL for the page that will remain constant even if the path to the file changes.
- `aliases`: Other names for this note. This is a list of strings.
- `tags`: Tags for this note.
- `draft`: Whether to publish the page or not. This is one way to make [pages private](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/private-pages) in Quartz.
- `date`: A string representing the day the note was published. Normally uses `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

# Filenames
undecided. obsidian already prevents special characters. It's a weird tradeoff between having readable filenames in obsidian that don't have spell check on them, but that would also be highly processable by a computer system, like if I wanted files to be ingested by an llm.

# Folder Structure
Try to keep a logical folder structure. The structure will probably also mirror MOCs

# Tags
Based on this [article](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Tags_are_an_ineffective_association_structure?stackedNotes=zRaJxQBJgbD5wgRYLoqTpa3) tags should be discouraged and instead direct links should be favored. I'm opting to use MOC's (Map of Content) as like tables of contents to try and connect notes and make things more discoverable

# MOCs
I plan to have a Map of Content for almost ever major folder division.
I'm trying to create summaries of a note to make it more searchable in the MOC.
